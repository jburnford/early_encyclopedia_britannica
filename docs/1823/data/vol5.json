[{"h":"ACEPHALA CONCHIFERA","t":"The shell, which in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>, is bivalve, and exhibits very remarkable differences in the form\nrelative size, and connection of the valves. The cloak is likewise in the form of two leaves, corresponding with the valves which protect it.\n\n1. Order.\n\nBrachiopoda.\n\nMouth with a spiral arm on each side fringed with filaments.\n\nThe genera included in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> constitute the Brachiopoda of Cuvier. The lobes of the cloak are free anteriorly. From the body, between the lobes, the arms have their origin, at the margin of the mouth. These arms are capable of folding up spirally. All the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> are permanently attached to foreign bodies, and inhabit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Their nervous and reproductive systems have received but little elucidation.\n\n1. Subdivision.\n\nShell supported on a fleshy peduncle.\n\nGenus, Lingula.\u2014Valves equal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> of both attached to the peduncle.\n\nThe peduncle is nearly cylindrical, cartilaginous, and covered with a membrane consisting of circular fibres. The valves are oval, flat, and destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> ligaments. The adductor muscles are numerous, obliquely placed, and appear capable of giving to the valves a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of lateral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. The cloak is thin, and has interspersed muscular fibres. Its margin is thickened, and fringed with fine hairs of nearly equal length.\n\nThe Lingula unguis is the only known species, the structure of which has been developed by Cuvier.\n\nGenus, Terebratula.\u2014Valves unequal, the peduncle passing through an aperture in the largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a>.\n\nThe arms are shorter than those of the Lingula, and are said to be forked. They are supported within by numerous arcuated plates.\n\nM. Lamarck divides the recent kinds into two sections. 1. Shell smooth, or destitute of longitudinal ribs. The T. cranium, a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZETLAND\">Zetland</a> seas, may be quoted as an example. The peduncle is simple. 2. Shell ribbed longitudinally. The T. aurita, which inhabits Loch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROOM\">Broom</a>, is another, though recently discovered, British example. The larger valve is broadest in the middle, semicircular in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, and narrowing towards the apex, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the sides being compressed or bent inwards. The ribs from the beak towards the anterior margin are the most distinct, rounded, and about eight in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; those towards the sides are obsolete. The under valve is nearly orbicular, with the margin at the hinge truncated, or rather obtusely angular, and having the sides depressed, and forming small auricles, as in the genus Pecten, but not produced. The ribs are obsoletely wrinkled across, and the margin is waved by the ribs being concave internally. The inner surface of both valves, especially the largest, is finely punctuated. The hinge is formed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> on each side, the proximal margin of the perforation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> valve entering corresponding depressions in the smaller one. The margin of the perforation itself is completed by the application of the smaller valve. The peduncle is short, and consists of numerous un-\n\nequal-sized tubular threads, attached by a complicated tendino-muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, chiefly to the larger valve. The spiral arms seemed to have simple summits, and to be destitute of testaceous plates. The smallness and probable youth of the subject, however, rendered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the structure impracticable. Trawled up in Loch Broom, near the harbour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STORNOWAY\">Stornoway</a>, 16th August 1821. This species approaches nearest to the T. truncata.\n\nThe fossil species of this genus are numerous, and occur in the older and newer of the floezy formations. They furnish obvious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of many genera, some of which have been already established.\n\n2. Subdivision.\n\nShell sessile.\n\nGenus, Criopas.\u2014Under valve cemented to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\n\nThe under valve is membranaceous, flat, and adhering; the upper is flatly conical, and resembles a patella, in which genus, from neglecting the structure of the animal, it has usually been placed.\n\nThe C. anomalus, Patella anomala of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a>, Zool. Dan. Tab. v. t. 1, 8, has a branched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> ovarium, with round eggs. It has been described and figured as a native of the Zetland seas, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Patella distorta, in Edin. Encyclopaedia, Vol. VII. p. 65, Tab. cciv.f. 4; and Lin. Trans. Vol. XI. p. 195, Tab. xiii. f. 5.\n\nII. Order.\n\nBivalvia.\n\nMouth destitute of fringed spiral arms.\n\nThe animals of this group form the class Coachi-fera of Lamarck, the Bivalvia of the older naturalists.\n\nThe shells exhibit great variety of form and relative size. They are joined together at the hinge, which is either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> or toothed, and corresponds in position with the back of the animal. The connection of the two valves is secured by the intervention of an elastic horny ligament, the office of which is to keep the valves open. It is either external or internal. The valves are closed by means of adductor muscles, intermixed with tendons, and, passing transversely through the animal, adhere to the corresponding places in the inside of each shell. By the contractions of these muscles the free edges of the valves are brought into contact, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the ligament is compressed or stretched, according as it is internal or external. The number of muscular impressions is employed by Lamarck in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the Bivalvia into two orders, Dimyaires and Monomyaires. This distinction, however, he has not attended to with care, as in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> Myllac\u00e9es, which he includes in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> order, or those having one adductor muscle, there are obviously two adductor muscles, although the one is certainly much larger and more complicated than the other. Besides these impressions of the adductor muscles, there are others connected with the foot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BYSSUS\">byssus</a>. The cloak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> the inside of the shells. In some cases it is entirely open, when the border corresponding with the free margin of the shell is thickened, and more or less fringed with contractile irritable filaments. In other cases the cloak in front is more or less united, and\nLocomotion is denied to many species of this order. Among these some are immovably cemented to rocks and stones, as oysters; a few are attached by a cartilaginous ligament, as the Anomia; while others are fixed by means of a byssus. This last organ consists of numerous filaments issuing from a complicated apparatus in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, connected with a secreting gland and with the shell by the intervention of tendinous bands. The foot is seated a little towards the mouth, is usually tongue-shaped, capable of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a>, with a furrow on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> surface. This organ, where a byssus is present, is considered as employed in opening and fixing the threads. When there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> byssus, it either acts as a sucker, enabling the animal to crawl among the surface of bodies, or as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PAW\">paw</a>, to dig holes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or mud. None of the species can float in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. They either crawl or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a>, the last kind of motion being effected by suddenly opening and shutting the valves. In securing a residence, some of the species bore into different substances by means of a rotatory motion of the shell. It was at one time supposed that the dwelling was formed by a secretion affecting the solution of the surrounding substance. But the very different substances penetrated by the same species, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, slate-clay, and wood, forbid us to entertain such a supposition.\n\nThe nervous system is here but little developed. The superior and inferior ganglia, surrounding the gullet, give rise to all the nervous filaments which proceed through the body.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs are scarcely less simple. The food is soft and swallowed entire, and either brought to the mouth by accident, or by eddies produced in the water, by the opening and shutting of the shells, aided in some cases by the syphons.\n\nIt may be proper here to state, in order to understand the relative situation of the parts, that, upon laying the animal upon its back, and opening the cloak, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a> appears to occupy the middle longitudinally, and the branchia to be arranged on each side. The mouth is situated at the anterior extremity, and consists of a simple aperture entering into the gullet, or rather stomach. It is surrounded by four flattened moveable tentacula, two of which in some are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> united with the cloak, while in others they are free to the base. In their structure they resemble the branchia. The stomach is full of cells, the bottom of each pierced with a biliary duct. A singular organ, termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, cylindrical, cartilaginous, and transparent, is found in some species projecting into the cavity of the stomach. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> is large, surrounds the stomach, and pours out its contents by numerous openings. The intestine terminates posteriorly by a tubular anus.\n\nThe branchia consist of two ribbands on each side, extending the length of the body, free on the sides and margin, and striated transversely. These plates are frequently of unequal size. The blood is brought to these by means of pulmonic veins, without the intervention of the heart. The aerated blood is transmitted to a systemic heart, consisting of one or two auricles, and a ventricle.\n\nThe reproductive organs of the Bivalvia, hitherto examined, consist of an ovarium occupying the sides of the body, and penetrating the membranes of the cloak. They appear to have the organs of both sexes incorporated, and to propagate without intercourse. Lamarck is disposed to consider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> fluid dispersed through the water; a supposition unsupported even by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMAL_KINGDOM\">animal <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Many species are ovoviviparous; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the eggs when ripe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into the gills, where they are hatched.\n\nThe methodical distribution of the Bivalvia appears to be attended with peculiar difficulties, in consequence of the uniformity which prevails in the structure and disposition of their organs. The characters furnished by the shell, though useful in the construction of generic as well as specific distinctions, have been abandoned by those who prefer a knowledge of the structure, rather than the form of an animal. The characters derived from the presence of a byssus, a foot, or syphons, appear to be nearly of co-ordinate importance. M. Cuvier gives the preference to those founded on the appearances of the latter, and distributes the genera into five families, an arrangement which we here propose to follow. These, however, may be considered as occupying a much higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, and each as including numerous families.\n\n1. Subdivision.\nCloak open.\n\nThere are no syphons, the anterior margin of the cloak being as open as the mouth of the shell. When the valves open, the water comes immediately in contact with the branchia and mouth. The margin of the mantle has a double fringe of filaments.\n\n1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">Tribe</a>.\n\nValves closed by one adductor muscle.\n\nA. Pectenidae. Animals free or fixed only by a byssus. Furnished with a foot.\n\nInto this family, contemplated by Lamarck, the following ill assorted genera may be placed: Pecten, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, Pedum, Plicatula, Vulsella, Placuna, Gryphaea, Perna, and Crenatula.\n\nB. Ostreidea. Shell cemented to foreign bodies. Body destitute of a foot.\n\nTo this family the following genera are related: Ostrea, Spondylus, and Anomia. The last genus ought to form a family apart.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nShell closed by two adductor muscles.\n\nThe two genera, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-AVICULA\">Avicula</a> and Meleagrina (of Lamarck), form one family of this tribe; the genus Pinna another; and the Arcad\u00e6 a third, including <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCA\">Arca</a>, Pectunculus, Nucula, Cucull\u00e6a, Trigonia, and Castalia.\n\n2. Subdivision.\n\nCloak more or less closed, forming syphons.\n\nThe further division of this group depends on the modifications of the syphons, or aperture of the cloak.\n\n1. Tribe.\n\nThe union of the cloak forming only one syphon. This is situate posteriorly opposite the anus, and serves for the purpose of the excrements. The other\nlarge opening allows the water to enter to the mouth and gills.\n\nThis tribe may be divided into two families. The first, *Mytilusidae*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> include the genera Mytilus, Modiolus, and Lithodomus, which are furnished with a byssus. The second, *Unioidea*, will embrace Unio, Ilyria, Anodonta, and Iridina. They want a byssus.\n\nM. Cuvier is disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in this group the genera Cardita, Venericardia, and Crassatella.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nCloak closed posteriorly, and anteriorly forming three apertures. The first serves for the passage of the byssus, and is the largest. The second admits water to the branchiae and mouth; and the third is opposite the anus. The valves are closed by one adductor muscle. There are only two genera belonging to this tribe, Tridacna and Hippopus.\n\nIn the two remaining tribes there are three openings in the cloak. Two of these are posterior, and near each other; sometimes, indeed, they are tubular and united. There is no byssus, but always a foot.\n\n3. Tribe.\n\nAnterior opening large, allowing the water free access to the mouth and gills, and the feet freedom of motion. The structure of the animals is yet too imperfectly examined, to enable any one to establish families on permanent characters. The attempt which Lamarck has made may be considered as a complete failure, independent of the wanton changes of nomenclature with which it is chargeable. The following are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> genera belonging to this tribe: Chama, Isocardia, Cardium, Donax, Cyclas, Corbis, Tellina, Lorpes, Lucina, Venus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPSA\">Capsa</a>, Petricola, Corbula, and Mactra.\n\n4. Tribe.\n\nAnterior opening small, and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the mouth or gills.\n\nIn this tribe the mantle is closed in front; and even when the valves are open, neither mouth nor gills are visible. The anterior opening serves for a passage to the foot, and the posterior openings, in the form of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> tubes, united by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> membrane, serve for the entrance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> of the water to the mouth and branchiae, and the ejection of the feces, the dorsal siphon serving the latter purpose. The cuticle of the shell covers also the exposed portion of the cloak, so that, when the animal is removed from the shell, it remains as a loose membrane on the margin of the valves, as was first observed by Reaumur. All the genera prefer concealment, burrowing in sand, mud, or wood, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> downwards, and the siphons rising to the surface. The following genera belong to this tribe: Mya, Lutraria, Anatina, Glycemeris, Panopea, Pandora, Gastrochena, Byssomia, Hiatella, Solen, Sanguinolaria, Pholas, Teredo, and Fistularia.\n\nII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a>.","sp":888,"ep":891},{"h":"ACEPHALA TUNICATA","t":"Covering soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> coriaceous:\n\nThe formation of this interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of animals was first publicly announced by Lamarck in his *Histoire Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertebres*, Tom. III. p. 80 (1816). The labours of Desmaret, Lesueur, and Cuvier, aided by the descriptions of Ellis and Pallas, paved the way for the masterly efforts of Savigny, to whom we owe the most extensive, new, and accurate information yet given concerning the animals of this group. His observations are contained in his *Recherches Anatomiques sur les Ascidies compos\u00e9es, et sur les Ascidies simples*, inserted in his *Memoires sur les Animaux sans Vertebres*. 8vo. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1816.\n\nThe covering of the animals of this group consists of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal sac or tunic, which are either entirely united or unconnected, except at the apertures. The surface is smooth in some, and rough in others, and in a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> defended by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> covering of agglutinated shells and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. The sacs are furnished with muscular bands, and are capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>. Some of the species, by means of contractile movements, float about in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; others, receiving that element into the branchial cavity, and ejecting it forcibly at the opposite one, push themselves forward. Many, however, are fixed during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to seaweeds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\n\nThe apertures of the tunic are two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, unless in the doubtful genus Mammaria. The one, frequently the largest, is destined for receiving the water into the cavity to supply the mouth and gills. This is termed the branchial cavity. The other is destined for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> of the water, the eggs, and the feces, and termed the anal opening. These apertures are sometimes placed near each other, at other times at opposite extremities of the body, and variously provided with tentacula or valves.\n\nThe mouth is simple, destitute of spiral arms, and opening in the interior of the cavity of the body between the branchiae, as in the other Acephala. It possesses neither jaws nor tentacula. The alimentary canal is very simple, and can scarcely be distinguished into gullet, stomach, and intestine. The food is soft, and such as the bounty of the waves bestows. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> adheres to the stomach, and in many species is divided into distinct lobes.\n\nThe circulating system appears to be reduced to a single systemic ventricle. The gills cover the walls of the cavity, in the form of ridges, more or less complicated, and seldom symmetrical.\n\nThe reproductive organs consist of an ovarium, either simple or complicated, with some additional glands, the uses of which have not been ascertained. They are considered as hermaphrodite, and independent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>. They appear not only to be oviparous, but to be gemmiparous and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, many individuals being organically connected, and capable of simultaneous movements. They are all inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\n1. Subdivision.\n\nInterior tunic detached from the external one, and united only at the two orifices.\n\nThe branchiae are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, equal, and spread on the central walls of the inner sac. The branchial orifice has an inner membranaceous denticulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, or a circle of tentacula.\nBody permanently fixed to other bodies.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> the branchial and anal orifices are not opposite each other, and do not communicate through the branchial cavity. This cavity at its opening is furnished with tentacular filaments. The branchiae are conjoined anteriorly.\n\nA. Simple.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> includes the genus *Ascidia* of Linnaeus. The individuals are independent of each other, and although they frequently adhere together in clusters, they are destitute of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> covering, or organic connection.\n\n1. Apertures furnished with four rays.\n\nThe animals of this group have the external tunic coriaceous, dry, opaque, rough, folded, and frequently covered with extraneous bodies, or inclosing such. The branchial orifice has four rays, the anal one the same, or divided transversely. The branchiae are divided longitudinally into persistent regular deep folds.\n\na. Body pedunculated.\n\nThe peduncle, in this division, may be said to have its rise in the summit of the body, which it serves to suspend. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a> is lateral. The meshes of the branchiae are destitute of papillae.\n\nGenus, *Boltenia.*\u2014The tentacular filaments of the branchial circle are compound. There is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> liver, and the ovarium is compound. Only one species is known, *B. fusiforme.* Savigny, Mem. Tab. i. f. 1. and Tab. v. f. 5. It is the *Vorticella Bolteni* of Lin., and the *Ascidia clavata* of Shaw.\n\nb. Body sessile.\n\nM. Savigny describes this group as a genus, which he terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CYNTHIA\">Cynthia</a>, which he divides into four subgenera.\n\n(A.) Tentacular filaments of the branchial orifice compound. The folds of the branchiae more than eight in number. The liver distinct, and surrounding the stomach. Ovarium divided, with one division at least on each side the body. The intestine destitute of a rib.\n\nGenus, *Cynthia.*\u2014Meshes of the branchiae unchanged by the folds. *C. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOMUS\">Momus</a>.* Sav. Tab. i. f. 2.\n\nGenus, *Cexira.*\u2014Meshes of the branchiae interrupted by the folds. *C. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a>* of Sav. Tab. vii. f. 1. The *Ascidia quadridentata* of Forskael.\n\n(B.) Tentacular filaments of the branchial orifice simple. The folds of the branchiae eight in number, four on each side, and the meshes uninterrupted. Intestine strengthened by a cylindrical rib from the pylorus to the anus. Liver absent or indistinct.\n\nGenus, *Styela.*\u2014Ovarium divided, one division at least on each side. *S. Canopus.* Sav. Tab. viii. f. 1.\n\nGenus, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PANDOCIA\">Pandocia</a>.*\u2014Ovarium single, and situate in the fold of the intestine. The *Ascidia conchilega,* a native species, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a>.\n\n2. Apertures with indistinct rays, or more than four.\n\nThe external tunic is here soft, easily cut, and translucent. The rays (when existing) of the branchial orifice amount to eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>; and those of the anal to six at least. The branchiae are destitute of longitudinal folds. The tentacular filaments of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">Mollusca</a>,* the branchial circle are simple. Liver indistinct. Ovarium single.\n\na. Body pedunculated.\n\nThe stalk is here placed at the base, and serves to support the body, being of an opposite character from that of the Boltenia.\n\nGenus, *Clavelina.*\u2014Branchial and anal orifices without rays. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">Angles</a> of the branchial meshes simple. Intestine destitute of a rib. The *Ascidia clavata* of Pallas, and the *A. lepadiformis* of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a>, belong to this genus; the latter of these is now recorded as a British species.\n\nb. Body sessile.\n\nThe branchial orifice with eight or nine rays, and the anal with six. The angles of the branchial meshes with papillae. No liver. A cylindrical rib extending from the pylorus to the anus.\n\n(A.) Tunic and branchial cavity straight.\n\nGenus, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PIRENA\">Pirena</a>.*\u2014The branchial sac as extended as the tunic. Stomach not resting on the intestine. *P. phusca* of Forskael is the type, to which Savigny has added three other species. The *Ascidia prunum* of Muller, a native species, is probably of this genus.\n\nGenus, *Ciona.*\u2014Branchial sac shorter than the tunic, and exceeded by the viscera. *C. Ascidia intestinialis,* Lin. is a native example of this genus.\n\n(B.) Tunic turned up at the base.\n\nGenus, *Phallusia.*\u2014Branchial sac extending beyond the viscera into the pouch of the sac. Stomach resting on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of viscera. The *Ascidia mentula* of Muller, a native species, is the type.\n\nThere are two genera supposed to be nearly related to the preceding, which are involved in great obscurity. The genus *Bipapilaria* of Lamarck appears to be pedunculated, with two apertures, each furnished with three setaceous tentacula. The *Mammaria* of Muller has only one terminal aperture. One species inhabits the British seas.\n\nB. Compound.\n\nThe animals included under this division were formerly included in the genus *Alcyonium* of Linnaeus, and placed among the Zoophytes. They are compound animals, many individuals united by a common integument, and arranged according to a uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>.\n\nIn some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, there is only one system of individuals in the mass, in other cases, there are many, similarly arranged and contiguous. The tentacular filaments of the branchiae appear to be distinct. They are destitute of the intestinal rib which occurs in some of the preceding genera.\n\n1. Branchial Orifice Radiated.\n\na. Branchial and anal orifices, with six rays.\n\n(A.) Body sessile. The angles of the branchial meshes furnished with papillae. The thorax, or cavity containing the branchiae, cylindrical. The abdomen is inferior, with a stalk. Ovarium sessile, and single.\n\nGenus, *Diazona.*\u2014Body orbicular, with a single system of animals disposed in concentric circles. The substance is gelatinous. The ovarium en-\nclosed in the fold of the intestine. *D. violacea* of Sav. Tab. ii. f. 3.\n\nGenus, *Polyzona.*\u2014Body polymorphous, with many systems disposed subcircularly.\n\nThe body is subartilaginous. The individuals are disposed irregularly around the common centre. Savigny inadvertently termed this genus Distoma, a name <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> preoccupied among the Intestina. The *Alcyonium rubrum* of Plancus, and the *Distomus variolosus* of Gaertner, belong to this genus. The last is a native species.\n\n(B.) Body pedunculated.\n\nGenus, *Sigillina.*\u2014Body a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> cone, consisting of a single system of many individuals, irregularly disposed, one above the other.\n\nThe thorax is short, and hemispherical. The angles of the branchial meshes destitute of papillae. The abdomen is inferior, sessile, and larger than the thorax. The single ovarium is pedunculated. *S. australis*, Sav. Tab. iii. f. 2. brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, by M. Peron, is the only known species.\n\nb. Branchial orifice only furnished with six rays.\n\n(A.) Body pedunculated. System single, circular, and terminal.\n\nGenus, *Synoicum.*\u2014Anal orifice rayed.\n\nThe body is cylindrical. The anal orifice has six very unequal rays; the three largest forming the exterior margin of the central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>. The stomach is simple. The angles of the branchial meshes destitute of papillae. Ovarium single, sessile attached to the bottom of the abdomen, and descending perpendicularly. The *S. turgens* of Phipps is the type. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of August 1817, we observed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of May another species, adhering to a rock, and differing from the *turgens* chiefly in the smoothness of its skin.\n\nGenus, *Sydneum.*\u2014Anal orifice simple and tubular.\n\nThe body is inversely conical. The stomach surrounded with glands. Intestine spirally folded. Ovarium pedunculated. The *S. turbinatum* is the only known species, and was sent to Savigny by Leach from the British seas.\n\n(B.) Body sessile, polymorphous.\n\n(a.) Each system with a central cavity.\n\nGenus, *Polyclinum.*\u2014Systems numerous, convex stellar. Individuals arranged irregularly round the common centre. Abdomen inferior pedunculated, and less than the thorax. Ovarium single, pedunculated, and attached to the side of the abdominal cavity, and drooping.\n\nM. Savigny describes one species from the Mauritius, and five from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEZ\">Suez</a>.\n\n(b.) Systems destitute of central cavity, and the angles of the branchial meshes without papillae.\n\nGenus, *Alpidium.*\u2014Individuals in a single row round the common centre.\n\nThe thorax is cylindrical. The abdomen inferior sessile, and of the size of the thorax. Ovarium single, sessile, placed at the bottom of the abdomen, and prolonged perpendicularly. Savigny divides the genus into two tribes. In the first, the individuals are simply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, with an ovarium shorter than the body, as *A. ficus* (*Alcyonium ficus*, Linn.). In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, the individuals are filiform, with an ovarium longer than the body, as *A. effusum* of Savigny, Tab. xvi. f. 3.\n\nGenus, *Didemnum.*\u2014Individuals in indistinct systems.\n\nThe thorax is short and subglobular. The abdomen inferior, pedunculated, and larger than the thorax. The anal opening is obscure. The ovarium is single, sessile, and placed on the side of the abdomen. *D. candidum* and *viscosum*, from the Gulf of Suez, are the only known species.\n\n2. Branchial Orifice simple.\n\nThe species form a thin fleshy crust on stones and sea-weeds. The individuals are stellarly arranged in distinct systems. The branchial orifice is circular and undivided. The abdomen is sublateral, and fixed at the bottom of the branchial cavity. The intestine is small, and the anus indistinct. The angles of the branchial meshes are without papillae.\n\nGenus, *Botryllus.*\u2014Systems furnished with a central cavity.\n\nThe systems are prominent, and consist of one or more regular concentric rows. The ovarium is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, being attached to each side of the branchial sac.\n\nThis genus is subdivided by Savigny into *Botrylli stellati*, and *Botrylli conglomerati*. In the first, where the individuals are distributed in a single row, there are some species in which the individuals are cylindrical with approaching orifices, and the limb of the central cavity not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> and probably short, as the *B. rosaceus* Leachii and *Borlasii*. In other species, the individuals are ovoid, with remote orifices, and the limb of the central cavity is always apparent and notched, as *B. Schlosseri*, *stelatus*, *genmerus*, and *minutus*. In the Botrylli conglomerati, in which the individuals are disposed in several rows, there is only one species, *B. conglomeratus*.\n\nGenus, *Eucelium.*\u2014Systems destitute of a central cavity.\n\nThe individuals are distributed in a single row, and the ovarium is single, sessile, and attached to the side of the abdominal cavity. The *E. hospitilium* of Sav. Tab. iv. f. 4, is the only known species.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nBody free, and moving about in the water.\n\nGenus, *Pyrosoma.*\n\nThe body is gelatinous, in the form of a lengthened bag open at the widest end. The individuals are arranged perpendicularly to the axis of the central cavity, super-imposed on one another. The branchial orifice is external, without rays, and with an appendage over its upper margin. The anal orifice is opposite, and terminates in the central cavity. Branchial sac destitute of folds, with a membranaceous ring at the entry. The branchiae are disjoined. The abdomen is inferior to the branchiae, and not separated by any contraction. Liver distinct, globular, and retained in a fold of the intestine. Ovarium double, opposite, and situate at the upper extremity of the branchial cavity.\n\nM. Savigny divides the species into *Pyrosomata*\nverticilla, having the individuals arranged in regular prominent rings, as *P. elegans* of Lesueur; and *Pyrosomata paniculata*, having the individuals forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> circles unequally prominent, as *P. giganteum* and *Atlanticum*.\n\n2. Subdivision.\n\nInner tunic adhering throughout to the external one.\n\nThe body is gelatinous, transparent, and simple. The branchial cavity is open at both ends, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> freely with the anus. The branchial orifice is in the form of a transverse slit, with one edge in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a>, to accelerate the entrance of the water into the cavity. The inner tunic is strengthened by numerous transverse muscular bands, which, by contracting, diminish the diameter of the cavity, and eject the water from the anal orifice, thereby propelling the body through the water. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs are situate at the inner end of the cavity. The mouth and rectum are simple; the former placed between the two branchiae, the latter directed towards the anal orifice. The heart is contiguous to the stomach, at the bottom of what may be termed the branchial sac, and is enveloped in a membranaceous pericardium. The branchiae are double, not incorporated with the walls of the sac, but with two folds of unequal length. The largest is free in the middle, fixed at each extremity, and opposed to the dorsal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, and traverses the cavity obliquely. The other extends from the base of the first to the extremity of the dorsal groove. The surface of the branchiae consists of transverse vessels in a single range in some species, and a double range in others.\n\nWhen young, many individuals often adhere, and form chains and circles. But the fully grown individuals are always detached and single.\n\nThis subdivision comprehends the species of the genus Salpa; they are exceedingly numerous, and appear to belong to many different genera. M. Cuvier has given indications of some of these, chiefly derived from the shape. A few are furnished with an elevated crest or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THALIA\">Thalia</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>; a few have both extremities rounded or truncated, as *Salpa octofera* of Cuvier; others have one extremity produced, as *Holothuria zonaria* of Gmelin; and even both extremities produced, as *Salpa maxima* of Forskael. The *Salpa moniliformis*, so common in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a>, and first recorded as a native by Dr Macculloch, in his valuable *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of the Western Isles*, Vol. II. p. 188, and imperfectly figured in its young state, at Tab. xxix. fig. 2, appears to be closely allied to the *S. maxima* of Forskael, and but very remotely with the *S. polycreatica* and *confederata* with which it is compared. This observer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that \"It cannot bear to be confined in a limited portion of water, as it died even in a ship's bucket in less than half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>.\" With us, in similar circumstances, those taken in the evening were alive at noon on the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of molluscous animals for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> is attended with peculiar difficulty. The shells, indeed, need only to be cleaned with a soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> kinds to be steeped in fresh water to extract all the saline ingredients, and dried, when they are fit for the cabinet. The soft parts, however, can seldom be distended by any substance, and dried. They are usually, therefore, preserved in spirits of wine, where but too frequently they appear a shapeless mass.

Among the vertebral animals, the brain is collected into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> at the anterior extremity of the body, and sends out a nervous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, termed the spinal marrow, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> extremity. These nervous portions are protected by a cranium and vertebral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>.\n\nThe invertebral animals occupy a lower station than those belonging to the vertebral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>. Their nervous system, in particular, is less fully developed, and their organs of perception are greatly reduced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. They may be distinguished readily by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> character:\n\nInvertebrata.\n\nInvertebratal Animals.\n\nAnimals destitute of a Skull and Vertebral Column for the Protection of the Brain and Spinal Marrow.\n\nThe invertebratal animals have few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of a positive kind, which they possess in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>. The skin, in general, consists only of a corium and cuticle, both of which, according to circumstances, are furnished with appendices, in the form of shells, crusts, scales, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> hairs. These, in general, supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the osseous system, serving as a protection to the viscera, and as supports to the muscles. The blood, in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where a circulating fluid can be detected, is usually of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or grey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, seldom inclining to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. When there are both systemic and pulmonic ventricles, they are not united as in the vertebral animals. With the exception of the genuine viviparous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>, the invertebratal animals exhibit all the other modifications of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>.\n\nIn attempting the division of invertebratal animals into subordinate groups, the condition of the nervous system furnishes characters of importance. In one extensive class, which, from their starry form, have been termed Radiata, the nervous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> appears to be disseminated among the different organs, and never appears in the form of a brain, with its connected filaments. In another class, equally extensive, and which, with propriety, may be denominated Gani gliata, the brain appears in the form of a collar, surrounding the gullet, near its entrance into the stomach, and sending out filaments, which, in their course, expand into ganglia. In this last group are included the classes Annulata and Mollusca. The classification of the Annulata animals has been already communicated to our readers. The Molluscan tribes now claim our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. The essential characters, by which these two classes may be distinguished, depend on the condition of the nervous filaments proceeding from the brain; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which, in the former, constitute a knotted cord proceeding to the extremity, while, in the latter, they separate irregularly.\n\n* See the word Mollusca, p. 490 of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">Volume</a>.\nIndependent of this internal character, molluscous animals are distinguished from those of the annulose division by the absence of articulated feet, or the cuticular processes which supply their place, and by the body not being divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> or rings.\n\nUnder the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol6.html#article-CONCHOLOGY\">Conchology</a>, a variety of details were given regarding the shells of molluscous animals, the characters furnished by these appendices of the skin which have been employed in their classification, the relative value of the different popular systems which have been proposed, together with some remarks on the physical distribution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and the revolutions which, in former ages, they have experienced. The present article may, therefore, be regarded as a continuation of the one dedicated to Conchology, and as having more immediately in view the exposition of those characters which are now employed in the most approved systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">zoology</a>.\n\nMolluscous animals divide themselves into two great divisions, which are distinguished from each other by well defined characters. In the first the presence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> may be recognised, together with eyes and even ears, in some of the groups. In the other, containing animals much less perfect in their organization, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> head, nor vestiges of eyes or ears in any of the groups. The former have been termed Mollusca cephalia, the latter Mollusca acephalia. This arrangement was first employed by the celebrated M. Cuvier, and afterwards by Lamarck and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> systematical writers. In the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the former naturalist, this method is departed from, and six orders are now constituted of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, instead of being placed subordinate to the two primary divisions, under which, notwithstanding, they can be suitably distributed.\n\nI. Division.","sp":876,"ep":878},{"h":"AGRICULTURE","t":"The Agriculture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> is, generally speaking, in a very backward state. With a few exceptions, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEATH\">Meath</a>, and some other well cultivated districts, the farmers are destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, and labour small crofts, which they hold of middlemen interposed between them and the landlord. The fact that the landlord never, in Ireland, lays out anything upon repairs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> buildings, coupled with the general inability of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> to do either in a substantial manner, is very significant as to the state of agriculture. (Tighe\u2019s Survey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILKENNY\">Kilkenny</a>, 412; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a>, I. 244.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> are generally of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> endurance; three lives or 31 years is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rate. But the worst features of the rural economy of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> are the entire want of capital in the farmers, and the complete indifference of the landlord to the character, wealth, or industry, of his tenant. \u201cCapital,\u201d says Mr Wakefield, \u201cis considered of so little importance in Ireland, that advertisements constantly appear in the newspapers, in which it is stated, that the preference <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> certainly be given to the highest bidder. Bargains are constantly made with a beggar, as a new tenant, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he offers more rent, invariably turns out the old one, however industrious. Even if the unfortunate wretch has a little ready cash to begin with, it only serves, in 99 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> out of 100, as a temptation to the landlord, who, when the fact becomes known to him, finds means to obtain it under the name of a fine for possession.\u201d (Vol. I. p. 587.) Regard to present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>, without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the future, constitutes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the Irish landlord. (Ibid. I. 304.)\n\nThe rent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in Ireland from these causes, coupled with the excessive competition of the peasantry for small farms, as their only means of subsistence, has risen to a great height. (Townsend\u2019s Cork, 218; Wakefield, I. 582.)\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> exhibits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rent in the different counties, as they were taken by Mr Wakefield in 1810, distinguishing the rent for cultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> from that of the total area:\nAnd calculating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the green acres and total area at one-fourth (according to Mr Arrowsmith's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>), this will give L.1,7s. 1d. as the average rent of the total area of the island. This, upon 12,722,615 Irish acres, gives L.17,928,540, as the total rental of the island, in Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> (Wakefield, I. 305); or, upon 20,437,974 English acres, yields an average of about 17s. per English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>.\n\nThe capital laid out in the improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is extremely small when compared with that employed in the neighbouring kingdoms of England and Scotland. In 1799, Mr Young calculated that, converting Irish acres into English, it would require an outlay of L.5 an acre to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> Ireland on a footing with England in this respect. The whole amount, therefore, of the sum required would be L.88,341,136. (Young's Irish Tour, II. 9.) From the change in the value of money, Mr Wakefield has since calculated that the sum required to effect such a change would be L.120,000,000, independently altogether of the capital which the British agriculturist brings to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> in order to carry on the cultivation of the land. When it is considered how little capital is thus sunk in the Irish soil, and recollected that the average rent of England is only 20s. an acre, even under the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cultivation which is there pursued, it is obvious how much the proportion of the produce of the soil in Ireland, which goes to the landlord, has encroached on what should be left as a remuneration to the farmer. (Wakefield, I. 585.)\n\nThe price of land varies in different parts of Ireland. In the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>, and thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMAGH\">Armagh</a>, it brings thirty years' purchase; in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the island, it does not exceed twenty, and, in the richest districts, it may often be bought for sixteen or eighteen. The exposure of landed estates to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> takes place very seldom, which is perhaps one cause of their not bringing so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> a price as they would otherwise do. (Ibid. I. 307.)\n\nThe whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is classed by Mr Wakefield Agricultural into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> agricultural divisions, in each of which the mode of culture is somewhat different from what it is in the others. The first district comprehends the flat parts of Antrim; the eastern side of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRONE\">Tyrone</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">Down</a>, Armagh, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONAGHAN\">Monaghan</a>, and Cavan. Throughout this district, the farms are extremely small, and the land is generally dug with the spade. Potatoes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, and oats, are the crops usually cultivated, and these are grown till the land is exhausted, and suffered to \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at rest,\" as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, till its strength is recruited by the cow, the goat, two or three sheep, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> lying upon it, for some years. The ploughs used in this district are of the rudest structure, and perform their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in the most slovenly manner. Three or four neighbours unite their strength to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, every one bringing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, his bullock, or his cow. All the other operations of agriculture are performed in an equally slovenly manner. The little wheat that is raised is \"lashed,\" as they call it, that is, the grain is knocked out by striking the sheaf across a beam placed above a cloth, which, however, is afterwards thrashed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAIL\">flail</a>. This operation of thrashing usually takes place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIGHWAY\">highway</a>, and it is dressed by letting it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from a kind of sieve which, during a pretty strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, is held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> high by a woman. Many cottars in this district have a cabin with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> land attached to it. They hire an acre or two, for grass or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-POTATO\">potato</a> land, from some cottar in their vicinity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of hiring labourers is unknown, the neighbours all assisting each other in their more considerable occupations, such as sowing, reaping. The dwellings here are miserably small; often too small to contain the numerous families that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from their doors. Land is everywhere divided into the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> portions. (Wakefield, I. 363; Dubourdieu's Down, 39.)\n\nUnder the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> district may be comprised the northern part of Antrim, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDONDERRY\">Londonderry</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and west of Tyrone, and the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DONEGAL\">Donegal</a>. Agriculture here is in a worse state than in the preceding district. There is no clover, and hardly any wheat. Clover is unknown, and the only mill for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of grain is in Derry. (Ibid. I. 372.)\n\nThe third district comprehends the northern parts of Fermanagh. Here the farms are much larger than in the former, and the agricultural system pursued far superior. They plant potatoes on\nIreland: a lea, twice reversing the lands, and the course is flax, oats, and weeds. Some wheat is grown, but oats is still the prevalent crop. In the neighbourhood of Enniskillen, the farmers are so rich as to be able to eat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a> meat daily and drink wine. (Wakefield, I. 379.)\n\nThe fourth district comprehends <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLIGO\">Sligo</a>, Mayo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALWAY\">Galway</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a>, and parts of Roscommon, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGFORD\">Longford</a>. In some parts of this district the spade culture is pursued; but, in general, the land is cultivated by a plough drawn by four horses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a>. In Roscommon, the old custom of yoking the horses by the tail is still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, although, so early as 1634, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> was passed against this absurd practice. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Ormonde, I. 79.) Oats are chiefly raised in this district, and, along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, barley is cultivated. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of the rent depends on the illegal distilleries, and much of the district is let on lease to several persons jointly, according to the village system. (Wakefield, I. 381.)\n\nIn the fifth district, which comprehends <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMERICK\">Limerick</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KERRY\">Kerry</a>, the south side and northern part of Cork, and the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATERFORD\">Waterford</a>, cultivation is in a very rude state; little corn is grown here, with the exception of the southern part of Cork. Land is extremely divided, and the farms very small. The greater part is a grazing country. (Ibid. I. 387.)\n\nThe sixth district includes the southern parts of Cork. The spade culture is here almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, and the farms unusually small. Hogs constitute the main support of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. (Townsend's Cork, 194.)\n\nThe seventh district includes part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIPPERARY\">Tipperary</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-QUEEN_S_COUNTY\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s County and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s County. The best farming in Ireland is observable in this district; a systematic course of husbandry being pursued, by which the land is kept in good heart. Oxen and horses are used in the plough, and hedge-rows and good wheat fallows are to be seen. Near Rosseria the cultivation of turnips is followed, and they succeed well. Ninety acres is considered a large farm. Leases are generally for three lives. (Wakefield, I. 398.)\n\nThe eighth district comprises <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEXFORD\">Wexford</a> and a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICKLOW\">Wicklow</a>. Beans are here sometimes introduced into cultivation, but they are sown broadcast, and never hoed. The mode of ploughing is very awkward; one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> holds the plough, another leads the horse, and a third sits on it to keep it down. Notwithstanding this rude culture, however, the rents are enormous. (Ibid. I. 407.)\n\nThe ninth district comprehends the northern part of Kilkenny, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILDARE\">Kildare</a>, the cultivated parts of West Meath, Meath, and Lowth. Wheat here enters into the system of culture, but the preparatory fallows are very bad. Clover has been introduced into the district, but under the bad system of sowing it upon land exhausted, and covered by weeds. Farms are large, and the mode of culture similar to what is pursued in England, though the details are executed in a much more slovenly manner. (Ibid. I. 413.)\n\nThe following table exhibits, at one view, the produce of these different districts, according to the mode of cultivation at present adopted. The seed and produce is given in pounds Avoirdupois:\n\n| DISTRICTS | WHEAT | BARLEY | OATS | POTATOES | FLAX |\n|-----------|-------|--------|------|----------|------|\n|           | Seed  | Prod.  | Seed | Prod.    | Seed | Prod. |\n| 1         | 224   | 2274   | 203  | 3500     | 209  | 2982  |\n| 2         | 175   | 2133   |      |          | 203  | 2646  |\n| 3         |       |        |      |          | 291  | 3227  |\n| 4         | 222   | 2024   | 196  | 3584     | 244  | 2765  |\n| 5         | 243   | 2537   | 261  | 4480     | 249  | 3024  |\n| 6         |       |        |      |          | 298  | 2970  |\n| 7         | 292   | 1857   | 187  | 3131     | 173  | 2828  |\n| 8         | 186   | 2353   |      |          | 296  | 2614  |\n| 9         | 257   | 2553   | 211  | 3494     | 246  | 3235  |\n\nAverage in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> bush. to Irish acres, 3.38 33.6 4.01 69.2 4.4 54.6 8.4 72.4\n\nTo English acres, 2.086 20.74 2.47 24.7 2.71 33.7 5.18 44.5\n\nGeneral Observations: The implements of husbandry used in Ireland are all of the rudest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>. The plough, the spade, the flail, the carr, all equally partake of imperfections and defects. The fallows are not well attended to; three ploughings are usually deemed sufficient, and, from the imperfection of the plough, the ground at the end is generally full of weeds. Trenching land is very general; they form it into beds, and shovel out a deep trench between them, throwing up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The expense of this operation is about 8s. an acre. Wheat, as will be seen from the preceding details, is not by any means generally cultivated. It is unknown in Monaghan, Tyrone, Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITRIM\">Leitrim</a>, and Cavan, though it is grown to a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> in Kilkenny, Carlow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, Meath, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUTH\">Louth</a>, and parts of Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, and Cork. It is generally sown after potatoes or fallow. The Irish wheat is, for the most part, coarse and of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and does not yield so much saccha-\nIreland\n\nBarley is more generally cultivated than wheat, and it is generally sown after potatoes. Oats, however, constitute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of grain most extensively raised; it is calculated, that throughout the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, there are ten acres of oats sown for one of any other species of corn. The Irish oats, however, are decidedly inferior to the English. The potatoes of Ireland have long been celebrated, both on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and excellent qualities. They are cultivated on every species of soil, either in drills or lazy beds. Potatoe land lets from L. 6, 6s. to L. 10, 10s. per acre; and the expense of culture, including rent, varies from L. 13 to L. 16 per acre. The produce is from 800 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> to 1000 stone the acre, at twenty-one pounds to the stone; that is, from 16,800 to 21,000 pounds. (Ibid. I. 450.)\n\nThe indigenous grasses of Ireland are not of any peculiar excellence. Notwithstanding all that has been said of the fioria grass, its excellence and utility may be called in question. Their hay is seldom from seed, generally consisting of the spontaneous produce of the soil. Clover is almost unknown. Mr Newenham calculates that there are not 5000 acres under this crop in the whole island. (Newenham, 314; Wakefield, I. 467.) There are few living hedges in Ireland; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> stone districts, stone walls, and, in other places, turf-banks are the usual fences.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> is the most extensive and the best managed part of Irish husbandry. Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Carlow, Meath, West Meath, Longford, and Fermanagh, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Leitrim and Sligo, are principally occupied by dairy farms. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">Butter</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> produce. The average <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cows on a dairy farm is thirty or forty; three acres of land, of middling quality, are deemed necessary for the subsistence of each cow. The average produce of a cow is eight quarts in twenty-four hours in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and five in winter; four good milkers will yield half a cwt. of butter in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. The best butter is made in Carlow; the worst in Limerick and Meath. Generally speaking, the Irish are very clean in making this article, and it is exported to England, the East and West Indies, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>. (Wakefield, I. 325, et seq.)\n\nThe grazing of Ireland is not, as in England, a part of the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of crops, but is carried on in a country exclusively devoted to the breeding of cattle like the Highlands of Scotland. Great tracts of the country also are devoted to the grazing of sheep. Roscommon, Galway, Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary, are the chief breeding countries for sheep; and Galway, Clare, Roscommon, Tipperary, and Meath, are the places where they are fattened. The sheep are of the long-wooled kind, and very large; they are never kept in sheep-folds, and hardly ever fed on turnips; which is chiefly owing to the very limited demand for mutton among the labouring people. (Ibid. I. 341.)\n\nThe Agricultural Exports of Ireland have increased at a very rapid rate within the last forty years, owing chiefly to the great demand and near vicinity of England.\u2014We have given a view of the Irish exports of oats and oatmeal, wheat and wheat flour, and of all other kinds of grain, in the tables contained in our article on the CORN LAWS AND TRADE, particularly table eleventh, to which we beg to refer the reader.\n\nThe export of butter to England and Scotland has, of late years, been very great.\n\n| Year ending | England | Scotland | Total |\n|-------------|---------|----------|-------|\n| 5th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1814 | 335,761 | 16,071 | 351,832 |\n| 1815 | 334,856 | 16,819 | 351,675 |\n| 1816 | 316,209 | 21,169 | 337,378 |\n| 1817 | 286,678 | 17,236 | 303,964 |\n\nTo foreign parts, in 1814, 109,682\n1815, 80,479\n1816, 90,815\n1817, 87,154\n\nOf these, upwards of 50,000 cwts. were annually exported to Portugal.\n\nThe export of beef and pork has increased in the same striking manner.\n\nExports of Beef, on an average of five years, ending 1782, 172,690\n1790, 138,016\n1795, 128,598\nOf eight years, ending 1796, 123,877\n1803, 112,059\nYear 1804, 79,347\n\nPork Exported from Ireland.\n\n| Pork, Barrels | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, Flitches | Hams, Cwt. | Hogs |\n|---------------|----------------|------------|------|\n| On an average of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> years, ending | 1770 | 41,649 | 7,881 | 223 |\n| 1777 | 55,240 | 19,125 | 624 |\n| Five years, ending | 1782 | 87,085 | 5,983 | 317 |\n| Seven years, ending | 1792 | 94,079 | 41,418 | 945 |\n| Year | 1796 | 114,844 | 70,144 |\n| Year 1802 to Jan. 5 | 1805 | 117,676 | 90,772 |\n| Year | 1804 | 119,049 | 114,382 | 39,55 |\n\nTo these tables we shall subjoin a statement of the agricultural exports of Ireland to Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, during the year 1819, which shows equally its progressive increase and the invaluable importance of the British market to Irish industry.\n\nExports of Ireland to Great Britain during the year 1819.\n\n| Oats, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">Quarters</a> | Wheat, do. | Barley, do. | Beans, Quarters |\n|----------------|------------|-------------|----------------|\n| 759,608        | 127,308    | 20,290      | 3,903          |\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of Ireland are now very considerable, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture. This great and staple branch of Irish industry was established by the Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORMOND\">Ormond</a>, in 1669; and, in the beginning of the following century, Parliament took it under its protection, and voted considerable sums of money for its support. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, a Board was established, which has since exerted itself most vigorously for its encouragement. It enhances the value of this manufacture to the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, that the raw material of which it is composed is raised almost entirely within the island. It would appear that the number of acres under flax in 1810 was little short of 100,000, which, at 30 stone an acre, and 10s. 6d. the stone, will give an annual produce of the raw material worth L.1,500,000. (Wakefield, I. 683.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">Spinning</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> was universal till the commencement of the present century; and, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of machinery has since been introduced, yet it is by no means invariably followed, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the very low rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> at which the manufacturers can get spinning performed by the wives and daughters of the labouring population. The Irish women have long been celebrated for their skill in this department. The earnings of the weavers depend on their industry, and the fineness of the materials on which they work. The average earnings of a linen weaver may be estimated at 7s. a-week. Their looms cost from four to five guineas, but many houses will hold three looms. The weavers estimate that, when working themselves, they can make a web a-week, and a web is, at an average, worth 10s.\n\nThe principal seat of the linen manufacture is in Ulster; but, with the exception of Wexford and Wicklow, where it is unknown, it flourishes all over Ireland. In the neighbourhood of Belfast, at Leitrim, at Londonderry, in Donegal and Tyrone, in Cavan, Louth, Meath, and Dublin, it flourishes in a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. The quantity sold in Dublin, during the year ending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1, 1809, appears from the following statement. (Reports of Linen Board, VI.; App. 18.)\n\nAverage value of 10,227 boxes inwards bound, L.1,636,320\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a> outwards bound, 9,279 boxes, 1,738,590\n\nTotal, L.3,374,910\n\nThe pieces of linen bleached in the county of Londonderry may amount to 250,000; and estimating the value of each piece at L.2, 5s. 8d., the actual value of the linen bleached in this county alone may be estimated at L.562,500. On the river Bann there are twenty bleachfields, which bleach annually, at an average, 8000 pieces, giving 160,000 pieces in all, the value of which is certainly above L.500,000. (Wakefield, I. 694.)\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Belfast and Leitrim, this manufacture has diffused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and prosperity; but in the remote districts of Mayo and Sligo, the effect upon the labouring poor has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> the reverse. So strongly does this appear, that Mr Wakefield gives it as his decided opinion, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the linen manufacture over the whole island, would bring with it an extension of poverty and famine, and would, if continued for any length of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, be the greatest curse which could be entailed on the country. (Ibid. I. 699.) It is remarkable, too, that this manufacture is solely the growth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> encouragement; for such is either the national aversion to industry in general, or to this branch of it in particular, that nothing is done without the assistance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. A spinner, to be industrious, must be presented with a wheel; a weaver, before he will work, must be supplied with a loom; a bleacher, to carry on his work, must be presented with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in Dublin, for the purpose of selling his commodity. (Ibid. 698.) The following is a table of the sums expended in bounties by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> during the undermentioned years.\n\n| Years | L.     | Years | L.     |\n|-------|--------|-------|--------|\n| 1802  | 13,857 | 1807  | 16,973 |\n| 1803  | 8,861  | 1808  | 11,184 |\n| 1804  | 13,064 | 1809  | 7,502  |\n| 1805  | 11,423 | 1810  | 21,768 |\n| 1806  | 13,243 | 1811  | 17,819 |\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">Cotton manufacture</a> was introduced into Ireland by Messrs Joly and McCabe in 1785, and seems, from the following table, to have taken a pretty strong root.\n\n| Cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">Wool</a> | Cotton Yarn |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| Average importation of cotton for three years, ending 1799, | 10,983 | 460,013 |\n| Ditto 1807, | 17,782 | 1,223,081 |\n| Ditto 1810, | 32,257 | 1,057,115 |\n\nThis manufacture is principally carried on in the neighbourhood of Belfast, where, in the year 1809, it appeared, that in a circle of 10 miles i. employed 27,000 persons. It has also spread to Dublin, Kil-\nIreland. dare, Wicklow, Wexford, and Louth. At Coulon in Louth, there are 1300 looms employed in calico <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a>. Upon the whole, this branch of industry is spreading rapidly in Ireland, and promises, at no distant period, to become a staple article of manufacture. (Wakefield, I. 705.)\n\nThe woollen manufacture does not exist to any considerable extent. It was formerly depressed and checked by the jealous commercial policy of England; and, though the Union has placed the two countries on an equal footing in this respect, the superior wealth and commercial enterprise of England have prevented all successful competition. Between 1794 and 1809, the total number of pieces exposed to sale, in the Woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a> of Rathdrum, did not exceed 55,000. The manufacture of woollen, however, in a coarse way, for their own consumption, is carried on to a great extent by the people. In many parts of the country the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the labouring poor manufacture their own woollen cloths. In some places the women not only make stockings, petticoats, &c. for their children, but some coarse woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> for sale. (Wakefield, I. 710; Survey of Clare, 179; of Kilkenny, 523.)\n\nThe manufacture of gloves, especially those called \"Limerick gloves,\" is carried on to a considerable extent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> was formerly wrought to good profit and in great quantities: but all the foundries are now in disuse. Hardware articles, however, are manufactured at Dublin, and coarse implements of husbandry at Carlow. (Ibid. I. 724.)\n\nThe Distilleries of Ireland are very extensive, and the quantity of spirits made at the unlicensed stills, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, still more considerable. In five years, from 1802 to 1806, 13,489 unlicensed stills were seized in Ireland, and 11,098 heads, and 9732 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>. The principal licensed distilleries are established at Limerick, Cork, Ross, Dublin, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DROGHEDA\">Drogheda</a>. In the year 1808, the greatest licensed distiller in the kingdom made 17,000 gallons a-week, and kept his distillery working between nine and ten months in the year. The following table exhibits the quantity of corn spirits for which duty has been paid in Ireland for ten years previous to January 5, 1813.\n\n| Year ending January 5, 1804 | Gallons |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Ditto                       | 4,426,085 |\n| Ditto                       | 1805    | 3,611,312 |\n| Ditto                       | 1806    | 3,756,671 |\n| Ditto                       | 1807    | 3,931,829 |\n| Ditto                       | 1808    | 5,707,158 |\n| Ditto                       | 1809    | 3,643,751 |\n| Ditto                       | 1810    | 72,996   |\n| Ditto                       | 1811    | 4,719,159 |\n| Ditto                       | 1812    | 6,500,361 |\n| Ditto                       | 1813    | 4,085,913 |\n\nDuring the greater part of 1810 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> was prohibited. From September 29, 1816, to February 5, 1817, there were 235,347 barrels of corn of 12 stone each used in distilling.\n\nIt is but of late years that public breweries have been established in Ireland, but they have spread to a great extent. The principal breweries are at Cork, Fermanagh, Limerick, Waterford, Roscommon, Dublin, Belfast, Cavan, Armagh, Donoughmore, and Dungarrow; one of the largest breweries in the island brews upwards of 100,000 barrels per annum. The following table shows the quantity of malt used in the breweries and distilleries from 1804 to 1817.\n\n| Year ending January 5, 1804 | 905,649 |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Ditto                       | 1805    | 715,479 |\n| Ditto                       | 1806    | 705,114 |\n| Ditto                       | 1807    | 717,232 |\n| Ditto                       | 1808    | 604,561 |\n| Ditto                       | 1809    | 662,019 |\n| Ditto                       | 1810    | 753,981 |\n| Ditto                       | 1811    | 642,850 |\n| Ditto                       | 1812    | 683,446 |\n| Ditto                       | 1813    | 562,234 |\n| Ditto                       | 1814    |         |\n| Ditto                       | 1815    | 804,327 |\n| Ditto                       | 1816    | 679,018 |\n| Ditto                       | 1817    | 479,033 |\n\nThe Export of Manufactures has increased very greatly within the last 40 years.

The income-tax was never introduced into Ireland.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of Union between Great Britain and Ireland, the latter was bound, besides paying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the debt contracted before that period, and other separate charges, to make good 1/3 of the public expenditure of the empire. This proportion was soon found to be much too great for her means. Notwithstanding a very great increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>, the debt of Ireland increased so fast, that its interest generally amounted to about as much as, and frequently exceeded, the total revenue of the country.\n\nIn this situation, and as the only means of avoiding a public bankruptcy, a proposition was submitted to Parliament for the consolidation of the English and Irish Exchequers. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> was carried into effect in 1816. The debt of Ireland was incorporated with that of Great Britain; and, since the 5th of January 1817, the incumbrances, revenues, and expenses of the two countries have been blended together in one mass. The produce of taxation in Ireland is now considered merely as making a part of the general income of the empire, without any regard to the arbitrary proportion fixed in the treaty of Union.\n\nThe following is a View of the Revenue and Expenditure of Ireland in different Years.\n\n| Year | Permanent Revenue | Expenditure |\n|---|---|---|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">Gross</a> Produce | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">Net</a> Payment | Total |\n| 1791 | L.1,805,964 | L.1,184,684 | L.1,514,258 |\n| 1800 | 3,445,718 | 2,805,536 | 1805 | 8,043,764 |\n| 1806 | 4,193,915 | 3,364,137 | 1810 | 9,348,476 |\n| 1815 | 6,937,558 | 5,525,699 | 1815 | 13,326,433 |\n\nThe total gross Revenue for the Year ending 5th January 1817, the year previous to the Consolidation of the Exchequers, derived from the following branches, amounted to\n\n- Customs: L. 2,082,043\n- Excise: 3,208,931\n- Stamps: 611,709\n- Post-office: 222,747\n\nL. 6,125,430\n\nThe total expence of collecting the various branches of the revenue of Ireland for the same year amounted to L. 1,014,342. The following is a statement of the rate per cent. at which this expence was incurred, viz. for every L.100 paid into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a> under the heads of\n\n- Customs: L. 35 14 3\n- Excise: 14 3 4\n- Stamps: 10 2 6\n- Post-office: 149 19 10\n\nSeparate Expenditure for the same Year.\n\n- Interest of debt: L. 4,399,460 14 2 3\n- Charges of management: 30,305 5 8\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SINKING_FUND\">Sinking <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">Fund</a>: 2,434,427 13 1 3\n- Interest on exchequer bills: 126,500 0 0\n- Issues for the separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Ireland: 3,836,869 16 3 3\n- Do. for local purposes: 43,690 12 2 1\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">Joint</a> Expenditure along with Great Britain.\n\n- Civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a>, pensions, &c.: 584,066 15 5 1\n- Payments in anticipation of exchequer receipts: 35,523 15 7 1\n- Ordnance: 140,000 0 0\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">Army</a>: 2,368,827 15 4 3\n- Miscellaneous services: 592,626 8 6 1\n- Vote of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, arrear of 1815: 20,261 9 9 5\n\nTotal: L. 14,612,560 6 4 1\nThe debt of Ireland, which, in 1800, amounted to about 25 millions, had increased in 1817 to about 152 millions, of which L. 141,441,180 was funded.\n\nPerhaps no country has suffered so much as Ireland from the oppressiveness of taxation. Since 1808 taxes have been imposed in that country, which our finance ministers estimated would produce three and a half millions. In point of fact, however, they have not produced a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>. The net revenue of Ireland in 1808 amounted to L. 4,417,990, while, in 1820, it only amounted to L. 3,605,446, being a decrease of L. 812,544. This fact affords a striking illustration of the folly of endeavouring to raise an additional revenue from an impoverished and exhausted country by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> increase of taxation. Had Government made any vigorous effort to stimulate the dormant energies of the people, to give them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the comforts and luxuries of civilized life, or to remove the most obvious of those causes of irritation and idleness which have so long distracted and depressed one of the finest countries in the world, the result would have been very different. But they contented themselves with adding to burdens which were already too heavy to be borne. The necessary consequences followed; consumption was diminished, the revenue declined, and all classes have been sunk deeper in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of poverty and misery.\n\nPublic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">Schools</a> and Charities.\n\nNotwithstanding the universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the Irish poor, the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, within their reach, are by no means inconsiderable. It appears from the reports of the Parliamentary Commissioners, who have inquired into this interesting subject, that \"there are 33 classical endowed schools in Ireland, besides 14 of private foundation, which educate nearly 1000 scholars; that, exclusive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> schools in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Dublin, and in other places, supported by private endowments, amounting in number to 72, there are 44 public establishments for the education of the lower orders, in which 4200 children are lodged, maintained, clothed, and educated. The annual expense of these establishments is about L. 70,000.\" (Report of Commissioners on Education.)\n\nThe following returns, as to the number of schools actually taught, have been obtained from 17 out of the 22 dioceses into which Ireland is divided.\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">Diocese</a>          | Number of Schools kept by Masters who are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> | Number of Schools kept by Masters who are Catholics | Number of Scholars who are Protestants | Number of Scholars who are Catholics |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Ardagh           | 21                                                     | 104                                                 | 1068                                  | 4310                                 |\n| Clogher          | 120                                                    | 221                                                 | 5702                                  | 5588                                 |\n| Cashel and Emly  | 31                                                     | 191                                                 | 746                                   | 10,815                               |\n| Cork and Ross    | 78                                                     | 103                                                 | 2082                                  | 5401                                 |\n| Cloyne           | 36                                                     | 143                                                 | 952                                   | 9347                                 |\n| Dromore          | 105                                                    | 44                                                  | 3806                                  | 1710                                 |\n\nFrom these returns, it appears that, exclusive of the charitable foundations, the number of children taught in these dioceses amounts to 200,000; that the schools of the two religions are 4600; and that there are, at an average, 48 scholars to a school. As these returns were made in winter, when many children cannot attend, and do not, besides, include the itinerant schoolmasters, it is probable, that the total number of children taught is more considerable. The instruction, except in a very few instances, goes no farther than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and the common rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>; and the fees paid, on an average, are 10s. per annum for reading, 17s. 4d. when writing, and L. 1, 6s. when arithmetic is added. (14th Report of Commissioners on Education.) These facts prove, that the means of education are afforded to the labouring poor; but they by no means show, that the people gain any useful information, or are at all advanced in the scale of moral beings, by this instruction; nor do they supersede the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a national establishment comprehending every parish in the island.\n\nIreland has no poor's rate; but in its principal cities a variety of most extensive charities are established. Many of them are maintained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> of individuals, and others by the munificence of government.\n\nThe following is a statement of the sums granted by the British government in the year 1818 to some of the principal charities and public establishments of the country.\n\n- Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">Charter</a> Schools: L. 38,331\n- Foundling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>: 32,515\n- House of Industry: 36,640\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a> Lunatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">Asylum</a>: 7,085\n- Fever expenses: 12,000\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a> of Dublin: 26,600\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a> Lock Hospital: 8,307\n- Dublin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>: 9,230\n- Society for Educating the Poor: 5,533\nGeneral Observations on the Condition of the People, and the Causes of their Depressed State.\n\nAll travellers who have inquired into the condition of Ireland, unite in representing the redundancy of the population as the main source of the sufferings of the people. One cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through a single county, without perceiving the most grievous effects resulting from this cause. In every town, in every village, there are multitudes of beggars, whose importunity testifies the need they have of assistance, while their famished and anxious aspect marks, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> not to be misunderstood, the anguish and suffering to which they have been subjected. The rich may exclaim against the impositions of the poor, and refuse charity to a hundred real objects of distress, because two or three have magnified their sufferings; but whoever will scrutinize the condition and appearance of the Irish poor will be convinced, that their miseries can hardly be exaggerated.\n\nNor is it merely in the incredible numbers, the incessant importunity, and deplorable aspect of the Irish beggars, that the superabundance of the population appears. It is an evil which is felt in every occupation, and in every corner of the land. In every line of life, in every branch of industry, there is an excessive competition for employment. If a small farm is to be let, the landlord is beset by numbers of persons wishing to take it; and who, in their anxiety to fix themselves somewhere, offer the exorbitant rent of L. 3, L. 4, and even L. 5 per Irish acre for land, which, under their system of management, will hardly produce this sum. It is from this cause that the number of Cottars is so inconceivably great, and that such high rents are given for the smallest pieces of potatoe land. In every other employment the same symptoms of a redundant population appear; and it is well known in the adjoining countries of England and Scotland, that wherever any public work is undertaken, there is almost instantly an inundation of Irish poor, seeking that employment which they cannot obtain at home.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">Emigration</a>, as might be expected, prevails, and has long prevailed, to a great extent in Ireland; but it has been unable to retard the progress of population. Between the years 1690 and 1745, it is computed that 450,000 Irishmen perished in the service of France alone. (Newenham's Ireland, 58.) Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> almost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> has Irishmen in its service; and, independently of the vast swarms which continually come over to Britain, upwards of 4000 have annually, for a long period back, emigrated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. (Ibid. 59.) During the year 1816, when the distress of the country was very great, the emigrants to America swelled to the enormous number of 30,000. (Newenham, 59; Wakefield, II. 712.) But this drain, great as it undoubtedly is, and materially as it must affect the population, from being composed entirely of persons in the prime of life, is not perceived amidst the multitudes who remain. Every employment is still thronged to excess; and the departure of those who emigrate retards rather than accelerates the progress of wealth; for those who go have all acquired some little capital, and habits of industry, the subduction of which dries up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of national prosperity.\n\nThe actual population in 1805 has been estimated, by Mr Newenham, at 5,400,000 souls. Mr Wakefield, after demonstrating, that, in 1791, it amounted to 4,200,000, observes, that, since that period, a very great increase has taken place. (Wakefield, II. 712.) The rate of increase has been estimated by Mr Newenham and Mr Wakefield at an annual addition of one-forty-sixth to the whole population; in other words, the numbers of the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> in forty-six years. (Newenham, 220. Colquhoun, 21.) Thirty years ago, Mr Young expressed his astonishment at the prevalence of early marriages in this country. (Young, II. 198.) Mr Newenham and Mr Wakefield have reiterated the same observation in their late publications. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> is lined with cottages, every cottage swarms with children. Under circumstances of unexampled distress during the last three years, the number of marriages and the multitudes of children have suffered no diminution.\n\nAs might be expected in a country where the increase in the numbers of mankind has so far outstripped the progress of its wealth and the increase of its industry, the condition of the people is in every department marked by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> indigence. (Dewar, 91; Young, II. 123.) The houses in which they dwell, the furniture in their interior, their clothing, food, and general way of life, all equally indicate the poverty of the country. In these respects, however, some improvement was observable, even at the time when Mr Young's Tour was written, and it has gone on increasing to a certain extent since that period. In the south of Ireland, the cottages have, in many instances, feather-beds; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> which they owe to the numbers of geese and poultry with which the country abounds,\u2014a plenty which, in some degree, compensates to them for the many other privations to which they are subject. Considerable improvement in the condition of the peasantry was beginning to take place in the south towards the conclusion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, in consequence of the immense market and high prices which the consumption of the army and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> afforded; but these dawnings of prosperity have been almost totally overclouded by the distress of the last years.\n\nIt appears from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> laid before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the House of Commons, that, in the year 1817, there were in Nicolson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a>, Dublin, 151 persons crowded into 28 small rooms; of these 89 were unemployed, and there were only two bedsteads and two blankets in the whole Court. In Barrack Street were 85 houses, the apartments in which were extremely crowded: 52 houses contained, in 390 rooms, 1318 persons, of whom 332 were adults.\n\n* Young's Ireland, II. 197; Dewar's Ireland, 94; Newenham, passim; Wakefield, passim.\nout of employment, the greater part of whom were in extreme indigence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> Street contained 181 houses, which were greatly more crowded than in Barrack Street.\u2014In 71 houses of this street, and the adjoining courts, no less than 1997 persons were lodged in 393 apartments; of these 123 had been infected by fever within three months. There are many cellars in these houses which have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> but from the door, which, in several, is closed only by bundles of rags, vegetables, and other articles. In these cellars the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> on the floors, which are all earthen.\n\nThe dress of the people is so wretched, that, to a person who has not visited the country, it is almost inconceivable. Shoes or stockings are seldom to be seen on children, and often not on grown persons. (Young, II. 121.) The rags in which both men and women are clothed are so worn and complicated, that it is hardly possible to imagine to what article of dress they have originally belonged. It has been observed that the Irish poor never take off their clothes when they go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>; but the fact is, that not only are they in general destitute of blankets, but, if they once took off their clothes, it would be difficult to get them on again. Their dress is worn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and night till it literally falls to pieces; and, even when it is first put on, it is usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-off clothing; for there is not one cottager out of ten who ever gets a coat made for himself. A considerable trade has long been carried on from the west of Scotland to Ireland, consisting of the old clothes of the former country, and to those who know how long all ranks in Scotland wear their dress, there is no more convincing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the poverty of the latter country can be given.\n\nIn England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> and shops are established in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, where the people may buy their necessaries and conveniences. In Ireland there is neither the one nor the other. The Irish poor, indeed, have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the comforts of life; and if they felt their full value, they could not afford them, for though necessaries are cheap, conveniences of all sorts are very dear. Owing to the deficiency of manufacturing capital, the price of the commonest articles is fully as high as in Britain, while the money wages of labour are not equal to half the earnings of the English labourer; being in general from 8d. to 1s. 2d.; a sum altogether inadequate to obtain any portion of the comforts of life.* (Newenham, 272, 273.)\n\nBut while the Irish poor are in general destitute of all the accommodations, they hardly ever, except in years of extraordinary distress, know what it is to want the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> necessaries of life. The unsparing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> of potatoes, at which the beggar, the pig, the dog, the poultry, and the children, seem equally welcome, seldom fails the Irish labourer. In many cottages, the potatoe pot is constantly on the fire, and the children help themselves when they please (Young, II. 121); and to this cause, joined to the general use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, is to be ascribed the healthy appearance of the children in cottages which would seem to be the abode of the most abject misery.\n\nThe laziness of the lower Irish is very great. (Wakefield, II. 776.) In many places it is so excessive, that two shillings a-day in England would be cheaper in the end than sixpence in Ireland. (Young, II. 117.) This cannot be imputed to their potatoe diet, for there are numerous instances of persevering industry in Ireland. It is owing to the habits, the mode of payment, and the occupations of the labouring classes. Limited as their wants are to the mere support of animal life, they do not engage in labour with that persevering industry which artificial desires inspire; and the mode in which they are often paid, that is, the giving them a piece of potatoe land by the year, at once furnishes the means of subsistence, and takes away every stimulus to farther exertion. The farm-servants of the English or Scotch farmers, who carry on agriculture upon the improved system, are constantly employed in some species of labour; but after the potatoes of the Irish cottar are planted, there is hardly any thing to be done about his little croft till the season of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> arrives. During a great portion of the year he is doomed to idleness, and the habits he acquires during these long periods of almost total inaction, are too strong to be overcome when he is transferred to a more regular occupation.\n\n* There is no person who has visited Ireland who must not be convinced that, generally speaking, these observations are strictly true. But, though the general aspect of the country is that of poverty and wretchedness, yet there are particular districts in which the progress of improvement has been so rapid and striking as to afford the most animating prospects; and even over the whole country, the increased consumption of articles of comfort, during the last twenty years, is very remarkable. \"That Ireland,\" says Wakefield, \"has made a wonderful progress in improvement, will not, I think, be denied by the gloomiest politician. In the neighbourhood of Belfast, this change has been peculiarly striking. This town, which, about a century ago, hardly deserved notice, is now, in trade and consequence, the fifth in the kingdom; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, whose food consisted chiefly of potatoes, now use wheaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>; thousands sleep in blankets and sheets who were formerly contented with a covering of straw. Having been frequently in Ireland during the last thirty years, my own observation has convinced me that a considerable change of habits has taken place, and that a taste for a more refined mode of life is beginning to diffuse itself among the people.\" (Wakefield, II. 65.) From the official return of the imports into Ireland from 1772 down to 1811, it appears that a prodigious increase in the consumption of articles of luxury has taken place in that period; far greater than the augmentation during the same time in the numbers of the people. (Ibid. II. 53.)\nSuch is the condition of the labouring classes. Ireland exhibits the extraordinary example of a country, in which, under the most distressing circumstances, population has advanced with the most rapid pace; in which cultivation has advanced without wealth, and education without diffusing knowledge; where the peasantry are more depressed, and yet can obtain subsistence with greater facility, than in any other country of Europe. Their miserable condition will not appear surprising when the numerous oppressions to which they are subject are taken into consideration.\n\nIn the foremost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of their many grievances, the general prevalence of Middlemen must be placed. It is difficult to estimate the extent of the misery which the system of letting and subletting land has brought upon the Irish cultivators. It has been observed, that the great cause of the prosperous situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, is, that he pays his rent at once to the sovereign; that no person is substituted between the cultivator of the ground and the great landholder. (Thunberg's Travels.) With <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> it may be said, that one great cause of the misery of the Irish peasant is to be found in the number of persons who are interposed between the landlord and the cultivator; for the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of their labour finds its way into the pockets of this middle class. (Wakefield, I. 287.) To absent landholders, middlemen are almost unavoidable; for without their intervention their estates could not be managed, and the collection of rents would be impossible. Middlemen have, in every country, been the inseparable attendants of absent proprietors: and in such a country as Ireland, where there are numbers of disaffected persons in every quarter, the vigilant eye of a superior inspector is more particularly required.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of England, the landlord is entitled to distrain for payment of rent, not only the stock- ing which belongs to his immediate tenant, but the crop or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> of a subtenant; on the principle, that whatever grows on the soil ought to be a security to the landlord for his rent; and in Scotland the same rule holds where the landlord has not authorized the subtack; but if he has, the subtenant is free when he has paid to the principal tenant. There is little hardship in such a rule in England, where the practice of subletting is generally speaking, rare; but when applied to Ireland, where middlemen are universal, it becomes the source of infinite injustice; for the cultivator being liable to have his crop and stocking distrained on account of the tenant from whom he holds, and there being often many tenants interposed between him and the landlord, he is thus perpetually liable to be distrained for arrears not his own. The tenant, in a word, can never be secure, though he has faithfully paid his rent to his immediate superior; because, he is still liable to have everything which he has in the world swept off by an execution for arrears due by any of the many leaseholders who may be interposed between him and the landlord. It is obvious that such a system must prevent the growth of agricultural capital. This, joined to the exactions of the middlemen, has been the true cause of the universal prevalence of the cottage system, and the minute subdivision of farms.\n\nThe mode in which the poorer classes are treated is strongly descriptive of their depressed situation. \"The labouring poor,\" says Mr Young, \"are treated with great harshness, and are in every respect so little considered, that their want of importance seems a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to their situation in England, where, comparatively speaking, they reign as sovereigns. The landlord of an Irish estate, inhabited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESPOT\">despot</a>, who yields obedience, in whatever concerns the poor, to no law but his own will. The language of the law may be that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, but the situation of the poor may speak nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. There is too much of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in Ireland. A long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of oppressions, aided by many very ill judged laws, have brought landlords into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of exerting a very lofty superiority, and their vassals into that of unlimited submission. Speaking a language which is despised, professing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> which is abhorred, and being disarmed, the poor find themselves in many cases slaves, even in the bosom of written liberty.\" (Young, II. 127.)\n\nIn England, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">Tithes</a> can hardly be said, in a national point of view, to amount to a grievance. The precarious situation of the clergyman, possessing only a life interest in the benefice, joined to the wealth and consequence of the farmers and landholders by whom he is surrounded, precludes him, in the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, from exerting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> to their full extent, and softens the evil which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> powers with which he is invested might otherwise produce. But, in Ireland, the case is far otherwise. The relative situation of the farmer and of the clergyman are totally different, and a very different system in regard to the collection of tithes is pursued. The clergyman is, in general, far richer than any farmer in his parish; and he is connected with the Protestant interest, which has so long exercised an unlimited sway. Independently of the extreme poverty of the farmers, the livings in Ireland are, in general, much larger, and more lucrative than in England; so that the relative situation of the clergyman and his parishioners is totally different in the two countries. From the wealth and influence of the clergy, joined to the destitute situation of their parishioners, the tithes have long been collected with a severity, of which hardly any European state furnishes an example. They fall, by the law of that country, only on the tillage land, the greater part of which is held by cottar tenants; and thus the rich are exempted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> their share of the burden. (Wakefield, II. 486.) Almost everywhere the tithes are let to Tithe Proctors, who are acquainted with every man in the parish, who know the utmost length to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a> can go, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> their powers with the most merciless severity. These proctors, besides what they pay to the clergyman or lay-impropriator, realize large incomes to themselves out of the produce of their extortions. When it is recollected, what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> ferocity has always been exercised towards these collectors in...\nevery commotion, it may be conceived how deeply their severity has been felt. (Ibid. II. 486, 487.)\n\nWhat renders the tithing system peculiarly oppressive in Ireland is, that its exactions fall upon cottars who give the full value of the land in the rent paid to the landlord. The number of the labouring classes is so great, and the other branches of industry in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> so inconsiderable, that the unfortunate poor are driven to take little spots as their only means of subsistence. The competition between them is so excessive, that they offer the highest possible rent for the land; as much, indeed, as the whole produce is worth, after their own food is deducted. The tithe is not considered by these unfortunate people; or if it is, they trust to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of accidents for the means of paying it. But even if they had all the foresight of the Scotch peasant, they could not do otherwise; for having no other means of living, and being too poor to emigrate, they are compelled to run against each other for little farms; and of this competition the landlords too often avail themselves to screw the rent to the highest possible rate which the poor can afford to pay. (Wakefield, II. 493.) When the cup of misery is full, a drop will make it overflow. The tithes in Ireland are this drop. Inconsiderable as they are when compared with the burden which the tenants have to sustain in their rent, yet, when placed in addition to it, they operate as the last and most grievous oppression with which they are afflicted. To this cause we are to impute the remarkable fact, that while in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, where the tithe of potatoes is exacted, frequent risings have occurred during the last forty years; in Ulster, where no tithe is required, risings are unknown. (Wakefield, II. 493; Life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Charlemont, 87, 88.)\n\nWhat increases the hardship of this burden upon the people is, that it is not only imposed to support an establishment which they detest, which they consider as the badge of their national subjection, and which is so often negligent of its duty; but that it is an addition to a very expensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> establishment of their own, which they are obliged to support. The Irish Roman Catholic clergy, a numerous and not indigent body, are supported entirely by the contributions of the people; and the greater part of the income of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESBYTERIANS\">Presbyterians</a> in the north is derived from a similar source. On occasion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> receives from these poor people from two to three guineas; and the difficulty of raising this sum is perhaps the only check on the progress of population. (Newenham, p. 51.) From this and other sources, the income of the Irish Catholic clergy is, except in years of extraordinary distress, very considerable; and this is a burden which falls solely on the poorer classes. Thus are the Irish peasantry, who, of all nations in the world, are the least able to support it, burdened with two separate ecclesiastical establishments, each of which levies its dues with the most rigid exactness; the one armed with the terrors of temporal authority, the other with the still more formidable weapons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>.\n\nAnother grievance, though not so extensive, is the fine imposed upon a township, for having had the misfortune to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a> for illicit distillation made within its bounds. Numerous are the families which have been utterly ruined, in every part of the country, by this most oppressive law. Many individuals are now languishing in prison who have been seized for the fine imposed on their township for an illicit still, of which they were utterly ignorant, or which they may have made the most vigorous, though ineffectual, efforts to oppose.\n\nFrom the facts collected by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a> (Chichester on Still Fines) on this interesting subject, it appears, that during seven years, from 1809 to summer 1816, the still fines levied amounted to L. 356,925, or L. 50,989 a-year; and the evidence of Sir John Stewart before the House of Commons shows, that, from 1809 to 1815, L. 26,825 has been levied upon the county of Tyrone alone, and, on the county of Donegall, L. 72,540. It appears, from the same authority, that the stills are of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> as to be generally incapable of discovery; that no provision is made for the case of absentees, who have, in more than one instance, been ruined by fines levied on their estates, while abroad on the service of their country; that the power thus vested in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the revenue officers has been the occasion of infinite individual distress, as well as public discontent; and that the fines are levied, in general, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force, and terminate in the utter ruin of the peasantry on whom they fall.\n\nThese evils have been attended with the usual depressing effects of oppression. They have prevented the growth of any artificial wants, or any desire of bettering their condition among the mass of the people. Despised by their superiors, and oppressed by all to whom they might naturally have looked for protection, the Irish have felt only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> instincts of their being. Among the Presbyterians of the north, and in the vicinity of manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, higher notions of comfort may have imposed some restraint on the principle of population; but the poor humiliated Catholics, enjoying no respectability or consideration in society, have sought only the means of subsistence; and finding, without difficulty, potatoes, milk, and a hovel, have overspread the land with a wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\nTo these causes of a redundant population, of which the government of the country is, directly or indirectly, the source, are to be added others, of a different kind.\n\nThe first is the influence of the parish priests, who encourage marriage in order to increase their own emoluments, and the superstition of the people, who regard it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> duty. (Wakefield, II. 690.) In a country where the priests possess so much control over the lower ranks, and where the influence of artificial wants is so little felt, this circumstance must have a powerful effect. To this cause, joined to the degraded situation of the Catholic population, is to be ascribed the much greater frequency of marriages among the lower orders of that persuasion than among the Protestants. (Ibid. II. 578.)\n\nThe second cause is the general ignorance of the\npeople. On the influence of education, in restraining the tendency to early and imprudent marriage, it would be superfluous in this place to enlarge. It is a mistake to imagine, however, that this almost universal ignorance, of which so much has been said, by almost every writer on the state of this country, is the result either of any inaptitude of the people to learn, or of any very remarkable deficiency in the means of education. The Irish evince everywhere the greatest anxiety for education, whenever the means are afforded. In the remote mountains of Kerry, schools are sometimes found in the wildest situations, where rocks supply the place of desks and benches.

The anus is terminal, immediately above which is the entrance to the pulmonary cavity; and on the right is the opening to the female organs, from which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> runs towards the right lobe of the snout.\n\nThis genus, which we have named in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of M. Peron, was referred by Cuvier to the Onchidium of Buchanan, which we have already noticed, and the species termed O. Peronii. It was found creeping upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> rocks, under water, at the Mauritius, by M. Peron. M. Cuvier conjectures that it breathes free air, and has accordingly inserted it among the Pulmones aquatique. Some doubts, however, may reasonably be entertained about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this supposition. It would certainly be an unexpected occurrence to find a marine gasteropodous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">mollusca</a> obliged to come to the surface at intervals to respire. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> probably be found that it is truly branchiferous.\n\nII.

Branchiae issuing from the cloak dorsally.\n\n1. Body exposed, and destitute of a shell.\n\nIn many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> the back is covered with perforated papillae, which pour out a mucous secretion. All the species are hermaphrodite, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>.\n\na.

Towards its anterior margin are placed the two superior tentacula. These are retractile, surrounded at the base with a short sheath, and supported on a slender stem, having an enlarged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> plicated summit. The neck is short, and above the mouth there is a small projecting membrane, connected at each side with the oral tentacula, which are in general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and of difficult detection.\n\nThe following species are natives of the British seas: 1. D. Argo; 2. verrucosa; 3. levis; 4. marginata; 5. nodosa; 6. quadricornis; 7. nigricans.\n\nGenus, Polycera.\u2014Oral tentacula more than two.\n\nThe branchiae, when withdrawn, are protected by two scales. The superior tentacula resemble those of the Doris, the oral ones are more numerous, sometimes amounting to six. P. flavo and pennigera are British examples.\n\nb. Anus situate on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> side, and unconnected with the branchiae.\n\n(A.) Mouth furnished with cornaceous jaws.\n\nThese jaws are in the form of narrow plates, which cut the food by crossing each other like the blades of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of scissors.\n\n(1.) Branchiae disposed along the back or sides, and unconnected with membranaceous expansions.\n\n(a.) Tentacula limited to two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>.\n\nGenus, Tergipes.\u2014Branchiae furnished with sheaths at the base.\n\nThe branchiae form a single row on each side, and are qualified to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as suckers. The Limax tergipes of Forsk\u00e5l, Des. An. p. 99, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of the genus. T. maculata, described by Montagu, Lin. Trans. VII. p. 80, T. vii. f. 8, 9, is a British example.\n\nGenus, Tritonia.\u2014Branchiae destitute of basilar sheaths.\n\nThe branchiae are in the form of plumes, or imbricated productions, placed in a row on each side the back. The tentacula, which are partially retractile, have a sheath at the base. In some of the species there are indications of eyes. The T. arborescens, pinnatifida, and bifida, are examples of British species.\n\n(b.) Tentacula four in number.\n\nThe branchiae are simple, tapering, or clavate, and disposed in transverse rows on each side. These branchiae in some species readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off, and are capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> about in the water for a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> independent. This is executed by means of minute hairs with which their surface is covered, and which move rapidly, pushing forward the distal extremity.\n\nGenus, Montagna.\u2014Branchiae in continuous rows across the back.\n\nThis genus, which differs from the other not merely in the arrangement of the branchiae, but in possessing a cluster of short papillae on the right side, probably connected with the anus, we have ventured to name in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the late George Montagu, the well-known author of Testacea Britannica, and of several valuable papers in the Linnean Transactions, on molluscous animals. The two species which may be referred to this genus were detected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a> by this observer. The first, M. longicornis, Lin. Trans. Vol. IX. p. 107. Tab. vii. f. 1, is the type of the genus. The other species, M. cerulea, Lin. Trans. Vol. VII. p. 78. Tab. vii. f. 4, 5, is probably the type of another genus.\n\nGenus, Eolida.\u2014Branchiae interrupted on the back.\n\nThis genus, which was instituted by M. Cuvier, includes the following British examples: 1. E. papillosa; 2. plumosa; 3. pedata; 4. purpurascens.\n\n(2.) Branchiae disposed on lateral membranaceous expansions.\n\nThese expansions serve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> purpose of supporting the branchiae, and acting as fins.\n\nGenus, Scytlea.\u2014Branchiae seated dorsally on the fins. Tentacula two.\n\nOn each side of the back are two membranaceous expansions, and one on the tail, supporting on their dorsal surface scattered plumose branchiae. The tentacula are each furnished with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> funnel-shaped sheath. The foot is very narrow, with a mesial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, used in climbing up the stalks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> weeds. The mouth is placed at the base of the tentacula, and surrounded with a semicircular lip. The tongue is in the form of a tubercle, with reflected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. The gullet is plaited longitudinally. The stomach is short and cylindrical, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of hard longitudinal scales. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> consists of six unequal globules, and the bile is poured into the cardiac extremity of the gullet. The Scytlea pelagica has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> known to naturalists, and appears to\nbe very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the equatorial seas, adhering to the stems of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUCUS\">Fucus</a> natans*.\n\nGenus, *Glaucus.*\u2014Branchiae seated on the margin of the fins. Four simple tentacula.\n\nOn each side of the body there are three or four membranaceous expansions, the margins of which are fringed with the simple branchial filaments. This genus was instituted by R. Forster, and the oldest known species, *G. radiatus*, is figured, *Phil. Trans.* Vol. LIII. Tab. iii.\n\n(B.) Mouth destitute of corneous jaws.\n\nGenus, *Thethys.*\u2014Branchiae forming a row on each side the back, consisting of fringed processes, alternately larger and smaller.\n\nThe *T. fimbria* is the type of the genus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of which, with its anatomical details, is given by M. Cuvier, in his *M\u00e9moire sur le Genre Thethys*.\n\n2. Body concealed in a Spiral Shell.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> includes the genus *Valvata* of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a>, represented by two British species, *V. cristata* (*Helix cristata* of Montagu) and *V. piscinalis* (*Turbo fontinalis*). These resemble in aspect the aquatic pulmoniferous gastropoda. The branchiae appear in the form of a feather, with a central stem, and a row of compound branches on each side, decreasing in size from the base to the free extremity. It issues from the neck near the middle, a short way behind the anterior tentaculum. Near this plume, but towards the right side, is a single simple filament, like a tentaculum. The anterior tentacula occupy the usual position, are setaceous, and have the eyes placed at the base behind. The spiral shell is capable of containing the body, and the aperture can be closed by a spirally striated operculum attached to the foot. The internal structure is unknown.\n\nB. Branchiae issuing laterally from between the cloak and foot.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> includes the orders *Cyclo-branchia* and *Infero-branchia* of Cuvier, which we have ventured to bring together, as connected by the common character of the position of the gills.\n\n1. Body protected dorsally by a shelly covering\u2014*Cyclobranchia*.\n\na. Shell simple.\n\nGenus, *Patella.*\u2014Shell entire. Mouth with tentacula.\n\nThe species belonging to this genus are numerous, and appear to admit of distribution into sections; the first having the branchial circle complete, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> interrupted.\n\nb. Shell divided.\n\nGenus, *Chiton.*\u2014Shell constituting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of imbricated dorsal plates.\n\nThe body is elliptical. The cloak is firm and cartilaginous, and variously marked on the margin. The dorsal plates are arched, and occupy the middle and sides of the back, where they are implanted in the cloak, in an imbricated manner, the posterior margin of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> covering the anterior of the second. The foot is narrow. The mouth is surrounded with a semicircular curled membrane, and is destitute of tentacula. The anus consists of a short tube, placed at the posterior extremity of the cloak. The external orifice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> has not been detected.\n\nGenus, *Chitonellus.*\u2014Dorsal plates not imbricated.\n\nIn this genus, instituted by Lamarck (*Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vertebres*, Vol. VI. p. 316), the shells are slender, narrow, and are disposed longitudinally, and not in contact, along the middle of the back, leaving the sides of the cloak naked. Two species, *C. larvis* and *striatus*, were brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, by Peron and Le Sueur.\n\n2. Body naked. *Inferobranchia*.\n\nGenus, *Phyllidia.*\u2014Anus placed dorsally near the extremity of the cloak.\n\nM. Cuvier has given descriptions of three from the tropical seas, which differ remarkably in the protuberances of the cloak.\n\nGenus, *Diphyllidia.*\u2014Anus placed on the right side.\n\nThis genus was formed by M. Cuvier in his *Regne Animal*, Vol. III. p. 395, from an imperfectly investigated animal, in the cabinet of M. Brugmans at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>. The cloak is pointed behind, with a feeler and small tubercle on each side.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nBranchiae simple, and concealed when at rest under a lid. *Tectibranchia* of Cuvier.\n\nA. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> furnished with tentacula.\n\n1. Tentacula four in number.\n\na. Branchiae lateral.\n\nGenus, *Aplysia.*\u2014Branchiae with a corneous lid.\n\nThe *A. depilans*, the type of the genus, is of frequent occurrence on the British shores. The *A. punctata* of Cuvier may be regarded merely as a variety.\n\nIt is probably at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the genus *Gasteroplax* of Blainville, published by Lamarck, under the ill-judged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> *Umbrella* (*Hist. Nat. &c.* Vol. VI. p. 339), should be introduced. The following is the extended character which he has communicated.\n\n\"Corpus valde crassum, obovatum, testa dorsali onustum; pede amplissimo, subtus plano, undique prominente, anterioris sinu emarginato, postice attenuato. Caput non distinctum. Cavitas infundibuliformis in sinu antico pedis os in fundo recondens. Tentacula quatuor: superiora duo, crassa, brevia, truncata, hiac fissa, intus transversim sublamellosa; altera duo, tenuia, cristata, pedicellata, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> oris latera. Branchiae foliaceae, serratim ordinatae, infra <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTIS\">cutis</a> margine per totam longitudinem lateris dextrii. Anus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> extremitatem posticum branchiarum.\n\n\"Testa externa, orbicularis, subirregularis, planula, superne convexiuscula, albida, versus medium mucrone apiculicri brevissimo praedita; marginibus acutis: interna facie subconcava; disco calloso, colorato, ad centrum impresso, limbo lavi cincto.\"\n\nDoubts seem to be entertained whether the shell is to be considered as belonging to the cloak or the foot. Two species are known.\nGenus, Notarchus.\u2014Lid of the branchiae soft.\n\nThere is an oblique groove from the neck leading to the branchiae. The structure is similar to Aplysia. M. Cuvier instituted this genus in his Regne An. Vol. II. p. 395, and Vol. IV. Tab. xi. f. 1.\n\nb. Branchiae terminal.\n\nGenus, Dolabella.\u2014Dorsal plate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> shell.\n\n2. Tentacula two in number.\n\nGenus, Pleurobranchus.\u2014Cloak and foot expanded, between which, on the middle of the right side, the branchiae are placed.\n\nB. Head destitute of tentacula.\n\nGenus, Bulla.\u2014Body of the animal protected by a convoluted shell.\n\nM. Lamarck is inclined to divide this genus into two, distinguishing those in which the shell is concealed, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Bullae, from such as have the shell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> exposed, which he retains in the genus Bulla. The shells of the genus Bullae are thin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, as B. aperta; those of Bulla stronger, more opaque, and covered with an epidermis, which, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the animal, is easily detached, as B. ligaria.\n\nGenus, Doridium (of Mekel).\u2014Destitute of a dorsal plate or shell.\n\nThere is a cavity in the cloak, with a spiral turn. The branchiae, and accompanying organs, are placed far behind. There is here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> appearance of a spinous tongue; the gullet is simple, and the stomach is membranaceous. D. carnosum, a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, is the type of the genus.\n\nII. Order.\n\nBranchiae Internal.\n\nThese aerating organs are contained in a cavity, and appear in the form of sessile pectinated ridges.\n\n1. Subdivision.\n\nHeart entire, and detached from the rectum.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>, forming the Pectinobranchia of Cuvier, includes nearly all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> gastropoda which have spiral univalve shells. It likewise contains a few species which inhabit the fresh water.\n\n1. Tribe.\n\nShell external.\n\nThe shelly covering exhibits all the variations of the spiral form. The internal structure has hitherto been in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> neglected, so that the characters, employed in the methodical distribution of the species and genera, are derived from the shelly appendage of the cloak. The groups, therefore, are merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>.\n\nA. Aperture of the shell entire.\n\nAs co-existent with this character of the shell, the anterior margin of the cloak, at the entrance to the branchial cavity, is found likewise to be entire.\n\n1. Aperture of the shell closed by a pedal lid, or operculum.\n\nThe three following families appear to be the indications of as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> groups, the genera of which admit of still more minute arrangement.\n\n1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">Family</a>, Turbonidae.\u2014Aperture of the shell round or ovate.\n\nThis family includes the greater number of the species of the Linnean genus Turbo. The genera into which it is now divided may be distributed into two sections, from the residence of the animals.\n\n1. Section, Marine.\n\nThe marine turbonidae are of frequent occurrence, and compose the genera Turbo, Delphinula, Turritella, Scalaria, Odostomia, Monodonta, Phasianella, and Vermicularia. Some of the species are known to be ovoviviparous, and it is probable that the same kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a> prevails in all of them. Remarkable differences may be observed in the form of the hood, the length of the peduncles supporting the eyes, and the number and distribution of the filaments surrounding the body.\n\n2. Section, Fluviatile.\n\nThe fluviatile turbonidae are limited in their number both in regard to genera and species. The genera are only three, Ampullaria, Melania, and Paludina. In the last of these, including the Helix vivipara and tentaculata, the sexes are distinct in different individuals.\n\n2. Family, Neritidae.\u2014Aperture semicircular, with an oblique straight pillar-lip.\n\n1. Section, Marine.\n\nThis includes the genera Nerita and Natica.\n\n2. Section, Fluviatile.\n\nThis contains only the genus Neritina, including Nerita fluviatilis of Linnaeus.\n\n3. Family, Trochusidae.\u2014Aperture of the shell subquadangular.\n\nAll the genera, including Trochus, Solarium, and Pyramidella, are marine. The cloak on each side is usually ornamented with three filaments.\n\n2. Aperture of the shell exposed.\u2014The foot destitute of a lid. Marine.\n\nGenus, Janthina.\u2014Foot with an adhering spongy body.\n\nIn this genus, represented by the Helix Janthina of Linnaeus, the spongy body is capable of changing its dimensions, and enabling the animal to sink or rise in the water at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. When irritated, it ejects a purple fluid from the cellular margin of the cloak above the gills, not unlike the Aplysia.\n\nGenus, Velutina.\u2014Foot simple.\n\nThis genus was formed by us for the reception of the Bulla velutina of Muller (Zool. Dan. Tab. ci. f. 1, 2, 3, 4), the Helix leavigata of British writers.\n\nB. Anterior margin of the aperture of the shell canalicated.\n\nThis groove in the aperture of the shell is produced by the anterior margin of the cloak being extended over the opening into the gills, for the purpose of acting like a tube or syphon, in conveying the water to and from the branchial cavity. The species are considered as oviparous, with distinct sexes in separate individuals.\n\n1. Shell convoluted.\u2014The shell has a lengthened\nmouth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> with its length. The whorls, which are small segments of large circles, are wrapped round the pillar, and rising little the one above the other, embrace or enclose the preceding ones. The four following families appear to belong to this division.\n\n1. Family, Conusideae.\u2014Furnished with a long proboscis, and produced tentacula, with the eyes near the summit on the outside. The genera Conus and Terebellum form this family.\n\n2. Family, Cypreidea.\u2014Cloak enlarged, and capable of folding over the shell. There is no lid. The genus Cyprea is the type.\n\n3. Family, Ovuladeae.\u2014Both extremities of the aperture canaliculated. The inhabitants of all the genera, Ovula, Calpurna, and Volva, are unknown. The last genus includes the Bulla patula of Pennant.\n\n4. Family, Volutadeae.\u2014Canal of the aperture abbreviated. Pillar-lip plaited. The foot appears to be destitute of a lid. The genera are numerous. Voluta, Oliva, Cymbium, Marginella, Cancellaria, Mitra, Ancilla, Volvaria, and Tornatella. The last genus contains the Voluta tornatilis of British writers.\n\nShell turrited.\u2014The whorls of the shell, the revolving spire of which is subconical, scarcely embrace one another, but are merely united at the margins. Three families may here be established.\n\n1. Family, Buccinidae.\u2014Canal short, scarcely produced beyond the anterior margin of the lip, and bent towards the right. The tentacula are remote, and the head is destitute of a hood. The mouth has a retractile proboscis. The following genera belong to this family: Buccinum, Eburna, Dolium, Harpa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NASSA\">Nassa</a>, Purpura, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASSIS\">Cassis</a>, Morio, and Terebra.\n\n2. Family, Muriceteae.\u2014Canal produced, and straight. The tentacula approach. The head and mouth as in the preceding family. The genera are, Murex, Typhis, Ranella, Fusus, Pleurotoma, Pyrula, Fasciolaria, and Turbinella.\n\n3. Family, Cerithiadeae.\u2014Canal short and recurved. Head with a hood. This family contains the marine genus Cerithium, and the fluviatile one Potamidium.\n\n4. Family, Strombusideae.\u2014Canal short, and bent towards the right. The outer margin of the aperture becomes palmated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and exhibits a second canal, generally near the former, for the passage of the head. The following are the genera: Strombus, Pterocera, and Rostellaria.\n\nShell internal.\n\nThis tribe consists at present of only one genus, termed Sigaretus, two species of which are natives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\n\nSubdivision.\n\nHeart traversed by the rectum.\n\nThis group includes the order Scutibranchia of Cuvier. In general form, and in structure and position of the branchiae, the resemblance is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the genera of the preceding subdivision. They differ, however, in many particulars. The heart is furnished with two auricles, and is perforated by the intestine. The sexes appear to be incorporated in the same individual, or rather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> organs are unknown. The body is protected by a shell, the aperture of which is wide, and never closed by a lid.\n\n1. Tribe.\n\nShell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>-shaped, flat, with a lateral, and nearly concealed spire.\n\nFamily, Haliotidae, including the genera Haliotis, Padola, and Stomatia. These genera exhibit well-marked characters in the shell. The left margin of the shell in Haliotis is pierced by a row of holes. In Padola, these holes are nearly obliterated; but there is an internal groove and external ridge in the line of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. In Stomatia, there are neither holes nor ridges.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nShell conical, simple, or slightly revolute at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>:\n\nA. Cavity of the shell interrupted by a testaceous plate. This division consists of three genera, each of which may be regarded as the type of a family, although, for the present, they all be included in one.\n\nFamily, Crepidulidae.\u2014The marine genera are, Crepidula and Calyptraea, the latter including the Patella Chinesis of British writers. There is only one fluviatile genus, termed Navicella.\n\nB. Cavity of the shell entire.\n\n1. Family, Capulideae.\u2014Shell entire.\n\nThis includes the genera Capulus (containing Patella Hungarica and antiquata of British writers) and Carinaria, represented by the Argonauta vitria.\n\n2. Family, Fissurellidae.\u2014Shell with a slit, or perforation.\n\nIn the Fissurella, the apex of the shell is perforated. In Emarginula, there is a slit in the anterior margin.\n\nII. Division.","sp":884,"ep":888},{"h":"CEPHALOPODA","t":"Fins in the form of tentacula, surrounding the mouth.\n\nCephalopodous animals consist of a body and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. The body is surrounded by a sac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> tunic, closed posteriorly, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> open anteriorly, for the oriaces of the several organs.

The grey, brown, and black varieties which generally occur massive, and in various particular and extraneous external forms, and exhibit a glimmering lustre, conchoidal fracture, and feeble translucency, are named flint. The semi-transparent and translucent varieties, in massive and various particular external forms, with an even and dull fracture surface, are named common calcedony. The beautiful apple-green strongly translucent varieties are named chrysopease. The grass-green varieties, with glimmering lustre, conchoidal fracture, and strong translucency, are named plasma. The semi-transparent and strongly translucent varieties, with glistening or shining vitreous lustre and conchoidal fracture, and with various tints of red, brown, yellow, green, and white, are named carnelian. The beautiful variety, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELIOTROPE\">heliotrope</a>, is well characterized, on a general view, by its green colour, and disseminated spots of red and yellow jasper. Those varieties, in which the colours are red, brown, and black, and seldom yellow or green, which occur massive and disseminated, with a fracture ranging from conchoidal to earthy, and lustre from glistening to dull, and are opaque, are named jasper. And, lastly, the white and grey varieties, which are so porous and light, as to swim on the surface of water, are named spongiform quartz, or floatstone.\n\nGeognostic and Geographic Situations.\u2014Quartz is very universally distributed, and, as far as we know at present, is the most abundant mineral in nature.

The milk-white varieties, with the beautiful play of various rich and pure colours, are named precious opal. The transparent varieties, with the beautiful carmine-red and apple-green iridescence, are named fire opal. Those varieties which are milk-white, and frequently dendritic, with a pearly, shining, or glistening lustre, conchoidal fracture, and complete opacity, are named mother-of-pearl opal, or cacholong. The common opal differs from the precious, principally in wanting the play of colour. The feebly translucent varieties, with conchoidal fracture, and glistering vitreo-resinous lustre, and white, grey, and brown colours, are named semi-opal. Those varieties, in which the colours are red, yellow, and grey, with a shining vitreo-resinous lustre, conchoidal fracture, and opacity, are named jasper-opal.

The parts of the mouth are similar to the coleoptera, with the addition of the galea protecting the maxilla at the sides. The alimentary canal is furnished with a membranaceous crop, and a muscular stomach, armed with cornaceous scales. The pyloric ceca receive the biliary vessels, and a few likewise terminate in the intestine. The larvae exhibit a pupa semi-complete.

In the Evanidae, including Evanias and Fenius, the joints of the antennae do not exceed fifteen in number. In others, the under wings are destitute of ribs. The Cynipidae have the antennae broken, with from six to twelve joints, as Cynips, Leucopse, Chalcis, and Cynipellum. The Diplolepidae have the antennae straight, with from eleven to sixteen joints, as Dipolepis and Euclares.\n\nThe remaining families have the abdomen united to the thorax by the whole of its transverse diameter. In the Sirexinae the piercer consists only of three valves, the lateral ones serving as sheaths, as Sirex and Oryssus. In the Tenthradidae, including Tenthrado, Cimbex, Hylotoma, Xiphedria, and Pamphilus, the piercer consists of four valves, the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a>.\n\nII. Hymenoptera Aculeata.\u2014In this order are included such as have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> ovipositor or piercer. The abdomen in the females, however, is usually furnished with a sting, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> bags. The antennae have thirteen joints in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>, and twelve in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>. These may be again reduced into two divisions. In the first, the feet are not formed for collecting pollen, and the first tarsal joints are cylindrical. Among these, there are two families, in which the ocelli are indistinct, and the neuters or females are apterous. The Formicidae, including Formica, Polyrergus, Ponera, Myrmica, Atta, and Cryptocerus, have males, females, and neuters, the last of which are apterous. They live in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>. The Mutillidae have no neuters, and the females are apterous, as Mutilla, Dorylus, and Labidus. They are solitary. The others have the ocelli distinct, and are all furnished with wings. Among these there are some families in which the wings are always expanded. In the Scoliidae, the first segment of the thorax is large, and extends above to the base of the upper wings, as in Scolia, Tipha, Sapyga, Thynnus, and Pampilius. In the Sphecidae, the first segment of the thorax is narrow and distant above from the base of the upper wings, as in Sphex, Bembex, Larra, Crabro, and Philanthus. There are other families in which the upper wings fold longitudinally. In the Masaridae, the mandibles are narrow. There are only males and females, which are solitary, as Massaris, Synagris, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUMENES\">Eumenes</a>, and Zethus. In the Vespidae, which are social, there are males, females, and neuters; the mandibles are large, as Vespa and Polistes.\n\nIn nearly all the remaining genera, the hind legs are made for carrying pollen, having the first tarsal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> enlarged and compressed. Among these are some in which the tongue, or intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of the labium, is as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, or longer than its sheath, and deflected when at rest. In the Apidae, which are social, there are males, females, and neuters, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIS\">Apis</a>, Melepona, Bombus, Euglossa, Eucera, and Anthophora. While agreeing with the preceding in many particulars, the following genera are destitute of the expanded tarsal joint, for carrying pollen, Systropha, Panurgus, Zylocopa, Ceratina, Megachile, Philereinus, and Nomada. Others have the tongue shorter than the sheath, as the Andrenidae, including Andrena, Halectus, and Colletus.\n\nCLASS X.","sp":330,"ep":330},{"h":"CLASS VI","t":"TRICHOPTERA.\n\nThe wings of the trichopterous insects are four in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and membranaceous. The upper ones are usually of a darker <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and firmer consistence than the lower ones. The ribs, which are usually hairy, are disposed longitudinally, and when they do anastomose, the intervening spaces are lengthened. The lower wings fold longitudinally. The mouth has a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRUM\">labrum</a>; the maxillary palpi have five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. The labial palpi have only three joints, the last of which is a little enlarged. The maxillae and labium are united, but do not form a sucker. There are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> eyes, and two ocelli. The legs are spinous, and the tarsal joints five in number. The larvae live in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in tubular dwellings, which they construct, and move about with, open at both ends, and consisting of bits of stick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> shells. Hence, they are usually termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>. They change into a pupa incompleta in the tube, which they inhabited when larvae, and when ready for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a>, by means of the sheathed antennae, and fore and mid-legs, crawl out of the water, throw off the covering, and become inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>.\n\nDr Leach has subdivided this class into two families. The Leptoceride have the antennae much longer than the whole body, as Leptocerus and Odontocerus. The Phryganide have the antennae only the length of the body, as Phryganea and Limnophilus.","sp":328,"ep":329},{"h":"CLASS VII","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEPIDOPTERA\">LEPIDOPTERA</a>.\n\nThis extensive and beautiful class consists of the butterflies and moths. The wings are four in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, membranaceous in texture, irregularly ribbed, and covered with coloured scales, in the form of a farinaceous powder. The parts of the mouth are formed for suction. There are only vestiges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRUM\">labrum</a> and mandible. The maxillae are produced, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> on the inner edge. When united, as they are naturally, they form a tubular proboscis, through which the animal obtains its food. The maxillary palpi are inserted upon the base externally, and are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. The labium is short and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and supports two obvious palpi with three joints. There are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> eyes, and in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> two ocelli. The antennae consist of many joints, and are usually much longer than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. The segments of the thorax are united. The tarsal joints are six in number. The larvae have six feet with claws, and from four to ten others on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> portion of the body, which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> as suckers. They are changed into a pupa obtecta. The genera are now divided into three orders, corresponding with the Linnean genera Papilio, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHINX\">Sphinx</a>, and Phalena.\n\nI. LEPIDOPTERA DIURNA.\u2014The upper wings, at least, in all the species are vertical in a state of rest, and the lower ones are destitute of hooks. The antennae are clavate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> filiform, with hooked extremities. Among these, the Papilionide have the hinder tibiae furnished with two spines, situated at the tarsal end, as in Papilio, Parnassius, Thais, Pieris, Polyomatus, Heliconius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANAUS\">Danaus</a>, Cethosia, Libythea, and Nymphalis. The Hesperiad\u00e6, including Hesperia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URANIA\">Urania</a>, have four spines to the hinder tibiae, two in the middle and two at the tarsal extremity, as in the remaining lepidoptera.\n\nII. LEPIDOPTERA CREPUSCULARIA.\u2014The wings are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> in repose, and the under ones are furnished with a spine under the base, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> margin which enters a hook on the lower side of the upper wings, as in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. The antenn\u00e6 are prismatic and fusiform. The Glaucoptid\u00e6 have the antenn\u00e6 bipectinated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> at least, as Glaucopis, Stygia, and Procris. The antenn\u00e6, in the remaining genera, are simple in both sexes. The Zygenid\u00e6 have the palpi slender and hairy, as Zygena, Sesi\u00e6, and Macroglossum. The Sphinxid\u00e6 have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> scaly palpi, as Sphinx, Smerinthus, and Castinea.\n\nIII. LEPIDOPTERA NOCTURNA.\u2014The insects included under this division have setaceous antenn\u00e6, diminishing in thickness from the base to the point. Among these, there are several families, in which the wings, when at rest, fold round the body. The Pterophorid\u00e6 have the margins of two of the wings, at least, divided into processes at each rib, as Pterophorus and Ornades. The other families of the division have the four wings entire. The Tinead\u00e6 have only two palpi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, as Tinea, Yponomeuta, Occophora, Lithosia, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADELA\">Adela</a>. In the Alucitad\u00e6, there are four palpi apparent, as Alucita, Crambus, and Galleria. Other families have the wings at rest, lying upon the body without inclosing it, and by their union form a lengthened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>. The Aglossad\u00e6 have four apparent palpi, as Aglossa and Botys. The Pyralid\u00e6 have only two apparent palpi, as Pyralis, Hermenia, and Platytperix. In the third division, the wings do not rest upon the body so as to form a triangle. This extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> includes the following genera, Phalena, Campaea, Noctua, Callimorpha, Bombyx, Furcula, Hepialus, and Cossus.\n\nM. Savigny has observed, that, in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where the maxillary palpi have only two joints, the proboscis is naked or pubescent; and when they consist of three joints, the proboscis is always scaly.","sp":329,"ep":329},{"h":"CLASS VIII","t":"NEUROPTERA.\n\nThe wings in this class are generally four in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, wholly membranaceous, transparent, and greatly reticulated by the anastomosing ribs. The under wings are either larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> longer than the upper ones. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRUM\">labrum</a>, mandible, maxillae, and labium, are of the ordinary size, and formed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>. There are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> eyes, and two or three ocelli. The segments of the thorax are united, support the six legs, and are distinct from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>.\n\nIn some of the families, the antenn\u00e6 are about the length of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, subulate, and consist of from three to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, the last of which is setaceous. Among these the Libellulad\u00e6, including Libellula, Aeshna, and Agrion, have three tarsal joints, the mandible and maxill\u00e6 cornuous, and the terminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of the abdomen, furnished with hooks or scales. In the Ephemeralid\u00e6, the mandibles are obscure,\nthe tarsal joints four in number, and the terminal ring of the abdomen furnished with setae, as in Ephemera, Baetis, and Cloeon.\n\nIn other families, the antennae are much longer than the head, and consist of sixteen joints and upwards. Among these the Panorpidae, including Panorpa, Nemoptera, Bittaces, and Boreus, have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> produced into a snout. The remaining families have the front short. In the Myrmeleontidae the antennae are clavate, and the palpi six in number, as Myrmelion and Ascalapuss. The two remaining families have filiform antennae. The Termitidae have from two to three tarsal joints, as Termites and Pscus. The Hemerobiidae have four or five tarsal joints, as Hemerobius, Raphidia, Mantispa, Scalis, Corydalis, Chauliodes, and Osmylus. The Perlidae, including Perla and Nemoura, have the inferior wings folded longitudinally.","sp":329,"ep":330},{"h":"CLASS XI","t":"APTERA.\n\nInto this class we have placed tribes of insects, which differ greatly from each other in the organs of digestion; but which do not agree with any of the preceding classes. They possess one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> character in wanting wings, in all the stages of their existence. They may be divided into three orders, which by some are elevated to a primary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>.\n\nI. APTERA SUCTORIA.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, thorax, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a> intimately united. The mouth consists of two simple processes, the lowest of which is longest, and receives the superior one in a cavity in its upper side. On each side is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> covering the others. These unite to form a proboscis, which rests upon the sternum. Are the simple processes to be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRUM\">labrum</a> and labium, and the articulated lateral ones as palpi, the mandibulae and maxillae being absent. The antennae consist of four joints. This order contains at present only one genus, Pulex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Flea. There are several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. The P. irritans is everywhere common, and the P. fasciatus of Bosc may be met with on moles and mice.\n\nII. APTERA THYSANURA.\u2014The head in this and the following order is obviously separated from the thorax by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> or neck. The last segment of the body is furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> filaments. In the Lepismad\u00e6 the set\u00e6 of the tail are continually extended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the body, as Lepisma and Forbicinia. In the Podurad\u00e6, the set\u00e6, when at rest, are folded under the body, as Podura and Smynthurus.\n\nIII. APTERA PARASITA.\u2014The tail in this order is simple, or destitute of the filaments which distinguish the preceding. The Nirmid\u00e6, including numerous species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LICE\">lice</a> which infest birds, and included in the genera Ricinus and Pediculus of authors, have the mouth furnished with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. The Pediculid\u00e6 have a tubular proboscis, and include the genera Pediculus, Phthirius, and Haematopinus. (q.q.)","sp":331,"ep":331},{"h":"COLEOPTERA","t":"The insects of this class have their integuments of a coriaceous consistence, approaching, in some genera, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of shell. The wings are four in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. The upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a>, denominated elytra, are of the same texture with the skin. They are convex above, concave below, and, when at rest, their mesial margins join by a straight suture. In some genera the elytra are inseparably united at their suture, and in others, the elytra at the base of the suture are in contact, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> lap over each other, while at the extremity they recede from each other. The inferior pair of wings are membranaceous, strengthened by mastomosing ribs, and when at rest they are folded obliquely and transversely, and concealed under the elytra. When the insect is about to fly, the elytra are raised, and remain fixed while the under wings unfold and execute their motions. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, the under wings are imperfectly developed, or nearly obliterated, and, consequently, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> is impracticable. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> the elytra are cemented at the suture. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a> consists of six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> rings more or less covered by the elytra, each of which have two sigmatia, one on each side. The antenn\u00e6 exhibit a great variety of character in their situation, length, form, and number of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. The eyes are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> and two in number. Each eye, in some, is divided by the continuity of the marginal band of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> ocelli. The intrumenta cibaria are formed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> and masticating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> substances. The food, however, which is consumed by them differs greatly, according to the species, in kind and consistence, so that all the parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> system exhibit extensive modifications of form. They are all oviparous. The larva is lengthened, frequently destitute of antenn\u00e6 and eyes, of twelve or thirteen rings, with a scaly head, and the parts of the mouth similar to the perfect insect. It has usually six feet. After continuing months, or even years, in the larva state, it changes into a pupa obtecta, through the skin of which the different members may be distinctly perceived. The coleoptera in their perfect state require a supply of food, and live to a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> than other insects. They are very numerous in species and genera. Linnaeus subdivided this extensive order into three groups, according as the antenn\u00e6 were clavate, filiform, or setaceous. M. Geoffroy employed the number of joints in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARSUS\">tarsus</a> as the basis of his subdivisions. This method, though it separates a very few naturally connected genera, and is liable to some exceptions, is nevertheless so simple and easy of application, that it has been universally received throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nI. COLEOPTERA PENTAMERA.\u2014Under this head are included those species which have five joints in each tarsus. The genera which they form are distributed by Lamarck into three sections, according as the antenn\u00e6 are filiform, including those which are moniliform and setaceous, clavate or lamellate. (Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vert\u00e8bres, Tom. IV. p. 439.) Latreille, whose industry and acuteness have contributed greatly to extend the limits of entomology, has subdivided them in the following manner. (R\u00e9gne Animal, par M. Cuvier, III. p. 173.)\n\nI. PENTAMERA CARNIVORA.\u2014The distinguishing character of the insects here referred to, and one which is peculiar to them, is the possession of six palpi, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of four, the ordinary number, two of these attached to the labium, and two to each maxilla. The maxill\u00e6 are hooked, and covered on the inside with stiff hairs or spines. They have two stomachs. The first is short and muscular; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> more produced, with villous walls. The hepatic vessels are four in number, and terminate at the pylorus. The antenn\u00e6 are filiform or setaceous. The thighs, of the middle and hind legs, furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROCHANTERS\">trochanters</a>. They are carnivorous both in their larva and perfect state. In the former the body consists of twelve rings, the head and the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> scaly, with two short antenn\u00e6.\n\nI. Carnivora Terrestria.\u2014The feet are formed for walking. The mandibul\u00e6 are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, the body is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, and the eyes prominent. The intestine terminates in a large cloaca, with two vesicles secreting an acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>.\n\n1. Cicindelidae. The maxill\u00e6 are furnished with an articulated claw. Mandibul\u00e6 prominent, straight, and denticulated; eyes large and full; labium short; the tibia of the fore legs destitute of a notch on the inner side. In the genera Manticora, Cicindela, Megacephala and Therates, the breadth and the length of the thorax are nearly equal, and all the joints of the tarsus are entire. In the genus Collyris of Fabricius, changed by Latreille into Colliuris, the thorax is narrow, and produced, and the penult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> of the tarsus is bilobated.\n\n2. Carabidae. The maxill\u00e6 destitute of the articulated claw. In general, the head is narrower than the thorax, and the mandibul\u00e6 are destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. This very numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> has been divided by Latreille into seven sections.\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> maxillary and labial palpi, with the last joint equal or larger than the preceding. The tibiae of the fore legs have a deep notch on the inner side; elytra truncated or obtuse; labium entire and oval, or nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; the head is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>-\ned behind; and, with the thorax, is narrower than the abdomen; the thorax is heart-shaped and truncated behind, and its length never exceeds, but frequently falls short of its breadth. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> includes the following genera: Anthia, Graphipterus, Brachinus and Lebia. This last genus has been subdivided into the following genera by Bonelli, viz. Hellus, Cymindus, Lamprias, Dromius, and Demetrias.\n\n2. The genera of this section exhibit the same form of palpi and elytra. The head is deeply divided from the thorax, to which it is joined by a socket; the labium is furnished on each side with a lobe; the thorax is lengthened; the penultimate joint of the tarsi frequently bilobate. The genera are, Zephium, Galerita, Drypta, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGRA\">Agra</a>, and Odacantha.\n\n3. The palpi and tibiae present the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> as the preceding. The elytra are not truncated; the suture of the mentum is obsolete. This includes the genus Sinagona.\n\n4. The genera of this section differ from the preceding ones, in the tibiae being denticulated externally. The second and third joints of the antennae are nearly equal and moniliform; the elytra are entire, and the mentum articulated. This includes the genera Scarites and Clivina.\n\n5. The elytra are entire; the mentum articulated; anterior tibiae entire externally, with short terminal spines; labium pointed in the middle, with lateral lobes. This section contains the genera Ozena, Morio, Aristus, Harpalus, Feronia, Licinus, Badister, Panagaeus.\n\n6. The elytra are entire, and the anterior tibiae very slightly, or not at all notched; labium pointed. This includes Cyclus, Pamborus, Calosoma, Carabus, Nebria, Omophron, Pogonophorus, Loricera, and Elaphrus.\n\n7. In this last section, two at least of the exterior palpi are pointed at the extremity. The anterior tibiae are notched. Bembidion, Trechus, and Apolomus.\n\nII. Carnivora Aquatica. The feet of the insects here referred to are formed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>. The mid and hind legs are compressed or ciliated; the mandibles are concealed; the terminal hook of the maxillae bent from the base; the thorax is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>; they live in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> both in the larva and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGO\">imago</a> state. The larvae are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and narrow, with twelve rings; the head large, with strong hooked mandibles, pierced at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>. The body has six feet.\n\n1. Dyticidae. The antennae are filiform, and longer than the head. In the males of many species, the three first joints of the tarsi of the mid and forelegs are dilated, and furnished with complicated suckers. In a few genera, the tarsi of the mid and fore legs have only four joints, as Hyphydrus and Hydroporus; in the others, the tarsi are entire, as Haliphus, Pelobius, Noterus, Laccophilas, Colymbetes, Hydaticus, Aclius, and Dytiscus.\n\n2. Gyrinidae. The antennae are here clavate, with a subsidiary ciliated one at the base of each; each eye divided into two by the marginal band of the head. There is only one genus belonging to this family, Gyrinus.\n\nII. Pentamera Microptera.\u2014The insects of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> constituted the genus Staphylinus in the Linnean system. They are characterized by their filiform or moniform antennae, sometimes thickening a little towards the end. The body is narrow, and the elytra scarcely reach to half the length of the abdomen. The coxae of the fore and mid legs are remarkably large. Two bags are protruded at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> from the anus. They run and fly readily. When pursued, they elevate their head and abdomen, and assume a very threatening attitude. They frequent moist places, in the neighbourhood of putrid animal or vegetable substances. A few are found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, in pursuit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> insects. Their first stomach is very short, and without folds; the second is long and villous, with a short intestine. The species are very numerous, and have been divided into many genera, which admit of the following distribution:\n\n1. Head exposed, and separated from the thorax by an obvious mark. Among these there are some which have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRUM\">labrum</a> deeply divided into two lobes. The Staphylinidae are distinguished by their filiform palpi, and consist of the following genera: Staphylinus, Pinophilus, and Lathrobium. The Oxyporid\u00e6 have the four palpi, or at least the labial ones, terminated by an enlarged joint, as in Oxyporus and Astraphus. In other genera, the labrum is entire. In the Pederidae, the maxillary palpi are nearly the length of the head, as in Pederus, Evactetus, and Stenus. In the Oxytelidae, the maxillary palpi are greatly shorter than the head, and the antenn\u00e6 are inserted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the eye, as in Oxytelus, Sinognion, Omalium, Piester, Proteinus and Lesteva. The Aleocharidae differ from the preceding family in the antenn\u00e6 being inserted between the eyes, as in Aleochara.\n\n2. Head sunk in the thorax as far as the eyes. In the Lomechusidae, the tibiae are entire, as in Lomechusa. In Tachinidae, the tibiae are spinous, as in Tachinus and Tachyporus.\n\nIII. Pentamera Sericicornua.\u2014The elytra cover the abdomen; the antenn\u00e6 are usually filiform, or slightly clavate; and, in the males particularly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a>, pectinated, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLUMOSE\">plumose</a>. In some of the genera, the thoracic sternum is advanced in front, under the head, and likewise produced behind. This character is exhibited in those which have the mandibles notched or bifid at their extremity, as the Elateridae, a numerous family, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> genera have not yet been established; and, in those which have entire mandibles, as Buprestidae, having filiform palpi, and containing the genera Buprestis, Tracy's, and Aphanisticus; and the Melasidae, in which the palpi have an enlarged terminal joint, as Melasis and Cerophytum.\n\nIn those whose thoracic sternum is destitute of the singular character exhibited by the preceding families, there are several genera in which the mandibles are forked at the apex, or furnished with a tooth beneath. In some the body and elytra are soft. In these the head is furnished with a neck in Lymoxyloniidae, in which the elytra do not embrace the abdomen, as Lymoxylon, Hylecactus, Atractocerus, and Cupes; and, in Mastigoid\u00e6, in which the abdomen is embraced by the elytra, as in Mastigus and Scydmanus. In others, the neck is concealed, as in\nMALACHIUSID\u00c6, which exhibit, as a peculiar character, four vesicles divided into lobes, under the thorax and the base of the abdomen, which can be withdrawn or exerted and inflated at pleasure. The Melyrid\u00e6 have the palpi filiform, as Melyris, Dasytes, and Drilus; while in Clerusid\u00e6, the palpi are secuiform as Clerus, Tillus, and Enoplium.\n\nIn those families where the body and elytra are firm and crustaceous, the Ptinusid\u00e6 have the head and thorax narrower than the abdomen, with the antenn\u00e6 about the length of the body as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTINUS\">Ptinus</a> and Gibbium; and the Anobiidae, having the thorax of the size of the abdomen, and the antenn\u00e6 much shorter than the body, as Anobium, Pilenus, and Dorcatoma.\n\nThere are several genera which agree with some of the preceding in the softness of their bodies, but whose mandibles are entire at the apex. In some of these the palpi are filiform, as in the Cerroniad\u00e6, which have tarsal joints entire, as Cebrio and Hammonia; and in Scirtesid\u00e6, which have the penultimate joint of the tarsus bifid, as Scirtes, Elodes, Rhopicera, and Dascillus. In others, the palpi, especially the maxillary ones, become thicker towards the extremities. In the Lampyrinae the antenn\u00e6 are approximate at the base, and the maxillary are longer than the labial palpi, as in Lampyrus, Lycus, and Omalisus. In the Telephonidae, the antenn\u00e6 at the base are remote, and the labial and maxillary palpi are nearly of equal length, as in Telephorus and Malthinus.\n\nIV. PENTAMERA CLAVICORNUA.\u2014The antenn\u00e6 are here obviously club-shaped, perfoliated or solid, generally exposed at the base, and longer than the maxillary palpi. In a few genera, forming the family Dryopsid\u00e6, the first and second joints of the antenn\u00e6 are enlarged, and the remainder form a club nearly solid, so that they appear three jointed; as Dryops, Hydrena, and Heterocerus. In the remaining families, the antenn\u00e6 increase more gradually from the base, and the club consists of several joints. In some of these the pectoral sternum is produced under the head towards the mouth. In the Histeridae, the mandibles are prominent, and the antenn\u00e6 geniculated, as Hister, Abricus, Onthophilus, Dendrophilus, and Platysoma. In the Byrrhidae, the antenn\u00e6 are straight, as Byrrhus, Throscus, Anthrenus, Chelomarium, Nosodendron, Elmis, Macronychus, Georcessus, and Megatoma. In other genera, the pectoral sternum is abbreviated in the usual form, as the Dermestidae, which have the mandibles, short, thick, and straight, at the extremity, as Dermestes and Attagenus. In the remaining families, the mandibles are lengthened, compressed, and hooked, at their extremity. The Nitidulidae, the mandibles are notched, bifid, or furnished with a tooth at their extremity, as Nitidula, Biturus, Cateletes, Micropapulus, Tymalus, Colobicus, Engis, Ips, Scaphidiump, Scaphisoma, and Choleva. The Silphidae have the extremities of the mandibles entire, as Silpha and Necrophorus. The insects of this family are reputed to feed on carrion, and to dig under dead mice and moles, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> them in order to feast upon them more securely. These statements are without foundation. They feed on maggots, and their pup\u00e6; and, in penetrating the ground in search of the last of these, they loosen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> so much, that the dead animal sinks under, by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, or, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, is elevated on a hillock.\n\nV. PENTAMERA PALPICORNUA.\u2014The maxillary palpi nearly equal, or surpass the elevated antenn\u00e6 in length. These last are inserted in a pit beneath an unusual production of the anterior margin of the head. In the Hydrophilidae, the first joint of the tarsus is abbreviated, and the legs are flattened, and formed for swimming, as Hydrophilus, Spercheus, Elophorus, and Hydrena. In the Sphingidae, the five joints of the tarsus are distinct, as in Sphingid\u00e6 and Ceryon.\n\nVI. PENTAMERA LAMELLICORNUA.\u2014The insects of this division are readily recognized by their club-shaped antenn\u00e6, the extremity of which is divided into laminae, capable of receding or approaching at pleasure. The Lucanidae differ from all the rest of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> in the laminae of the club of the antenn\u00e6, being placed (not as in the other families, approximating at the base, and opening and shutting like the leaves of a book, but) like the teeth of a comb, perpendicular to the axis, as Lucanus, Sinodendron, Esalus, Lamprina, Platyceeres, and Passalus. In the Coprid\u00e6, the membranaceous termination of the maxill\u00e6 is large and transverse; the antenn\u00e6 have eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> joints; the labrum is concealed by the semicircular margin of the head; the mandibles are soft; and the last joint of the labial palpi comparatively small, as Copris, Aleuchus, and Aphodius. The Geotrupidae have the terminal joint of the labial palpi as large as the preceding one; the antenn\u00e6 have eleven joints, and the mandibles are horny, as Geotrupes, Lethrus, and Typhus. In the Scarabaeidae the antenn\u00e6 have nine joints. The labium is concealed by the mentum, as Scarabeus, Trox, Egialia, Oryctes, Hexodon, and Rutella. The Melolonthidae have the mandibles greatly concealed by the head and the maxill\u00e6, as Melolontha and Anoplognathus. In the Glaphyrid\u00e6 the labium is advanced and divided into three lobes, as Glaphyrus, Amphicoma, and Anisonix. The Trichiad\u00e6 have membranaceous mandibles, as Trichiuss, Goliathus, Cetonia, and Crematoschalus.\n\nII. COLEOPTERA HETEROMERA.\u2014The insects belonging to this great subdivision have the tarsi of the fore and mid legs furnished with five joints, as in the preceding, but the tarsi of the hind legs have only four joints. In a few genera, as Rhinomacer, Rhinosimus, and Stenostoma, constituting the family Rhinomacrid\u00e6, the front of the head is advanced into a snout, on which are seated the antenn\u00e6. In the remaining genera, the front exhibits the usual characters. In some, the head is triangular, or heart-shaped, and is furnished with a neck, and the maxill\u00e6 have no cornuous tooth on their inner edge. Among these, there are some which have the claws simple, as the Pyrochroid\u00e6, with bilobate tarsi, including the genera Pyrochros, Notoxus, Scraptia, and Dendrocerca. In the Mordellad\u00e6, in which the tarsi of the hind legs at least are simple, are included the Mordella, Rhipiphorus, Anapsis, Hores, and Apalus. Among others, the claws are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, or deeply divided. In the genus Traconix, the penultimate joint of the tarsi is bilobate, in the others entire. In the Mylabrid\u00e6, the an-\nInsects.\n\ntennae are thickened at the extremity, as in Mylabris, Hycleus, Cerocoma, while in the Cantharidae, the antennae are of equal thickness throughout, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> towards the point, as Cantharis, Meloe, Zonites, and Onas.\n\nAmong those genera which have the head oval and destitute of a neck, there are some which have the maxillae furnished with a cornaceous tooth on the inner side. The elytra in some are free, and cover membranaceous wings, as the Tenebrionidae, including Tenebrio, Opatrum, Crypticus, Sarrotrium, and Toxicum. In many other genera, the elytra are united, and the membranaceous wings are nearly obliterated. Some of these have the maxillary palpi filiform, with the last joint nearly cylindrical. The Erodusidae have the maxillae covered with the mentum, as Erodius and Pinelia. In the Scauridae, the base of the jaws are exposed, as Scaurus, Tagenia, Sepidium, Moloris, Tentyria, Hegester, Eurychora, and Akis. Others have the extremity of the maxillary palpi enlarged, or secundiform. In the Asididae, the base of the maxillae is concealed by a large mentum, as Asida and Chiroscelis. In the Blapsidae, the base of the maxillae is exposed, as in Blaps, Misolampus, and Pedinus.\n\nThe genera, in which the maxillae are destitute of a cornaceous tooth on the inner side, are likewise numerous. Many of them have the antennae cylindric, or slightly tapering. The Melandriidae have the penultimate joint of all the tarsi bilobate, as Melandra, Lagria, Calopus, Nothus, Odemera, Stegostoma, and Rynomacera. In the Helopsidae, the joints of the tarsi, at least those of the hind legs, are entire, as Helops, Serropalpus, Hallomenus, Pytho, Nilio, and Cistela. Others have the antennae more or less club-shaped, and generally perfoliated. The Heleidae, including the genera Helea and Cossyphus, have the head concealed, or received into a notch in the front of the thorax. The remaining families have the head exposed and projecting. In the Diaperidae, the insertion of the antennae is concealed by the lateral margin of the head, as in Diaperis, Hypophleus, Trachyscelis, Eldona, Cnodalon, and Epitragus. In the Leiodesidae, the insertion of the antennae is exposed, as in Leoides, Tetratomata, Eustrophus, and Orchesia.\n\nIII. Coleoptera Tetramera.\u2014The tarsal joints of all the feet are four in number. They are phytophagous, and live chiefly in wood or on flowers. In one extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>, the head is produced in front, in the form of a snout. Among these there are two genera, Bruchus and Anthribus, in which the snout is short, and the labrum and palpi distinct. In the remaining genera the snout is long, and the labrum and palpi obscure. In the Curculionidae, including the genera Curculio, Rhynchenus, Cionus, Calandra, and Rhina, the antennae are distinctly geniculated. The Brentusidae have antennae destitute of the knee, as Brentus, Orchestes, Rhamphus, Brachycerus, Cydas, Apoderus, Attelabus, and Apion. In another group, equally numerous, the forehead is of the usual size. Among these, there are some which have eleven joints in the antennae, and the third joint of the tarsi bilobate. The antennae, in some, terminate in a perfoliated club, as the Erotylidae, including Erotylus, Triplax, Lanugria, and Phalacrus. In others, the antennae are filiform. In the Cerambicidae, the labium is dilated and heart-shaped at the extremity, including the genera Cerambix, Prionus, Callidium, Necydalis, Saperda, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-LAMIA\">Lamia</a>, Stenocerus, Leptura, together with Spondylis and Parandra. In the Chrysomelidae, the antennae are shorter than in the preceding family, and the labium is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>. It includes the following genera, Chrysomela, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CASSIDA\">Cassida</a>, Cryptcephalus, Clytra, Galeruca, Altica, Hispa, Crioceris, Donacia, and Sagra.\n\nIn those which have not eleven joints in the antennae, and the third tarsal joints bilobate at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there are some which have the third tarsal joints entire. The Mycetophagidae have eleven joints in the antennae, as Mycetophagus, Ulciota, Cucujus, Agathidium, Zylophila, Meryx, and Trogosota. In the Bostrichidae, the joints of the antennae do not exceed ten, as Bostrichus, Cerylon, Nemosoma, Cis, Cerapterus, and Pausus. The Scoletusidae have the penultimate tarsal joint bilobate, as Scolytus and Phloeotribus.\n\nIV. Coleoptera <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-TRIMERA\">Trimera</a>.\u2014The tarsi in this division are all three-jointed. The antennae are clavate. In the Coccinellidae, the antennae are shorter than the thorax, as Coccinella and Chilocorus. In Endomychidae, the antennae are longer than the thorax, as in Endomychus, Lycoperdina, Dascarus, and Eumorphus.\n\nV. Coleoptera Dimera.\u2014The tarsal joints are only three in number. The genera hitherto determined amount only to two, as Claviger and Pselaphus. The latter, however, has been recently constituted into a family, Pselaphidae, including Pselaphus, Euplectus, Bythenus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCOPAGUS\">Arcopagus</a>, Tychus, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-BRYAXIS\">Bryaxis</a>.","sp":324,"ep":327},{"h":"DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATE","t":"1.

The tongue is trifid at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>, underneath which the maxillae arise and exceed the mandibles. The labium exhibits the groove for the reception of the other parts, and the oval raised marks near its extremity are the vestiges of palpi.\n\n4. Parts of the mouth of Papilio machaon.

Mr Hume was the first to point out the fallacy of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Interest), and to show that the rate of interest is not determined by the amount of the currency, but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rate of profit derived from the employment of capital. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> doubt it most frequently happens that, when a loan is made, it is made in the currency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; this, however, is really of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. There is obviously no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between one individual furnishing another with 100 bushels of corn to be repaid at the expiry of a twelvemonth by the delivery of 104 or 105 bushels, or with as much money at 4 or 5 per cent. as would have purchased the corn. Besides, it is easy to perceive that the same identical sum of money might serve to negotiate an infinity of loans. Suppose A lends to X L. 1000, which X immediately pays away to B for commodities of equal value; but B has no use for the money, and he, therefore, lends it to Y, who pays it away for commodities to C, who again lends it to Z, and so on; it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> the borrowers, X, Y, Z, have really received a loan of commodities, or capital, from the lenders, A, B, C, worth three times (and it might have been worth three hundred or three thousand times) as much as the money employed in settling the transactions. According as the supply of currency, compared with the business it has to perform, is greater or less, we are obliged to give a greater or lesser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of guineas or livres, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> notes, or assignats, for the commodities we wish to obtain. It is plainly, however, by the advantage or profit we expect to derive from the acquisition of the commodities which constitute capital, and not from the accidental, and, in this respect, unimportant circumstance of a larger or smaller number of pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or silver, or of bits of engraved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> being given for them, that the rate of interest, or the compensation given to the lender for the use of his stock, must be determined. It may perhaps be supposed, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of metallic money is increased, goldsmiths, jewellers, &c. obtain the raw material for carrying on their business with greater facility; but this is not always the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and, though it were, it would not affect the rate of interest. No coins are ever sent to the melting pot unless when the currency is either degraded or depreciated,\u2014that is, unless it be deficient in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, or relatively redundant in quantity. And it is clear that the inducement to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> or low rate of interest for loans of metallic money, which it was intended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> up into some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of manufactured goods, would depend not on the supply of such money, but on the profit to be derived from the operation,\u2014a circumstance totally unconnected with the scarcity or abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the rate of interest, at any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, depends exclusively on the supply of real disposable capital, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, machinery, raw and manufactured products, &c. compared with the power of profitably employing it. An increase of metallic money adds only very inconsiderably, and an increase of paper money adds nothing whatever to the real capital of the country, or to the\n\n---\n\n* Interet : loyer d\u2019un capital pr\u00eat\u00e9 ; ou bien, en termes plus exacts, achat des services productifs que peut rendre un capital.

It is not denied that considerable mischief and derangement must always be experienced in a highly manufacturing and commercial country like Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, when any sudden check is given to the facility with which discounts are generally obtained, or when the currency is suddenly contracted. But the frottlement and inconvenience occasioned by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the currency could only be temporary. It is impossible it could have any lasting effect on the industry of the country. We should still possess the same amount of real capital; and as neither its productive power, nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to transfer it from one individual to another, would be at all impaired, the real revenue of the state would continue as great as ever, and the same, or a greater amount of stock might be disposed of by way of loan. Money prices would certainly fall proportionally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of the currency; or, which is the same thing, the value of commodities would henceforth have to be ascertained by comparing them with a smaller number of bits of gold or paper. But, in every other respect, the business of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> would continue exactly on its former footing; and without some change in the rate of profit, on which fluctuations in the value of money have almost no effect, the rate of interest would continue invariable.\n\nMr Ricardo has set this principle in a clear and striking point of view. \"The rate of interest,\" he observes, in answer to those who had contended that it would be increased by a diminution of the discounts of the Bank of England, \"is not regulated by the rate at which the Bank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> lend, whether it be 5, 4, or 3 per cent., but by the rate of profit which can be made by the employment of capital, and which is totally independent of the quantity and of the value of money. Whether a bank lend one million, ten millions, or a hundred millions, they would not permanently alter the market rate of interest; they would alter only the value of the money which they thus issued. In one case, ten or twenty times more money might be requested to carry on the same business, than what might be required in the other. The applications to the Bank for money, then, depend on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the rate of profits that may be made by the employment of it, and the rate at which they are willing to lend it. If they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> less than the market rate of interest, there is no amount of money which they might not lend; if they charge more than that rate, none but spendthrifts and prodigals would be found to borrow of them. We accordingly find, that when the market rate of interest exceeds the rate of 5 per cent. at which the bank uniformly lend, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCOUNT\">discount</a> office is besieged with applicants for money; and, on the contrary, when the market rate is even temporarily under 5 per cent., the clerks of that office have no employment.\" (Principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Economy, 1st edit. p. 511.)\n\nIt is foreign to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this article to enter into any detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the causes which tend to elevate or depress the rate of profit. Whatever diversity of opinion may be entertained respecting them, it is abundantly evident that the rate of interest afforded for the use of borrowed capital must be proportionable to the profits which might be derived from its employment. In the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, the market rate of interest varies from 10 to 14 per cent.; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, previously to the invasion of the French in 1794, it did not exceed 2 or 3 per cent. The immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of fertile and uncultivated land in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, the lowness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>, and the absence of all restrictive regulations, naturally occasion high profits, and consequently high interest; while the sterility and limited extent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of Holland, the excessive load of taxes, laid equally on necessaries and luxuries, and the injudicious restraints imposed on various branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, by rendering it impossible to derive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> returns from capital, proportionably sink the rate of interest. Had the soil of Holland been as fertile, and taxation as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as in the United States, profits and interest would, notwithstanding the abundant supply of capital, have been equally high in the one Republic as in the other. It is not by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> amount of the stock of a country, but by the comparative facilities for its advantageous employment, that the compensation or interest which a borrower can afford for its use must always be regulated. Previous to the termination of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, the market rate of interest in this country, for sums which could not be immediately demanded, fluctuated from 5 to 12 per cent. It has since fallen to 4 or 5 per cent.; a decline which has not, certainly, been occasioned by any sudden increase of capital, but by the extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of commerce, and the consequent impossibility of investing stock so as to yield as large a profit as it did during the period when we engrossed almost the whole trade of the world.\n\nBesides, such variations as are proportionable to Rate of Interest, variations in the general and average rate of profit, and which equally affect all loans, the rate of interest must vary according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of security afforded for the repayment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the loan. No capitalist would lend on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> security of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>, and on mortgage over a valuable estate, at the same rate of interest. The extraordinary hazard of the gunpowder trade exposes the stock invested in it to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> degree of risk. It may be dissipated in an instant; and the power of the borrower to refund the capital he had borrowed annihilated for ever. A lender of money on mortgage is almost entirely relieved from such contingencies. The owner of an estate on which a loan is secured may become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKRUPT\">bankrupt</a>, but the estate itself will remain, and may be either sold or taken possession of by the lender. It is plain, therefore, that there must be a very great difference in the rate of interest paid by those whose security for the repayment of the principal is so exceedingly different. The gunpowder manufacturer, besides paying a rate, or per centage, equivalent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and average rate of interest derived from the most secure investments, would have to pay an additional rate, which, although it might not be designated by that name, would really\nconstitute a *premium* of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSURANCE\">insurance</a> proportioned to the greater risk to which the lender was exposed of losing his principal. The preferable security offered by the landholder would relieve him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of paying any considerable premium, or excess of interest, on account of risk; and, of course, he would be able to borrow at so much less than the manufacturer. We should mistake, however, if we supposed that the latter was thus placed in a comparatively disadvantageous situation. He would be completely indemnified for the greater risk to which his stock was exposed, and for the higher rate of interest which he was, in consequence, obliged to pay, by the greater *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> profits* he would derive from his business. The constantly operating principle of competition will not permit, taking every thing into account, a greater *nett profit* to be permanently derived from one department of industry than from another. But those who invest their stock in employments of more than ordinary hazard, must be able to dispose of their produce at such a price as will yield them the common and average rate of profit, besides affording a surplus adequate to insure their stock against the extra risk to which it is exposed. If this were not the case, no capitalist would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> in a state of comparative danger, and no undertakings of a hazardous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> would be entered into. Wherever there is risk, that risk must be compensated. And it may, and very frequently does, happen that the manager of a hazardous branch of industry, paying from 10 to 20 per cent. for borrowed capital, is realizing a larger *nett profit* than the landlord who has purchased an estate with money for which he only pays 3 or 4 per cent.\n\nBut, supposing the securities to be equal, capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> for *short periods*, or in such a way that the lender may obtain possession of it *at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>*, will always bring a lower rate of interest than capital lent for a considerable, or definite, period. No borrower could afford to pay so high a rate of interest for a capital of whose productive services he might be deprived in an instant, and which he could not, therefore, venture to invest in any employment from which it might not be easily withdrawn, as for a capital lent for a fixed period, especially if that period was of considerable length. But here, as in every other case, the real interests of the borrower and lender coincide. The same circumstances which prevent a borrower from giving as high a rate of interest for a loan payable on demand as if it were payable at a fixed and distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, induces the lender to rest satisfied with a smaller compensation in the one case than in the other. We wish to be able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> a complete command over our capital. No merchant would ever consent to lend his stock on mortgage. If he did, he would no longer be able to carry on his business with advantage. He would be deprived of all power of speculating; and, although this might, in many instances, be for his advantage, yet the flattering opinion which every one entertains of his own abilities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, would but seldom allow him to doubt of its being a very material disadvantage. It is by this principle that we are able to account for the comparatively low rate of interest at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a> companies, who pay the sums deposited with them on demand, and governments, whose circumstances are perfectly desperate, are able to borrow. A stockholder's mortgage,\u2014his claim on the revenue of the country,\u2014can be immediately converted into cash at the current prices. And, however much the majority of the public creditors may be impressed with a conviction of the inability of the state to discharge *all* the claims upon it, every particular individual, confident in his own good fortune, foresight, and acuteness, flatters himself with the idea that he, at least, will be able to predict the coming tempest, and that he will be able to sell out before a national bankruptcy.\n\nInstead, however, of leaving the rate of interest to be adjusted by the unfettered competition of borrowers and lenders, on the principles we have justly explained, the governments of most countries have interfered either to prohibit the taking of interest altogether, or to fix certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> which it was declared legal to exact, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that any excess over these rates was declared to be *usury*, and prohibited under the severest penalties. In the rude and unenlightened ages in which these enactments had their origin, the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, then the only species of money, were considered as uninfluenced by the same principles which regulate the value of other products. Being used both as standards whereby to ascertain the comparative value of different commodities, and as the equivalents for which they were most frequently exchanged, they acquired a factitious importance, not merely in the estimation of the vulgar, but in that of persons of the greatest discernment. The simple consideration that all buying and selling is really nothing more than the bartering of one commodity for another,\u2014of a certain quantity of corn or beef, for example, for a certain quantity of gold or silver, and vice versa, was entirely overlooked. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was gradually transferred from the money's worth to the money itself; and the wealth of states and of individuals came to be measured, not by the abundance of their disposable\n\n---\n\n*This principle is never lost sight of in bargaining for loans. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, the rate of interest was not regulated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; and it is distinctly mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors, that the average rate of interest paid by those who employed their stock in the shipping trade with the countries situated on the Euxine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> Seas, amounted, on account of the hazard of the voyage, to about 30 per cent., while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKERS\">bankers</a>, agriculturists, and others, whose security was preferable, paid only about 12 per cent.* Say, in noticing this striking fact, supposes that the 30 per cent. was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> by the voyage; and that, as two voyages to the Crimea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, might be made annually, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a>* interest really amounted at Athens to 60 per cent. There does not, however, appear to be the least ground for this assertion. It is the average annual rate of interest that is always spoken of.\u2014(Travels of Anacharsis, Vol. IV. p. 368, Eng. trans.; De Pauw, Recherches sur les Grecs, Tom. I. p. 287; Say, Tom. II. p. 132.)\nproduce,\u2014by the quantity or value of the commodities with which they could afford to purchase the precious metals,\u2014but by the quantity of these metals actually in their possession. Because it sometimes happened that the holders of ordinary commodities were unable easily to dispose of them at any price, while money was always sure to find a ready and advantageous market, it was considered as something mysterious,\u2014as a real merchandise par excellence.\n\nWe cannot, therefore, be surprised at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to which the erroneous opinions entertained respecting it necessarily led; or that efforts should have been made to protect the interests of those who were unprovided with so powerful an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, from becoming a prey to the encroachments of their more fortunate neighbours. Every individual was allowed freely to dispose of his corn, cattle, land, &c.; but it was imagined there was something peculiar in money, and that the desire to obtain it was so great, that, unless the lenders were restrained in their demands, they would, by taking advantage of the necessities of the borrowers, infallibly ruin them, and engross the whole property of the country.\n\nAnother source of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> against stipulating for interest must be sought for in the dislike so universally entertained in remote ages to accumulation. There can be no accumulation without economy,\u2014without a saving of income,\u2014and this was then not only considered as indicative of a sordid and avaricious disposition, but as being positively hurtful. Before the nature and functions of capital were properly understood, it was believed it could not be increased otherwise than by injuriously abstracting a portion of the national revenue, and that any advantage it might give to the proprietor, must have been obtained at the public expense. It did not occur to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, that an individual who, by his economy, has accumulated stock, has really added to the wealth of the state, without diminishing that of others; nor were they aware that this stock, when afterwards expended, as is almost always the case, in the support of productive industry, would afford the means of producing an increased income. But, reckoning as they did, the savings of individuals as so much withdrawn from the public income, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> enough that they should endeavour to limit the advantage to be derived from their employment.\n\nMuch, also, of the prejudice against bargaining for interest, so prevalent in the middle ages, may be traced to the authority of some texts of scripture, which were understood entirely to prohibit its exactation. It has, however, been shown, that these texts will not really bear this interpretation; but, supposing they had, nothing, it is plain, could be more absurd than to consider the municipal regulations of a people placed in such peculiar circumstances as the Jews, as general and fixed principles, applicable in all ages and countries.\n\nBut, whatever may have been the causes of the efforts so generally made to regulate and limit the rate of interest, it is certain that, far from succeeding in their object, they have had a precisely opposite effect. Should a borrower find it for his advantage to offer 6, 7, or 8 per cent. for a loan\u2014and, unless it were for his advantage, nothing could possibly induce him to make such an offer\u2014what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> to interfere, and to prohibit the lender from receiving, and the borrower from paying, more than 4 or 5 per cent.? Such an interference is not only uncalled for and unnecessary, but it is, in the highest degree, prejudicial. Restrictive laws, instead of reducing, have uniformly contributed to raise the rate of interest. Nor is this any thing but what might have been foreseen and expected. It is plain no law can be so framed as to prevent a borrower from offering a higher rate of interest than what is fixed by statute; and, if the lender had implicit confidence in the secrecy and solvency of the borrower, he might accommodate him with the sum wanted, without requiring any additional interest or premium of insurance, because of the danger of entering into what the law declares to be an illegal transaction: but this must be a very rare case. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">Gratitude</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of benefits received, are, unfortunately, when they come into contact with self-interest, but slender securities for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> conduct. Numberless unforeseen events occur to weaken and dissolve the best cemented friendships; and a transaction of this kind would undoubtedly afford an additional source of jealousies and divisions. In such matters, indeed, men are more than usually sharp-sighted, and are very little disposed to trust to moral guarantees for the security of their property. But neither the threatenings of the law, nor the powerful inducement which it holds out to dishonest debtors to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> their engagements, and treacherously to recede from the stipulations to which they had agreed, have been able to prevent, or even greatly to lessen, what are termedurious bargains. Their only effect has been, to oblige the lender to demand, and the borrower to bind himself to pay, a higher rate of interest than would otherwise have been required. A bargain for more than the statute rate of interest being declared illegal, the lender is thus exposed to an additional risk. But no person will gratuitously place his fortune in a situation of comparative hazard: and, therefore, the sum necessary to cover this risk, must be proportioned to the greater or less anxiety on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to prevent and punish such bargains; or, in other words, the rate of interest is invariably increased according as the laws intended to reduce it become more severe, and diminished according as they are relaxed!\n\nThus a capitalist might be inclined to lend a sum at 6 or 7 per cent.; but, as the law declares that any individual who shall stipulate for more than 5 per cent. shall, if detected, forfeit three times the principal, it is clear, provided there was no method of defeating this statute, that there must be an end of all borrowing, except when the market rate of interest was below the statutory rate. Whenever it was above that rate, no person would be able to obtain a single farthing by way of loan. There could, then, be no transference of capital. It would continue locked up in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and the national prosperity and welfare would, in consequence, suffer severely. Luckily, however, the mutual interest and ingenuity of borrowers and lenders have always proved an overmatch for the enactments of the law.\nThese have done nothing but fetter the transference of stock, and force the borrowers to pay a higher rate of interest for it. What might have been borrowed at 6 per cent., had there been no hazard from anti-usurious statutes, is, on account of that hazard, raised to perhaps 8 or 10 per cent.; and, what is still worse, a contempt for the institutions of society, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of carrying on business in a secret and underhand manner, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>. The odium which attaches to a positively pernicious regulation weakens the respect which would otherwise be felt for those which are acknowledged to be advantageous; and that spirit of frankness, openness, and sincerity, which, wherever it predominates, is so highly valuable, is cramped in its development, or altogether supplanted, by duplicity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a>, and cunning.\n\nThese conclusions do not rest on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> only, but are supported by a constant and uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. At Rome, during the period of the Republic, the ordinary rate of interest was excessively high. The debtors, or plebeians, were every now and then threatening to deprive their creditors, who were generally of the patrician order, not only of the interest of their capital, but of the principal itself. Repeated instances occurred to show that these were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> empty threats; and the patricians were, therefore, obliged to indemnify themselves, by means of a corresponding premium, for the risks to which they were exposed. \"Des continuels changements,\" says Montesquieu, \"soit par des loix, soit par des plebiscites, naturaliserent \u00e0 Rome l'usure; car les creanciers, voyant le peuple leur debiteur, leur legislateur, et leur juge, neurent plus de confiance dans les contrats. Le peuple, comme un debiteur deficite, ne tentoit \u00e0 lui pr\u00eater que par des gros profits; d'autant plus que, si les loix ne venoient que de tems en tems, les plaintes du peuple etoient continuelles, et intimidoient toujours les creanciers. Cela fit que tous les moyens honn\u00eates de pr\u00eater et d'emprunter furent abolis \u00e0 Rome, et qu'une usure affreuse, toujours foudroy\u00e9e, et toujours renaissante, s'y etabl\u00eet. Le mal venoient de ce que les choses n'avoient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 menag\u00e9es. Les loix extremes dans le bien font na\u00eetre le mal extr\u00eame: il fallut payer pour le pr\u00eat de l'argent, et pour le danger des peines de la loi.\" (Esprit des Loix, Liv. XXII. chap. 21.)\n\nIn Mahometan countries, notwithstanding the positive prohibition in the Coran, the ordinary rate of interest is at least ten or twenty times as high as its ordinary rate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. \"L'usure augmente dans les pays Mahometans \u00e0 proportion de la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la defense: le pr\u00eateur s'indemnise du peril de la contravention.\" (Esprit des Loix, Liv. XXI. chap. 19.)\n\nDuring the middle ages, the average rate of profit in the middle ages could not be much higher than at present: \"But the clamour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> raised against those who took interest for the use of money was so violent, that they were obliged to charge it much higher than the natural price, which, if it had been let alone, would have found its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, in order to compensate for the opprobrium, and frequently the plunder, which they suffered; and hence the usual rate of interest was what we should now call most exorbitant and scandalous usury.\" (Macpherson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Commerce, Vol. I. p. 400.) The extraordinary risks to which lenders were exposed rendered the premium of insurance on all sorts of capital excessively high; for, of the 50, and even 100 per cent., which borrowers then frequently engaged to pay as interest, not more than 8 or 10 per cent. can properly be said to have been given for the productive services of capital. The rest must be considered as a bonus, to compensate the lender for the hazard he encountered of losing the principal itself.\n\nIn France the rate of interest was fixed at 5 per cent. so early as 1665; and this, a few short intervals only excepted, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the legal rate until the Revolution. Laverdy, in 1766, reduced it from 5 to 4 per cent. Instead, however, of the market rate being proportionably reduced, it was raised from 5 to 6 per cent. Previously to the promulgation of the edict loans might have been obtained on good security at 5 per cent.; but an additional per cent. was now required to cover the risk of illegality. This caused the speedy abandonment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>. (Storch, Trait\u00e9 d'Economie Politique, Tome III. p. 187.)\n\nThe same thing happened in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a> in 1786, when the Empress Catherine reduced the legal rate of interest from 6 per cent. to 5. Hitherto, says Storch (in loco citato), those who had good security to offer, were able to borrow at 6 per cent.; but henceforth they had to pay 7 per cent. or upwards. And such will be found to have been invariably the case wherever governments have interfered to reduce the statutory below the market rate of interest.\n\nFrom the earliest period of the history of England <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the reign of Henry VIII., the taking of interest was absolutely forbidden to all persons within the realm except Jews and foreigners; who, nevertheless, were frequently plundered for the sake of enriching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>, under the miserable\n\n* It is impossible to form any very accurate estimate of the rate of profit in the middle ages, yet several striking facts may be adduced in support of the opinion advanced in the text. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, in 1228, the interest of money was fixed by law at 12\u00bd per cent. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, the Republic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a> paid only from 7 to 10 per cent. to her creditors; and the average discount on good bills at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, in 1435, is stated to have been about 10 per cent. But while the rate of interest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and Catalonia, where a considerable degree of freedom was allowed to the parties concerned in bargaining for a loan, was thus comparatively moderate, it was, in despite of its total prohibition, incomparably higher in France and England. Matthew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> mentions, that, in the reign of Henry III., the debtor paid 10 per cent. every two months; and this, though absolutely impossible as a general practice, may not have been very far from the average interest charged on the few loans that were then contracted for.\u2014(Hallam's History of the Middle Ages, Vol. III. p. 402.)\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of punishing them for what were then called their \"hellish extortions.\" The disorders occasioned by this ruinous interference on the part of Government at length became so obvious, that, notwithstanding the powerful prejudices to the contrary, a statute was passed in 1546 (37th Hen. VIII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 7.), legalizing the taking of interest to the extent of 10 per cent. per annum; and this, because, as is recited in the words of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, the statutes prohibiting interest altogether have so little force, that little or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> hath ensued to the offenders.\" In the reign of Edward VI. the horror against taking interest seems to have revived in full force; for, in 1552, the taking of any interest was again prohibited \"as a vice most odious and detestable,\" and \"contrary to the word of God.\" But, in spite of this tremendous denunciation, the ordinary rate of interest, instead of being reduced, immediately rose to 14 per cent.; and continued at this rate, until, in 1571, an act was passed (19th Eliz. cap. 8), repealing the act of Edward VI., and reviving the act of Henry VIII., allowing 10 per cent. interest. In the preamble to this act, it is stated, \"that the prohibiting act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> Edward VI. had not done so much good as was hoped for; but that rather the vice of usury hath much more exceedingly abounded, to the utter undoing of many gentlemen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, occupiers, and others, and to the importable hurt of the commonwealth.\" This salutary statute was opposed, even by those who, it might have been expected, would have been among the first to emancipate themselves from the prejudices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, with all the violence of ignorant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>. Dr John Wilson, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> famous in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and celebrated for the extent and solidity of his learning, stated, in his place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, that \"it was not the amount of the interest taken that constituted the crime; but that all lending for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>, be it ever so little, was wickedness before God and man, and a damnable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> in itself, and that there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> in this vice any more than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> or theft!\" In order to quiet the consciences of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENCH\">Bench</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">Bishops</a>, a clause was actually inserted, declaring all usury to have been forbidden by the law of God, and to be, in its nature, sin, and detestable! When first enacted, this statute was limited to a period of five years; but, \"forasmuch as it was by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> and experience found to be very necessary and profitable for the commonwealth of this realm,\" it was, in the same reign, made perpetual. (39th Eliz. cap. 18.)\n\nIn the 21st of James I. the legal rate of interest was reduced to 8 per cent., by an act to continue for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years only, but which was made perpetual in the succeeding reign. (3d Car. I. cap. 4.) During the commonwealth, the legal rate of interest was reduced to 6 per cent.; a reduction which was afterwards confirmed by the act 12th Car. II. And, finally, in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, a statute (12th Anne, cap. 16) was framed, reducing the rate of interest to 5 per cent., at which it now stands.\n\nIn the preamble to this statute, it is stated, that, \"whereas the reducing of interest to ten, and from thence to eight, and thence to six in the hundred, hath from time to time, by experience, been found very beneficial to the advancement of trade and the improvement of lands; it is become absolutely necessary to reduce the high rate of interest of 6 per cent. to a nearer proportion to the interest allowed for money in foreign states.\" It was for these reasons enacted, that all bargains or contracts, stipulating for a higher rate of interest than 5 per cent., should be utterly void. And \"that all persons who should after that time receive, by means of any corrupt bargain, loan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, chevizance, or interest of any wares, merchandise, or other thing whatever, or by any deceitful way or means, or by any covin, engine, or deceitful conveyance for the forbearing or giving day of payment, for one whole year for their money or other thing, above the sum of L.5 for L.100 for a year, should forfeit, for every such offence, the triple value of the monies or other things so lent, bargained,\" &c.\n\nIn Scotland, previously to the Reformation, no laws regulating interest could be legally exacted for money. But, during this great event, by weakening the force of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> prejudices, which had chiefly dictated the laws prohibiting interest, occasioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of sounder opinions on the subject, and led to the enactment of the statute of 1587 (11th Parl. Jac. VI. cap. 52), which legalized the taking of interest to the extent of ten per cent. In 1633 the legal rate was reduced to eight per cent., and, in 1661, to six per cent. The statute of Queen Anne, reducing the rate of interest to 5 per cent., extended to both kingdoms.\n\nThe statutes prohibiting the taking of interest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> were not repealed until 1635, when, by the statute 10th Car. I. cap. 22, liberty was given to stipulate for interest to the extent of ten per cent. In 1704 this rate was reduced to eight per cent.; in 1722 it was reduced to seven per cent.; and, in 1732, it was further reduced to six per cent., at which it has since continued fixed.\n\nIt has been observed by Dr Smith, that the different statutory regulations, reducing the rate of interest in England, were made with great propriety. Instead of preceding, they followed the fall which was gradually taking place in the market rate of interest; and, therefore, did not contribute, as they otherwise must have done, to raise the rate which they were intended to reduce. Sir Josiah Child, whose celebrated Treatise, recommending a reduction of interest to four per cent. was published about 1670, states positively, that the goldsmiths in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, who then acted as bankers, could obtain as much money as they pleased, upon their servants' notes only, at 4\u00bd per cent. The supposed insecurity of the revolutionary establishment, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of the practice of funding, occasioned the payment of a high rate of interest for a considerable portion of the sums borrowed by the public in the reigns of William III. and Anne; but private persons, of undoubted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, could then borrow at less than 5 per cent. During the reign of George II. the market rate of interest fluctuated from 3 to 4 and 4\u00bd per cent.*\n\n* On the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1752, the three per cents. brought the highest price they have hitherto reached.\nDr Smith mentions, that the increased means of profitably investing capital acquired during the war which terminated in 1763, raised the market rate of interest, subsequently to the peace of Paris, to a level with the statutory rate, or perhaps higher. But this rise was only temporary, and it was not until the late war that any very material or general inconvenience was found to result from the limitation of the rate of interest to 5 per cent.\n\nIt is necessary, however, to observe, that this remark applies exclusively to the loans negotiated by individuals who could offer unexceptionable security; for, ever since the passing of the act 1714, persons engaged in employments of more than ordinary hazard, whose character for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and punctuality did not stand high, or who could only offer inferior security, were unable to borrow at 5 per cent., and have in consequence been compelled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to a variety of schemes for defeating and evading the enactments in the statute. The most common device was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of an annuity. Thus, supposing an individual whose personal credit was not good, and who had only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIVERY\">livery</a> of an estate to give in security, wanted to borrow any given sum, he sold an annuity to the lender sufficient to pay the interest stipulated for, which, because of the risks and odium attending such transactions, was always higher than the market rate, and also to pay the premium necessary to insure payment of the principal on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the borrower. It is curious to observe, that although the sale of an irredeemable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> annuity, at a rate exceeding legal interest, was not reckoned fraudulent or usurious; yet so late as 1743, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Hardwicke held, that in their less exceptionable form, or when they were redeemable, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a> could only be looked upon as an evasion of the statute of usury, and a loan of money. But the extreme inexpediency of this distinction soon became obvious, and the law on this subject is now entirely changed. The greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the traffic in annuities, and the advantage of giving as much publicity as possible to such transactions, led to various Parliamentary inquiries and regulations respecting them in the early part of the reign of his late Majesty. The consequence has been, that irredeemable annuities are now nearly unknown, and that the sale of a redeemable annuity cannot be impeached, although it should appear on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the deeds that the lender had secured the principal by effecting an assurance of the borrower's life.\u2014(Pamphleteer, Vol. VIII. p. 280.)\n\nDuring the greater part of the late war, however, the usury laws operated not to the prejudice of one, but of all classes of borrowers. The extent of the loans, the high rate of interest given by the state, the facility of selling out of the funds, the regularity with which the dividends were paid, and the temptations arising from the fluctuations in the price of funded property, diverted so large a proportion of the floating capital of the country into the coffers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>, as to render it next to impossible for a private individual to borrow at the legal rate of interest, except from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> of public companies, or through the influence of circumstances of a very peculiar nature. The proprietors of unencumbered freehold estates, of which they had the absolute disposal, were almost universally obliged to resort to those destructive expedients which had formerly been the resource only of spendthrifts, and persons in the most desperate circumstances. Annuities were not unfrequently granted for the term of several lives, at the rate of 12, 14, 15, and even 20 per cent., exclusive of the premium of insurance on the lives of the persons named in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of the annuities. Mr Onslow, in his speech on the usury laws, 23d May 1816, mentions that he knew the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> possessed of a very large estate in fee-simple, who had been compelled to grant an annuity for four lives (and the survivor of them), named by the grantee for eight years' purchase!\n\nThe Report of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> on the Usury Laws, House of Commons, laid before the House of Commons in 1818, contains Commons' much valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, establishing the impolicy and the pernicious effects of these laws, in the clearest manner. Mr Sugden, a gentleman very extensively concerned in the management of landed property, stated, that when the market rate of interest rose above the legal rate, the landed proprietor was compelled to resort to some shift to evade the usury laws. For this purpose, Mr Sugden informed the Committee he had \"known annuities granted for three lives at 10 per cent. upon fee-simple estates, unencumbered, and of great annual value, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. He had also known annuities granted for four lives, and more would have been added but for the danger of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> setting aside the transaction on account of the inadequacy of the consideration\u2014Latterly many annuities were granted for a term of years certain, not depending upon lives.\" On being asked whether, if there were no laws limiting the rate of interest, better terms could or could not have been obtained, Mr Sugden answered, \"I am decidedly of opinion that better terms could have been obtained, for there is a stigma which attaches to men who lend money upon annuities, that drives all respectable men out of the market. Some leading\n\nnamely, 106\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) per cent. On the 20th September 1797, the day on which the failure of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALMSBURY\">Malmsbury</a>'s attempt to negotiate with the French Republic transpired, consols fell to 47\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), being the lowest price at which they have ever been sold.\n\n* Considerations on the Rate of Interest, by E. B. Sugden, Esq. Pamphleteer, Vol. VIII. p. 278.\n\n\u2020 By the act 53d Geo. III. cap. 141, it is enacted, \"That a memorial setting forth the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of every deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance, whereby an annuity or rent-charge shall be granted for one or more life or lives, or for a certain number of years, the names of all the witnesses, and of all the parties thereto, the sum given for the security, and the amount of the annuity itself, shall be registered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHANCERY\">Chancery</a>.\" This act only applies to England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>.\nmen did latterly embark in such transactions, but I never knew a man of reputation in my own profession lend money in such a manner, although we have the best means of ascertaining the safest securities, and of obtaining the best terms. In all loans, two solicitors are invariably concerned, one for the borrower and one for the lender; and although the borrower always pays the expense of the securities, yet a regular professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> is invariably made out; whereas, in the case of an annuity, although it is in strictness a loan, only one solicitor is employed, and he never makes out a regular bill, but charges what is termed a lumping sum, for all his expence and trouble in the transaction.\"\u2014And in another place Mr Sugden observes, \"The temptation on the part of a solicitor to lend money upon annuities is very strong, because, without any check upon his charges, he demands whatever sum he pleases, and he takes care that it is instantly paid; for in no instance is the borrower allowed to leave the room until he has paid the solicitor's charge.\" \"Nothing,\" Mr Sugden justly adds, \"short of a repeal of the usury laws, can put a stop to the abuses which attend grants of annuities; they strongly encourage a spirit of gambling, for, as the repayment of the money lent cannot be enforced, and the annuity is granted upon a contingency, the borrower too frequently neglects to provide for the payment of the loan, and trusts to chance for the determination of the annuity.\"\n\n\"The laws against usury,\" says Mr Holland, partner of the house of Baring, Brothers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, and one of the best informed merchants in the country, \"drive men in distress, or in want of money, to much more disastrous modes of raising it than they would adopt if no usury laws existed. The landowner requires capital to increase his live stock, or improve his land, or for any other purpose, at a period when the government is borrowing money at above 5 per cent., or when the funds give a greater interest than 5 per cent.; no one will then lend to the landowner, because his money is worth more to him than the law allows him to take; the landowner must, therefore, either give up his improvements, or borrow money on annuity interests, on much more disadvantageous terms than he could have done, if no law existed against usury. The man in trade, in want of money for an unexpected demand, or disappointed in his returns, must fulfil his engagements, or forfeit his credit. He might have borrowed money at 6 per cent., but the law allows no one to lend it to him, and he must sell some of the commodity he holds at a reduced price, in order to meet his engagements. For example, he holds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> which is worth 80s.; but he is compelled to sell it immediately for 70s. to the man who will give him cash for it, and thus actually borrows money at 12\u00bd per cent., which, had the law allowed him, he might have borrowed from a money dealer at 6 per cent. It is known to every merchant, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of this kind are common occurrences in every commercial town, and more especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. A man in distress for money, pays more interest, owing to the usury laws, than he would if no such laws existed; because now he is obliged to go to some of the disreputable money lenders to borrow, as he knows the respectable money lender will not break the laws of his country. The disreputable money lender knows that he has the ordinary risk of his debtor to incur in lending his money, and he has further to encounter the penalty of the law, for both of which risks the borrower must pay. If no usury laws existed, in common cases, and where a person is respectable, he might obtain a loan from the respectable money lender, who would then only have to calculate his ordinary risk, and the compensation for the use of his money.\"\n\nIn every part of the Appendix to the Report, we meet with equally conclusive evidence of the pernicious effects of the laws restraining the rate of interest. And the committee admitted the full force of this evidence, by agreeing to the following resolutions: 1st, \"That it is the opinion of this committee, that the laws regulating or restraining the rate of interest have been extensively evaded, and have failed of the effect of imposing a maximum on such rate; and that, of late years, from the constant excess of the market rate of interest above the rate limited by law, they have added to the expence incurred by borrowers on real security, and that such borrowers have been compelled to resort to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of granting annuities on lives; a mode which has been made a cover for obtaining a higher rate of interest than the rate limited by law, and has farther subjected the borrowers to enormous charges, or forced them to make very disadvantageous sales of their estates. 2d, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of such laws, as applicable to the transactions of commerce as at present carried on, have been attended with much uncertainty, as to the legality of many transactions of frequent occurrence, and consequently been productive of much embarrassment and litigation. 3d, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the present period, when the market rate of interest is below the legal rate, affords an opportunity peculiarly favourable for the repeal of the said laws.\"\n\nIn spite, however, of the recommendation of the committee, and of the clear and satisfactory nature of the evidence on which it is founded, the bill which Mr Onslow introduced for a repeal of the usury laws has been withdrawn; and we regret to have to add, that the popular prejudice on this subject is still so strong, and the progress of science so slow, that there does not seem much reason to expect that this desirable measure will be speedily effected.\n\nIt is most absurdly supposed, that, were the laws limiting the rate of interest repealed, every individual who has capital to lend, would henceforth indulge in all those mean and disgraceful practices which at present characterize the lowest class of money brokers. But it might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as reasonably be supposed, that were country gentlemen allowed to sell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, they would immediately become addicted to all the vices of the poacher! The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, that if the rate of interest was left to be adjusted by the unrestricted competition of the parties, there would be almost no employment for the inferior class of money dealers. Except when the market rate of interest is below the legal rate, the usury laws prevent all persons, whose credit is not extremely good,\nfrom obtaining loans from capitalists of the highest character, and force them to have recourse to those who are less scrupulous. Supposing the market rate of interest to be 6 or 7 per cent., an individual, in ordinary good credit, might, were the usury laws abolished, easily obtain a loan at that rate. But the law having declared, that no more than 5 per cent. shall be taken, and consequently having affixed a species of stigma to those lenders who bargain for a higher rate, necessarily excludes the rich and more respectable capitalists from the market, and obliges borrowers to resort to those of an inferior character, who, in addition to the premium for the risk incurred by entering into an illegal transaction, must receive an indemnification for the odium which, in such cases, always attaches to the lender. It is idle and ridiculous to attempt to secure individuals against the risk of imposition in pecuniary, more than in any other species of transactions. But, although the object were really desirable, it could not possibly be obtained by such inadequate means. The usury laws <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> the very mischief they are intended to suppress. Far from diminishing, they most unquestionably multiply usurious transactions in a tenfold proportion, and powerfully aggravate all the evils they were designed either to mitigate or remove.\n\nNothing can be more unreasonable, or more entirely unfounded, than the clamour that has been set up against usurers, as money lenders are sometimes termed, because of their exacting a higher rate of interest than ordinary from prodigals and spendthrifts. This surely is the most proper and efficient check that can be put upon the thoughtless or unprincipled extravagance of such persons. Supposing the security of a prodigal and of an industrious man to be nearly equal, and this can scarcely ever be the case, does not the capitalist, who would lend to the latter at a lower rate of interest than he would lend to the former, confer a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> on his country? Does he not prevent those funds which ought to be employed in supporting useful labour, and in adding to the real wealth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, from being wasted in ridiculous extravagances or boisterous dissipation?\n\nBut, perhaps, we shall be told, that this is mistaking the object of the usury laws\u2014that they were not intended to force capitalists to lend to spendthrifts at the same rate of interest as to industrious persons, but to protect the prodigal and unwary from the extortion of usurers, by declaring any stipulation between them for more than a given rate of interest to be null and void. But why all this solicitude about the least valuable class of society? Why fetter and restrict the free circulation of capital among those who would turn it to the best account, lest any portion of it might chance to fall into the hands of those who would squander it away? If the prevention of prodigality be an object of sufficient importance to justify the interference of the Legislator, why not at once put the prodigal under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERDICT\">interdict</a>? This is the only way in which it is possible to restrict him. It is not so much by borrowing money at high interest, as by contracting debts to merchants, on whose charge there is no check, that spendthrifts generally run through their fortunes. Mr Bentham has justly observed, that so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as a man is looked upon as one who will pay, he can much easier get the goods he wants than he could the money to buy them with, though he were content to give for it twice or thrice the ordinary rate of interest. How ridiculous is it, then, to stimulate this natural facility of purchasing, to permit prodigals to borrow (for it is really borrowing) the largest supplies of food, clothes, &c. at 20, 30, or even 100 per cent. interest, at the same time that we inflict a real injury on every other class of society, rather than permit them to borrow the smallest supply of money at more than 5 per cent.! Instead of being of any service, this restriction is evidently injurious to the prodigal. It narrows his choice, and drives him from a market which might have proved much less disadvantageous, to one in which no disgrace attaches to the exaction of the most exorbitant interest, and where he can scarcely escape being ruined.\n\nNeither is the outcry raised against capitalists for taking advantage of the necessities of industrious individuals one whit better founded than that which is raised against them for taking advantage of the extravagant and thoughtless disposition of the prodigal or the simple. According as a person has a character for sobriety, and for punctuality in making his engagements, and according to the presumed state of his affairs at the time, so will he be able to borrow. To say that a capitalist took advantage of the necessities of any individual, is only saying that he refused to lend to a person in suspicious or necessitous circumstances, at the same rate of interest he would have done had he been in high credit; or, which is the same thing, had there been no risk of losing the principal; and had he not acted in this manner, should we not have justly considered him as a fool or a madman?\n\nBut, as has been already shown, whatever may be the extortion of lenders, the usury laws afford no means of checking it; on the contrary, they compel the borrowers to pay, over and above the common rate of interest, a premium sufficient to indemnify the lender for the risk and odium incurred in breaking them! They attempt to remedy what is not an evil, and what, consequently, ought not to be interfered with; and in doing this they necessarily create a real grievance. What should we have thought of an act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> to compel the underwriters to insure a gunpowder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> warehouse on the same terms? Yet this would not have been in any respect more absurd than to enact that the same rate of interest should be charged on capital lent to those whose security is widely different.\n\nLuckily we are not left to infer from general principles, however well established, the many advantages, no Usury Laws in that would result from a repeal of the laws limiting the rate of interest. The case of Holland furnishes a practical and striking proof of the correctness of the theory we have been endeavouring to establish. It is an undoubted fact, that the rate of interest has been, for a very long period, lower in Holland than in any other country in Europe, and yet Holland is the only country in which usury laws are altogether\nunknown,\u2014where capitalists are allowed to demand, and borrowers to pay, any rate of interest.* Notwithstanding all the violent changes of the government, and the extraordinary derangement of her financial concerns in the course of the last twenty years, the rate of interest in Holland has continued comparatively steady. During the whole of that period, persons who could offer unexceptionable security have been able to borrow at from 3 to 5\u00bd per cent.; nor has the average rate of interest charged on capital, advanced on the worst species of security, ever exceeded 6 or 7 per cent., except when the government was negotiating a forced loan.\u2020 But, in this country, where the law declares that no more than 5 per cent. shall be taken, the rate of interest for capital advanced on the best landed security has, in the same period, varied from 5 to 16 or 17 per cent., or five times as much as in Holland. Surely this ought to put to rest all doubts as to the impolicy and the inefficiency of the usury laws.\n\nIn France the usury laws were abolished at the Revolution; and it is distinctly stated, that their abolition was not attended by any rise of interest. (Storch, \u00c9conomie Politique, Tome III. p. 187.) According to the Code <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NAPOLEON\">Napoleon</a> only 6 per cent. interest is allowed to be taken in commercial affairs, and 5 per cent. when money is advanced on the security of real property. There is not, however, any difficulty in evading this law. The method, resorted to for this purpose, is to give a bonus before completing the transaction, or, which is the same thing, to frame the obligation for the debt for a larger sum than was really advanced by the lender. None of the parties, particularly interested, can be called to swear to the fact of such a bonus being given; so that the transaction is unimpeachable, unless a third party, who was privy to the settling of the affair, can be produced as a witness. The Bank of France never discounts at a higher rate of interest than 5 per cent., but sometimes at a lower rate.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMBURG\">Hamburg</a> the rate of interest is quite unrestricted; or, if there be a written law restraining it, it has become altogether obsolete. The rate, therefore, varies according to circumstances. Occasionally it has been at 7, 8, and even 10 per cent.; and, in 1799, a period of great mercantile embarrassment and insecurity, it was as high as 14 per cent. Generally, however, the rate of discount on good bills does not exceed 4 or 5 per cent. (Report on Usury Laws, p. 46.)\n\nIn Russia the legal rate of interest is 6 per cent. But, as Russia is a country capable of much improvement, and where there are very great facilities for the advantageous employment of capital, the market rate of interest is invariably higher than the statute rate, and the law is as constantly as it is easily evaded. (Ibid. and Storch, Tome III. p. 207.)\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIESTE\">Trieste</a>, and throughout the Austrian empire in general, the usual rate of interest is fixed by law at 6 per cent.; but capital can seldom be obtained for less than 8 or 10 per cent. (See Report ubi supra.)\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEGHORN\">Leghorn</a> the ordinary rate of interest is 3\u00bd per cent. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, or 6 per cent. per annum; but there is no law to prevent the taking of a higher rate. (Ibid.)\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> the ordinary rate of interest is 6 per cent.; but no law exists against taking a higher rate, and it seldom falls below 5, or rises above 7 per cent. (Ibid.)\n\nIn the United States legal interest is fixed at 6 per cent.; but the market rate fluctuates from 10 to 12 per cent. Efforts, Mr Birkbeck informs us, are now making in various parts of the Union, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Carolina, to do away the\n\n---\n\n* Strictly speaking, this applies only to the state of Holland previously to the Revolution in 1795.

Is it not the extreme of folly, that, while an industrious manufacturer, or agriculturist, is prevented from giving more than 5 per cent. for capital, which he might be able to invest so as to yield 10 or 12 per cent., Government should be allowed to borrow at 6, 8, 10, or 20 per cent.? What is this but holding out a bait to loan-mongers; and causing the capital of the country to flow with an accelerated and unnatural velocity into the Treasury? Nothing surely can be more impolitic than this. If we are to have usury laws, they ought to operate alike on every class of borrowers; and, considering the superior attractions which the facility of repossessing the principal gives to the investment of capital in the funds, the rate of interest at which Government should be allowed to borrow, should be less than the rate at which private individuals might borrow.\n\nWe trust, however, that we have said enough to show the inexpediency and the pernicious tendency of all such regulations. If a landlord is to be allowed to take the highest rent he can get offered for his land\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> the highest price for his raw produce\u2014a manufacturer for his goods\u2014why should a capitalist be restricted and fettered in the employment of his stock? Every principle of natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> political expediency, is outraged by such a distinction.\n\nSo long as the market rate of interest continued higher than the statutory rate, it cannot be doubted that considerable inconvenience would have resulted from any sudden abolition of the usury laws. It is certain, indeed, that this inconvenience would have been very speedily compensated by the check which the abolition would have given to the traffic in annuities, and by the easier circulation and more advantageous distribution of capital. Now, however, when the market is fallen below the statutory rate of interest, no inconvenience could attend their repeal. It could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to any demand for payment of borrowed money, for no individual would require payment of what he could not lend to greater advantage. But, while their repeal would be in no respect disadvantageous, it would enable those who are engaged in employments of more than ordinary hazard, to procure adequate supplies of stock on more favourable terms; and it would also secure us against the risk of future mischief should the market again rise above the legal rate of interest. It is unnecessary, however, to urge the immediate repeal of the usury laws. We think it quite visionary to apprehend any danger from the instant application of a sponge to the whole of the anti-usurious statutes, but it is enough if they are repealed gradually. To avoid exciting any alarm in the minds of the most timid, the rate at which capital may be legally lent at interest might be annually raised one, or one-half per cent., until the rate had been extended to 8 or 10 per cent., when it is clear every restrictive regulation might be abolished, without the possibility of the smallest derangement happening in consequence.\n\nWere the usury laws abolished, it would be proper to frame a statute which should fix the interest to be paid in those cases in which no previous agreement had been made respecting it. But as, in cases of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, there is very frequently considerable doubt whether it was the intention of the parties at the time the transaction took place, that any interest should be charged; it would be proper to give the borrower the full benefit of this doubt, by fixing the rate payable in such cases at the lowest market rate.\n\nBefore concluding we may remark, that, until the laws regulating the rate of profit and the increase of some writers on the subject of a low wealth and commercial prosperity of Holland was invariably appealed to as a practical proof of the advantages of a low rate of interest. But Sir Josiah Child, and those who have insisted so much on this example, forget that the lowness of interest in Holland was the necessary effect of the circumstances in which that country was placed,\u2014of the lowness of profits, caused by the oppressiveness of taxation, and the deficient supply of fertile soil, and not of any interference on the part of the Government. Neither was this lowness of interest any advantage, but a positive disadvantage. A country, whose average rate of profit, and consequently of interest, has been reduced considerably below the level of surrounding nations, may, notwithstanding, abound in wealth, and be possessed of an immense capital; but it would be the height of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> to suppose, that this reduction of profits and interest could have facilitated their accumulation. Capital cannot be accumulated otherwise than by a saving of income; and wherever incomes are large, and this will always be the case where the rate of profit is comparatively high, there must be a proportionally increased facility of gratifying the prevalent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for accumulation. The case of Holland, far from contradicting, furnishes a striking example of the truth of this principle. Sir William Temple mentions, that her trade was rather on the decline in 1670; and the large capital of which she was then in possession had been accumulated previously to her wars with Cromwell, and when the rate of profit was much higher than at any subsequent period. Low profits are a certain proof that society has become clogged in its progress. They show, that it is approaching, if it has not already reached, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> state, and that, unless measures can be devised for relieving the pressure on the resources of the state, it will be thrown back in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of improvement, and outstripped by its neighbours. The rate of profit, and the rate of interest, are ordinarily twice as high in the United States as in Great Britain or France, and it is to this that the more rapid advancement of the former in wealth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> is entirely to be ascribed. High profits, it is true, may not, in every instance, be accompanied by a great degree of prosperity; for, a despotic government, or the want of sufficient protection, may paralyze all the efforts of those who are otherwise placed in the most favourable circumstances for the accumulation of wealth. But, if the\ngovernment be equally liberal, and if property be equally well secured, the degree of national prosperity will be correspondent to the rate of profit. The demand for labour, or, which is, in effect, the same thing, the funds for supporting the largest and most valuable portion of society, increase or diminish in exact proportion to the increase or diminution of profits. Wherever they are high, the labourer is well paid, and the society rapidly augments both its population and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>; on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, wherever they are low, the demand for labour is proportionally reduced, and the progress of society rendered so much the slower.\n\nInstead, therefore, of a low rate of profit, and a low rate of interest, for the one must be always directly as the other, being any proof of the flourishing situation of a country, it is distinctly and completely the reverse. High profits show that capital may be readily and beneficially invested in the different branches of industry, and wherever this is the case, it will be better for the borrower to pay a high rate of interest than it would be for him to pay a lower rate, in countries where there is less facility of employing his stock with advantage. The borrower who pays 10 or 12 per cent. for capital in the United States, generally makes a more profitable bargain than the English borrower who pays only 4 or 5 per cent. It is obviously not by the circumstance of the rate of interest payable on loans being absolutely high or low, but by the proportion between that rate and the average rate of profit, that we must determine whether they have been obtained on favourable or unfavourable terms.\n\n(s. s.)","sp":331,"ep":345},{"h":"DIRECTIONS\nDIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES","t":"Plate LXXXV. to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> page 56\n\u2014\u2014 LXXXVI.

During that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the literary intercourse between the different nations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> was comparatively so slight, that it seemed advisable to consider, separately and successively, the progress of the mind in England, in France, and in Germany. But from the era at which we are now arrived, the Republic of Letters may be justly understood to comprehend, not only these and other countries in their neighbourhood, but every region of the civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Disregarding, accordingly, all diversities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and of geographical situation, I shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the intellectual progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> in general; enlarging, however, chiefly on the Philosophy of those parts of Europe, from whence the rays of science have, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, diverged to the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the globe. I propose also, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the thickening crowd of useful authors, keeping pace in their numbers with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of knowledge and of liberality, to allot separate discourses to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, of Ethics, and of Politics; a distribution which, while it promises a more distinct and connected view of these different subjects, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> furnish convenient resting-places, both to the writer and to the reader, and can scarcely fail to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, in a stronger and more concentrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, whatever general conclusions may occur in the course of this survey.\n\nThe foregoing considerations, combined with the narrow limits assigned to the sequel of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, will sufficiently account for the contracted scale of some of the following.\nsketches, when compared with the magnitude of the questions to which they relate, and\nthe peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> which they derive from their immediate influence on the opinions of\nour own times.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of Locke and Leibnitz, with whom the metaphysical history of the eighteenth\ncentury opens, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to allow myself a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of latitude. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> which I\nhave assigned to both in my general plan seems to require, of course, a more ample space\nfor their leading doctrines, as well as for those of some of their contemporaries and imme-\ndiate successors, than I can spare for metaphysical systems of a more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; and as\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the most important of these are to be found in the speculations either of\none <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of the other, I shall endeavour, by connecting with my review of their works, those\nlonger and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> discussions which are necessary for the illustration of fundamen-\ntal principles, to avoid, as far as possible, in the remaining part of my discourse, any tedi-\nous digressions into the thorny paths of scholastic controversy. The critical remarks, ac-\ncordingly, which I am now to offer on their philosophical writings, will, I trust, enable me\nto execute the very slight sketches which are to follow in a manner at once more easy to\nmyself, and more satisfactory to the bulk of my readers.\n\nBut what I have chiefly in view in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> observations, is to correct cer-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> misapprehensions concerning the opinions of Locke and of Leibnitz, which have\nmisled (with very few exceptions) all the later historians who have treated of the li-\nterature of the eighteenth century. I have felt a more particular solicitude, to vindicate\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Locke, not only against the censures of his opponents, but against the mis-\ntaken comments and eulogies of his admirers, both in England and on the Continent.\nAppeals to his authority are so frequent in the reasonings of all who have since canvassed\nthe same subjects, that, without a precise idea of his distinguishing tenets, it is impossible\nto form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> estimate, either of the merits or demerits of his successors. In order to as-\nsist my readers in this previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, I shall endeavour, as far as I can, to make Locke\nhis own commentator; earnestly entreating them, before they proceed to the sequel of\nthis dissertation, to collate carefully those scattered extracts from his works, which, in the\nfollowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, they will find brought into contact with each other, with a view to their\nmutual illustration. My own conviction, I confess, is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Under-\nstanding has been much more generally applauded than read; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> I could only flatter\nmyself with the hope of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the attention of the public from the glosses of commen-\ntators to the author's text, I should think that I had made a considerable step towards\nthe correction of some radical and prevailing errors, which the supposed sanction of his\nname has hitherto sheltered from a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.","sp":13,"ep":16},{"h":"FREEDOM OF DISCUSSION","t":"m of discussion means the power of presenting all opinions, equally, relative to the subject of discussion; and of recommending them by any medium of persuasion which the author may think proper to employ. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> any obstruction is given to the delivering of one sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, not given to the delivering of another; if any advantage is attached to the delivering of one sort of opinion, not attached to the delivery of another, so far equality of treatment is destroyed, and so far the freedom of discussion is infringed;\u2014so far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is not left to the support of her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and so far, if the advantages are attached to the side of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, truth is deprived of her chance of prevailing.\n\nTo attach advantage to the delivering of one set of opinions, disadvantages to the delivering of another, is to make a choice. But we have already seen, that it is not safe for the people to let any body choose opinions for them. If it be said, that the people themselves might be the authors of this preference, what is this but to say, that the people can choose better before discussion than after; before they have obtained information than after it? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>, if the people choose before discussion, before information, they cannot choose for themselves. They must follow blindly the impulse of certain individuals, who, therefore, choose for them. This is, therefore, a pretence, for the purpose of disguising the truth, and cheating the people of that choice, upon which all their security for good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> depends.\n\nIf these deductions are as clear and incontrovertible as to us they appear to be, the inquiry respecting the principles which ought to regulate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the press is drawn pretty nearly to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. We have shown, that as far as regards the violation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of individuals in respect to both persons and things, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> on account of the press is required. We have shown in what manner the rights of individuals, in regard to reputation, should be defined by the civil code, and the violation of them prevented by the penal. We next proceeded to what may be considered as the main branch of the inquiry, namely, the use of the press in speaking of the institutions and functionaries of government. We have found, that in this respect the freedom of the press is of such importance, that there is no security for good government without it. We have also found, that the use of it, in respect to these subjects, admits but of two useful restrictions,\u2014that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> exhortation to obstruct any of the operations of government in detail, and that of imputing to a functionary of government a criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, which there was no ground, nor even any appearance of ground, to impute to him. These restrictions, of course, it would be very easy to define in the criminal code, and to find appropriate motives to sanction. In all other respects, we have seen that the press ought to be free; that if there is any limit to the power of delivering unfavourable opinions, either of the functionaries <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the institutions of government, and of recommending those opinions by any media, with the single exception of false facts, under the circumstances mentioned above, the benefits which may be derived from the freedom of the press are so greatly infringed, that hardly any security for good government can remain.\n\nIn the administration of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, or rather of\nwhat is called law, upon this subject, without being any thing better than the arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the judges, it is said, that though discussion should be free, it should be \"decent;\" and that all \"indecency\" in discussion should be punished as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBEL\">libel</a>. It is not our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in this discourse to give an exposition of the manifold deformities of the English law of libel. If we have been successful in developing the true principles which ought to regulate the freedom of the press, every reader may, by an application of those principles, determine what he ought to think of the several particulars which may there attract his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. We shall confine ourselves to a short notice of those dicta, or doctrines, which seem most likely to be pleaded in opposition to the principles which we have endeavoured to establish.\n\nThe question is, whether indecent discussion should be prohibited? To answer this question, we must, of course, inquire what is meant by indecent. In English libel law, where this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> holds so distinguished a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>,\u2014is it not defined? English legislators have not hitherto been good at defining; and English lawyers have always vehemently condemned, and grossly abused it. The word \"indecent,\" therefore, has always been a term under which it was not difficult, on each occasion, for the judge to include whatever he did not like. \"Decent,\" and \"what the judge likes,\" have, therefore, been pretty nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>.\n\nIndecency of discussion cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the delivery either of true or of false opinions, because discussion implies both. In all discussion there is supposed at least two parties, one who affirms, and one who denies. One of them must be in the wrong.\n\nThe delivery, though not of all true opinions, yet of some, may be said to be indecent. All opinions are either favourable or unfavourable. True opinions that are favourable to government and its functionaries will not be said to be indecent; nor will all opinions that are true and unfavourable be marked out for prohibition under that name. Opinions unfavourable may either be greatly unfavourable or slightly unfavourable. If any unfavourable opinions are exempted from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of indecency, it must be those which are slightly so. But observe, what would be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of prohibiting, as indecent, those which are greatly unfavourable. A true opinion, greatly unfavourable to a functionary, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of government, is greatly hurtful to the people. You would permit the slight evil to be spoken of, and hence removed; you would not permit the great evil to be spoken of.\n\nIf no true opinion can be regarded as indecent, meaning by indecent, requiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, we must inquire if any false opinion on matters of government ought to be treated as such. If all false opinions are indecent, all discussion is indecent. All false opinions, therefore, are not indecent. The English libel law does not treat any favourable opinions, how much soever false, as indecent. If all opinions that are false and unfavourable are said to be indecent, who is to judge if they are false? It has been already proved, that the people can confide the power of determining what opinions are true, what are false, to none but themselves. Nothing can resist this argument. Either the people do know, or they do not know, that an opinion is false. If they do not know, they can permit nobody to judge for them, and must leave discussion its free course. If they do know, all infliction of evil for the delivery of an opinion which then can do no harm, would be purely mischievous and utterly absurd.\n\nIf all opinions, true and false, must be allowed to be delivered, so must all the media of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>. We need not examine minutely the truth of this deduction, because it will probably be allowed. It will be said, however, that though all opinions may be delivered, and the grounds of them stated, it must be done in calm and gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. Vehement expressions, all words and phrases calculated to inflame, may justly be regarded as indecent, because they have a tendency rather to pervert than rectify the judgment.\n\nTo examine this proposition, it must be taken out of that state of vagueness in which so many things are left by the English law, and made, if possible, to speak a language, the meaning of which may be precisely ascertained.\n\nWe have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> decided, as appeared, on very substantial grounds, that the statement of no opinion, favourable or unfavourable, true or false, with its media of proof, ought to be forbidden. No language, necessary for that purpose, can be indecent, meaning here, as before, nothing by that term, as nothing can be meant, but simply punishable, or proper for punishment.\n\nBut the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between delivering an opinion one way and another way is, that in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is simply delivered, in the other it is delivered with indications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>. The meaning of the phrase in question then must be, that an opinion must not be delivered with indications of passion. What! not even a favourable one? \"Oh, yes! a favourable one. Merited praise ought to be delivered with warmth.\" Here, then, is inequality, and therefore mischief at once. An opinion, meaning here a true opinion, if it is favourable, you allow\u2014if unfavourable, you do not allow\u2014to be delivered in a certain way. Why? Because in that way, you say, it is calculated to make an undue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. Opinions favourable, then, you wish to make an undue impression, and by that confess the wickedness of your intention. You desire that the people should think better of the institutions and functionaries of their government than they deserve; in other words, you wish the government to be bad.\n\nIf opinions, to what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> soever unfavourable, may be freely and fully delivered, there are two conclusive reasons why the terms in which they are delivered should not be liable to punishment. In the first place, the difference between one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of delivery and another is of little consequence. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> place, you cannot forbid the delivery in one set of terms, without giving a power of preventing it in almost all.\n\n1. The difference is of little consequence. If I say barely that such a functionary of government, or such an institution of government, is the cause of great injury and suffering to the people, all that I\ncan do more by any language is, to give intimation, that the conduct of such functionary, or the existence of such institution, excites in me great contempt, or great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, or great hatred, and ought to excite them in others. But if I put this in the way of a direct proposition, I may do so, because then it will be a naked statement with regard to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of fact, and cannot be forbidden, without overthrowing the whole of the doctrine which we have already established. If, then, I give indication of certain sentiments of mine, and of my opinion of what ought or be the sentiments of others explicitly, I ought, you say, to be held innocent; if implicitly, guilty. Implicitly, or explicitly, that is the difference, and the whole of the difference. If I say, that such a judge, on such an occasion, took a bribe, and pronounced an unjust decision, which ruined a meritorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, this is a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of opinion, and ought not, according to the doctrine already established, to meet with the smallest obstruction. If I also state the matter of fact with regard to myself, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> has excited in me great compassion for the injured family, and great anger and hatred against the author of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a>, this must be fully allowed. I must further be allowed to express freely my opinion, that this action ought to excite similar sentiments in other members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, and that the judge ought to receive an appropriate punishment. Much of all this, however, I may say in another manner. I may say it much more shortly by implication.\u2014Here, I may cry, is an act for the indignation of mankind! Here is a villain, who, invested with the most sacred of trusts, has prostituted it to the vilest of purposes! Why is he not an object of public execration? Why are not the vials of wrath already poured forth upon his odious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>?\u2014All this means nothing, but that he has committed the act; that I hate him for it, and commiserate the sufferers; that I think he ought to be punished; and that other people should feel as I do. It cannot be pretended, that between these two modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> the difference, in point of real and ultimate effect, can be considerable. For a momentary warmth, the passionate language may have considerable power. The permanent opinion formed of the character of the man, as well as the punishment which, under a tolerable administration of law, he can sustain, must depend wholly upon the real state of the facts; any peculiarity in the language in which they may have been originally announced soon loses its effects. If that language has expressed no more indignation than what was really due, it has done nothing more than what the knowledge of the facts themselves would have done. If it has expressed more indignation than what was due, the knowledge of the facts operates immediately to extinguish it, and, what is more, to excite an unfavourable opinion of him who had thus displayed his intemperance. No evil then is produced; or none but what is very slight and momentary. If there should be a short-lived excess of unfavourable feeling, we have next to consider what is the proper remedy. Punishment should never be applied, when the end can be attained by more desirable means. To destroy any excess of unfavourable feeling, all that is necessary is, to show the precise state of the facts, and the real amount of the evil which they import. All excess of feeling arises from imputing to the facts a greater efficacy in the way of evil than belongs to them. Correct this opinion, and the remedy is complete.\n\n2. You cannot forbid the use of passionate language, without giving a power of obstructing the use of censorial language altogether. The reason exists in the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of language. You cannot speak of moral acts in language which does not imply approbation and disapprobation. All such language may be termed passionate language. How can you point out a line when passionate language begins, impassionate ends? The effect of words upon the mind depends upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> which we have with them. But no two men have the same associations with the same words. A word which may excite trains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, will excite none in another. A word may appear to one man a passionate word, which does not appear so to another. Suppose the legislature were to say, that all censure, conveyed in passionate language, shall be punished, hardly could the vices either of the functionaries or institutions of government be spoken of in any language which the judges might not condemn as passionate language, and which they would not have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with other functionaries, to prohibit by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a>. The evil, therefore, which must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> be incurred by a power to punish language to which the name of passionate could be applied, would be immense. The evil which is incurred by leaving it exempt from punishment is too insignificant to allow that almost anything should be risked for preventing it.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>, in some of its shapes, has, in most countries, been placed on the footing of an institution of the state. Ought the freedom of the press to be as complete, in regard to this, as we have seen that it ought to be, in regard to all other institutions of the state? If any one says that it ought not, it is incumbent upon him to show wherein the principles which are applicable to the other institutions fail in their application to this.\n\nWe have seen, that, in regard to all other institutions, it is unsafe for the people to permit any but themselves to choose opinions for them. Nothing can be more certain, than that it is unsafe for them to permit any but themselves to choose for them in religion. If they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> with the power of choosing their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> opinions, they part with every power. It is well known with what ease religious opinions can be made to embrace every thing upon which the unlimited power of rulers, and the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of the people, depend. The doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience and non-resistance was a religious doctrine. Permit any man, or any set of men, to say what shall and what shall not be religious opinions, you make them despotic immediately. This is so obvious, that it requires neither illustration nor proof.\n\nBut if the people here, too, must choose opinions for themselves, discussion must have its free course; and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> which we have proved to be true in regard to other institutions, are true in regard to this.\n\n(F.F.)\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">LIFE</a> PRESERVERS. See PRESERVERS.","sp":566,"ep":569},{"h":"GASTEROPODA","t":"Organs of Progressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">Motion</a> fitted for Creeping.\n\nThis is one of the most extensive groups of Molluscous animals. The marks by which it is distinguished are well defined, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> have been successfully illustrated.\n\nThe Gasteropoda may be considered as having the body protected dorsally by the cloak, and ventrally by the foot. The cloak is either continuous, and usually more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> less arched for the reception of the viscera underneath, or it is interrupted by a pro-\njecting bag, in which are contained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> and reproductive organs. This projecting bag is tapering and spiral, and always protected externally by a shell. When the cloak is continuous, the surface is variously marked, and frequently exhibits a particular portion, more elevated than the rest, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> concealing a testaceous plate, which has been termed the shield.\n\nThe foot, situate on the ventral surface, and in opposition to the cloak, exhibits a flat soft surface, consisting of interlaced muscular fibres. Its central surface serves as support to the viscera, while externally it constitutes the organ of progressive motion. It is a sucker rather than a foot, and enables the animal to adhere to objects when at rest, and to crawl from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to another by a succession of adhesions, not unlike the leech. It is also used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>.\n\nBy the union of the cloak and foot, laterally and posteriorly, a sac is formed, which is open in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> for the protrusion of the neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. The line of junction between the cloak and foot is marked, in general, by peculiarities in the condition of the margins of both.\n\nThe neck is usually divided from the cloak by a collar, or thickened margin belonging to the latter, or rather to the shield, while in other cases it is continuous. Underneath, the neck is frequently attached to the foot.\n\nThe head supports the tentacula and eyes, is free dorsally, but frequently intimately connected with the foot on its ventral side. The portion between the tentacula and the mouth is termed the snout (le muse of the French; and its margin le chaperon). The mouth exhibits various modifications of fleshy lips and corneous jaws. The inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> are covered in some species with reflected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> to aid deglutition. The tongue can scarcely be detected in some of the genera, while in others it is a simple tubercle, or a strap-shaped, spiral organ, armed with transverse rows of teeth. This spiral tongue, where it is fixed to the base of the mouth, is broadest, and there also the spinous processes are strongest. The spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is narrowest and softest, and folded up behind the pharynx. M. Cuvier conjectures, and apparently with plausibility, that the spiral portion comes forward into the mouth to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a tongue, in proportion as the anterior part is worn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> and absorbed. (See his Memoire sur la Vivipare d'eau douce, p. 12.)\n\nThe organs of respiration exhibit the two modifications of lungs and gills, and enable us to divide the gasteropoda into two classes, which we have termed Pulmonifera and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRANCHIFERA\">Branchifera</a>. M. Cuvier appears to have been in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> aware of the importance of the distinction when he instituted his order Pulmon\u00e9s, but he afterwards suffered himself to be more influenced by the presence of an operculum, the shape of the aperture of the shell and the supposed separation of the sexes, than by the characters of the respiratory organs.\n\nI. Class.\n\nPulmonifera.\n\nThe pulmonary cavity is single and lateral. Its\n\norifice is capable of being closed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the animal. The blood-vessels are spread, chiefly on the walls and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, like delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nThe reproductive system of the animals of this class exhibits the sexual organs, in general, united in the same individual. Mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>, however, is necessary. All the species are oviparous. The eggs are either naked, as in the terrestrial genera, or enveloped in a gelatinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> like the aquatic kinds. The embryo acquires nearly all its members while in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, and the shell is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> size previous to hatching. Sir Everard Home, when treating of the distinguishing characters between the ova of the sepia, and those of the vermes testacea, that live in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> (Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 297), and when referring to the ova of the vermes testacea, says, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the shell were formed in the ovum, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of aerating the blood must be very materially interfered with, for this reason, the covering, or shell of the egg, first drops off, and the young is hatched before the shell of the animal is formed; this I have seen take place in the eggs of the garden snail, but in the testacea that live in water, the young requires some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, between the egg being hatched and the young acquiring its shell, which is not necessary in those that live on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; for this purpose, the ova are enclosed in chambers of a particular kind.\" The assertion here made, and founded on a priori considerations, that the shell is not formed until after the egg is hatched, is opposed by every observation which we have been able to make on the subject; and what is more surprising, it is at variance with his own observations on the garden snail, the very example produced in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>. The eggs of a snail laid on 5th August 1773 were hatched on the 20th of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and their condition at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> distinctly stated. \"On the 20th, the young were hatched, and the shells completely formed.\" It is much more becoming, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, to observe how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> operates, than to pronounce what she must do.\n\nI. Order.\n\nTerrestrial.\n\nThe animals of this order reside constantly on the land. When by accident they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the water, they appear to be incapable of using their foot as a sucker or as a fin, and die after a few writhings. The species in general prefer moist places, and seldom are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. After a shower they speedily leave their hiding-places, and at this time they may be readily collected. The eggs are hatched on land.\n\n1. Subdivision.\n\nCloak and foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, and containing the viscera between them.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> are included those animals denominated slugs in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. They possess four retractile tentacula, of unequal length. The eyes are two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, seated at the tips of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> tentacula.\n\n1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">Tribe</a>.\n\nCloak furnished with a shield.\nThe shield is, in general, strengthened internally by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of earthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, in the form of grains, or a plate.\n\nA. Shield anterior.\n\nIn this group, the shield is placed nearer the head than the tail. It contains four genera, two of which have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> tails, or furnished with peculiar organs, while in the remaining genera the tails are simple.\n\n1. Extremity of the Tail Compound.\n\nGenus, Arion.\u2014A mucous orifice at the termination of the cloak.\n\nThis genus has been recently instituted by M. le <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> D'Audebard De F\u00e9rrussac, in his Histoire Naturelle G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Particuli\u00e8re du Mollusques Terrestres et Fluviailes, folio, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1819, 3e liv. p. 59. The species of which it consists were formerly confounded with those which now constitute the restricted genus Limax. It differs, however, in possessing the mucous pore, in the pulmonary orifice being near the anterior margin of the shield, with the sexual orifice underneath, and in the soft state of the calcareous matter in the shield. The author now quoted has described four species, and illustrated their characters by beautiful and expressive figures. The Limax ater (together with its variety rufus) of British writers may be regarded as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of the genus.\n\nGenus, Plectrophorus.\u2014A conical protuberant shell at the termination of the cloak.\n\nThis genus, likewise instituted by M. Ferrussac, nearly resembles the preceding in form. Three species have been described and figured, which, however, differ remarkably from one another.\n\n2. Extremity of the Tail Simple.\n\nThe genera of this group have neither a terminal mucous orifice nor shell.\n\nGenus, Limax.\u2014Pulmonary orifice near the posterior margin of the shield.\n\nThis genus, as now restricted by M. Ferrussac, differs from the Arion in the absence of the caudal mucous pore, the position of the pulmonary cavity, and the orifice of the sexual organs placed under the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> tentaculum. The calcareous matter of the shield is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, and appears as a shelly plate. Six species have been described and figured.\n\nThe Limax cinereus of Lister is the type of the genus.\n\nGenus, Limacellus.\u2014Pulmonary orifice near the anterior margin of the shield.\n\nThis genus was instituted by M. de Blainville, in the Journal de Physique, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1817, p. 442, pl. 11, f. 5, nov. His observations were made on a specimen in a shrivelled state, preserved in spirits of wine, which was communicated to him from Dr Leach of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is, therefore, necessarily imperfect. The animal is rounded before and pointed behind, and dorsally protuberant. The whole body is smooth, soft, and of a greyish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The shield, which adheres on all sides, is destitute of any shelly plate. It is notched near its anterior margin, at the opening of the pulmonary cavity. The foot is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and separated from the cloak by a slight fold, which, on the right side, forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, leading from the base of the right tentaculum to the posterior extremity of the body. It is inferred from this appearance, that the sexual organs are disjoined, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> parts being seated in the tail, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> organs occupy the ordinary position. The only species, Limacellus lactescens, is supposed to have been brought from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTILLES\">Antilles</a>.\n\nB. Shield posterior.\n\nIn this group, the shield is placed nearer to the tail than in the preceding, and is fortified internally with a subspiral plate. It contains one genus.\n\nGenus, Parmacella.\u2014Posterior extremity of the shield containing the shell.\n\nThe pulmonary cavity is placed underneath the shell of the shield. This arrangement occasions a corresponding posterior position to the heart. Along the back, from the shield to the head, are three grooves, the middle one of these is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>. The shield itself adheres only at the posterior portion, the anterior part being free. The internal structure is similar to the slugs. The only marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, indeed, consists in two conical appendages of the sexual cavity, by which there is an approach to the Helices.\n\nThe Parmacella Olivieri is the only known species, and was first described, and its structure unfolded, by M. Cuvier. It was brought from Mesopotamia by M. Olivier.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nCloak destitute of a shield.\n\nIn this tribe, the pulmonary cavity is situate near the tail.\n\nA. Tail covered with a single spiral open shell.\n\nGenus, Testacella.\u2014Pulmonary cavity underneath the shell.\n\nThe vent and pulmonary cavity are from the position of the protecting shell, on which they are dependent, nearly terminal. The foot extends on each side beyond the body. From the manner in which the blood is aerated, the auricle and ventricle are placed longitudinally, the latter being anterior.\n\nThis genus at present consists of three species. One of these, T. halitoideus, is a native of France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. It lives in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and feeds on the earthworm. Another species, the T. Maugei, was first observed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a> by M. Maugei. It has been figured in the splendid work on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">Mollusca</a>, by Ferrussac, already referred to, Tab. vii. f. 10\u201412, from specimens found in the botanical garden of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, and communicated by Dr Leach. It has been conjectured, that the British animals may have been introduced along with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> from Teneriffe. The third species, T. ambiguus, is established on the doubtful authority of a shell in the collection of M. Lamarck.\n\nB. Destitute of an external shell.\n\nGenus, Veronicellus.\u2014Cloak fortified posteriorly by an internal shelly plate. Tentacula four.\n\nThis genus was instituted by M. Blainville for the reception of the V. lavis, established from a specimen preserved in spirits, belonging to the British Museum, and communicated by Dr Leach. It is figured\nby Ferrussac, Tab. vii. Fig. 6, 7. The body is somewhat pointed before, and rounded behind. The cloak is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; the foot rather narrow, and plaited on the edges. The opening to the pulmonary cavity is situate on the right side posteriorly, under the shell. A little in advance of this is another opening, in the middle of which is the funnel-shaped aperture of the anus. The sexual organs are united, and placed at the base of the right tentaculum.\n\nIt is not improbable, according to Ferrussac, that the Limax nudus cinereus terrestris of Sloane (Jam. ii. p. 190, Tab. ccxxxiii, f. 2, 3), may belong to this genus, or rather, that the individual brought home by Sloane may have been the identical specimen submitted to M. Blainville's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.\n\nGenus, Onchidium.\u2014Cloak tuberculated. Snout enlarged and emarginate. Tentacula two in number, with eyes at the tips.\n\nThis genus was instituted by Dr Buchanan, in Lin. Trans. Vol. V. p. 132, for the reception of a species which he found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, on the leaves of Typha Eleocharis. It is not, according to this naturalist, \"like many others of the worm kind, an hermaphrodite animal; for the male and female organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> are in distinct individuals. I have not yet perceived any mark to distinguish the sexes, while they are not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPULATION\">copulation</a>, as in both, the anus and sexual organs are placed in a perforation (cloaca <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNIS\">communis</a>), in the under part of the tail, immediately behind the foot; but during coition, the distinction of sexes is very evident, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a> protruding to a great length, considering the size of the animal.\"\n\n2. Subdivision.\n\nCloak and foot parallel; the viscera contained in a spiral dorsal protuberance, protected by a shell.\n\nThis group includes the animals usually denominated Snails. They bear a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> resemblance to the slugs. The shield, however, has a thickened margin in front, destined to secrete the matter of the shell. In the part corresponding with the centre of the shield in the slugs there is (as Cuvier has characteristically termed it) a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rupture, through which the viscera are protruded into a conical bag twisted spirally. In this bag are contained the principal viscera, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> occupying its extremity. The body of the animal is attached to the pillar of the shell by a complicated muscle, which shifts its place with the growth of the animal. The mouth is furnished above with a thin-arched cornaceous mandible, notched on the edges. The whole body, including the foot and head, are, in general, capable of being withdrawn into the cavity of the shell. In one genus, the aperture is closed by a lid.\n\n1. Tribe.\n\nThe foot is furnished with a lid or operculum, for closing the mouth of the shell when the animal withdraws itself into the cavity.\n\nGenus, Cyclostoma.\u2014Aperture of the shell circular.\n\nThe tentacula are linear and subretractile. The primary ones have subglobular, highly-polished extremities, considered by Montague as the eyes. The true eyes, however, are placed at the exterior base of the large tentacula, and are elevated on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, which are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a>.\n\nThe aperture of the pulmonary cavity is situate on the neck. The sexes are likewise separate; the penis of the male being large, flat, and muscular. The mouth is formed into a kind of proboscis, and the upper lip is deeply emarginate. The Turbo elegans of British conchologists is the type of the genus.\n\n2. Tribe.\n\nFoot destitute of a lid.\n\nA. Aperture of the shell with a thickened margin.\n\nIn all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, the margin of the shell, while the animal is young, is thin; but upon reaching a certain period, it becomes thick, and bordered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, after which, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> increase of size.\n\n1.

Aperture of the shell lunate; the width and length nearly equal.\n\nThe shells differ from the slugs chiefly in the organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAGINA\">vagina</a>, previous to its termination in the sexual cavity, is joined by the canal of the vesicle, and by two ducts, each proceeding from a bundle of multitudinous vesicles. Each bundle consists of a stem or duct, and numerous branches, with blunt terminations. These organs secrete a thin milky fluid, the use of which is unknown.\n\nThe species belonging to this genus are numerous, and exhibit, in the form, the markings, and the convolutions of the shell, numerous characters for their subdivision.\n\nGenus, Bulimus.\u2014Aperture of the shell longer than broad.\n\nThe structure of the animals of this genus has not been determined; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to conclude, that it is similar to the snails.

Order.","sp":880,"ep":884},{"h":"HUNTINGDONSHIRE","t":"an inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of England, and, except Rutlandshire, the smallest of the whole. It is bounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east and east by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAMBRIDGESHIRE\">Cambridgeshire</a>, on the north-west and west by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a>, and on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEDFORDSHIRE\">Bedfordshire</a>. Its greatest breadth is twenty-three miles, and its greatest length thirty miles, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> contents are 350 miles.\n\nIt is divided into four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, containing six market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and 104 parishes, in which are 7719 houses. At the census of 1811 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants was 42,208, viz. 20,402 males, and 21,806 females. The baptisms of the preceding year were 613 males and 591 females, the burials 446 males and 404 females, the marriages were 357. The number of families were 8808, of whom 5361 were employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; 2205 in trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>; and 1242 in various occupations. The towns containing more than 1000 inhabitants are as follow:\n\n| Towns          | Houses | Inhabitants |\n|----------------|--------|-------------|\n| Huntingdon     | 471    | 2397        |\n| St Ives        | 489    | 2426        |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMSEY\">Ramsey</a>         | 484    | 2390        |\n\nFour members are returned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, viz. two for the county, and two for the borough of Huntingdon.\n\nThe appearance of the county is of three descriptions. In the south-east it is an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, the middle varying in its surface with gentle undulations, and without many inclosures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> many woods; the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> was anciently a forest, and still contains a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of woodland, whose foliage gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to the scenery. On the north-eastern side a portion of the county is fine land, comprising a part of what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, comprehending nearly one-fifth of the whole county.\n\nThe two most considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Ouse and the Nen. The Ouse enters from Bedfordshire, and crossing the whole of the county, passes into Cambridgeshire in its way to the German Ocean. It is navigable in its whole extent through Huntingdonshire, and forms an important means of intercourse. The Nen enters from Northamptonshire, and runs to the marshes; it is also navigable the greater part of its course. Besides these, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">Cam</a> passes through a part of the county. There are three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, viz. Whittlesea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a>, Ramsey mere, and Ugg mere; the first of these is the largest, and covers an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of several miles in extent. It affords excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, and pleasant sailing, which induces many parties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to visit it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> season. Projects for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> this lake have been formed, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is not deep, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> excellent; but they have not yet been carried into execution.\n\nThe county of Huntingdon scarcely contains any manufactures, excepting some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>, performed by the females; but the improvements of machinery in other districts have much diminished that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of employment. The only trade is that of corn, cattle, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> of the few flocks of sheep.\n\nAgriculture is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> pursuit of the district. The marshes and meadows are highly productive, and many oxen are fattened on them, without any other food than their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> grass. Much of this land is under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, and produces most abundant crops of oats and colesced; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> for making the latter into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> are numerous. The hay from those fens is very considerable, but on the banks of the rivers they are subject to great floods, which sometimes destroy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> of the year. Though these lands are very valuable, yet the expense of draining them causes a great deduction from their value.\n\nThe soils in the upland parts of the county are various, but consist principally of a tenacious clayey loam, or of a deep gravelly loam with some clay. Much of this is in open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> fields, where each occupier is compelled to follow a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> like that of his neighbours. On the best of these lands the usual course of cropping is a year's fallow, then wheat or barley, next beans, and then barley or wheat.\nthe land of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> somewhat inferior, a three course rotation of fallow, wheat, and peas or beans, is pursued. In those fields that are calculated for turnips, that root is succeeded by barley and wheat, or by wheat and barley. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> produce of the lands is stated at five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of barley, four of oats, and three and a half of wheat to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. The excellent practice of sowing clover between two corn crops is followed to a very small extent. The farms are generally small, few rentals exceed \u00a3200 per annum.\n\nThe sheep of Huntingdonshire are a mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, composed of crosses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a> breeds, with the native kinds. They are without horns, of very imperfect shape, but are found profitable from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of wool they produce; their fleeces usually weighing from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> to eight pounds each. The sheep of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> race of the county are much inferior to those produced by the crossing with the better kinds; many of these are still found in the open commons, and their fleeces seldom exceed four pounds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. The cows are bred with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of many races. Very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> or cheese is made; the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> being the suckling of calves to supply veal for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>. Many horses are bred in the lower part of the county, but without much attention to their races. From this practice of breeding, it has become very general to execute all the agricultural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> with mares.\n\nThe remains of antiquity in this county are principally of Roman origin; among them are the vestiges of the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, which were constructed by that people across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The remains of Ramsey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a> and Castle, the seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> from which Oliver Cromwell, a native of this county, sprung, are of venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>. The monks who formerly occupied it were highly celebrated for their knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. The churches of Bluntisham, St Ives, and St Neots, and the Castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KIMBOLTON\">Kimbolton</a>, exhibit marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> antiquity.\n\nThe most remarkable noblemen and gentlemen's seats are, Kimbolton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>; Bucden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">Palace</a>, Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>; Connington Castle, J.

In addition to the general principles of Hydraulics, as they have been detailed in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">HYDRODYNAMICS</a>, of the Encyclopaedia, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to give some account of the later attempts that have been made to improve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of this department of science, especially those of Mr De Prony, contained in his Recherches Physicomath\u00e9matiques sur la Th\u00e9orie des eaux courantes, 4to. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1804; and those of Dr Thomas Young, in his Hydraulic Investigations, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1808.\n\nIngenious and important as the Chevalier Dubuat's theory of the friction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> is admitted to have been, it cannot be denied, that it is extremely deficient both in the distinct elucidation of the physical grounds of the phenomena, and with respect to the neatness and simplicity of the methods of calculation. Mr Girard, according to Mr De Prony, was the first who entertained the fortunate idea of applying the theory of Mr Coulomb to the resistance of water flowing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>; and in his two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> on the Theory of Running Waters, he proposes a formula depending on the sum of the velocity and its square, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the friction; and deducting a constant coefficient from twelve experiments of Chezy and Dubuat, he obtains a formula equally correct with that of Dubuat, and far more simple.\n\nMr De Prony has obtained an expression founded on the same theoretical principles that Mr Girard had adopted, but much more perfect and accurate, and agreeing very sufficiently with all those of Mr Dubuat's experiments to which he has applied it. But Mr De Prony's formula, as well as Mr Dubuat's, fails altogether, when we attempt to employ it for the computation of the discharge through very slender tubes, and though his work was printed a year or two earlier than Dr Young's investigations, it would have been impossible for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it in his physiological inquiries, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it had not been wholly unknown to him, since the resistances which he had occasion to compute were principally such as occurred in tubes considerably less than a thousandth of an inch in diameter.\n\nThe most material deviation of the experiments from the theory of Mr Coulomb and Mr De Prony appears to arise from the great comparative increase of that portion of the resistance which varies simply as the velocity, when the tubes become extremely small; and it is upon this circumstance that Dr Young has founded the principal characteristic of his theory of the circulation of the blood; the resistance, notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> slowness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the blood through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> vessels, being almost entirely confined to those vessels; and in order to comprehend in one formula the whole of Dubuat's experiments, together with those of Gerstner, and his own, on very small pipes, he has found it necessary to introduce, into the determination of the coefficients for expressing the two kinds of resistance, a quantity depending on the diameter of the tube, and capable of being readily computed from it, although by a formula which is founded on empirical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> only. The method of calculation, however, appears to be equally general and convenient, and it will, therefore, not be superfluous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> the particulars of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> in the words of the author.\n\nDr Young \"found,\" he observes, \"that the friction could not be represented by any single power of the velocity, although it frequently approached,\" for the same pipe, \"to the proportion of that power, of which the exponent is 1.5; but that it appeared to consist of two parts, the one varying simply as the...\"\nvelocity, the other as its square. The proportion of these parts to each other must, however, be considered as different, in pipes of different diameters, the first part being less perceptible in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pipes, or in rivers, but becoming greater than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> tubes, while the second also becomes greater, for each given portion of the internal surface of the pipe, as the diameter is diminished.\n\n\"If we express, in the first place, all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> in French inches, calling the height employed in overcoming the friction $f$, the velocity in a second $v$, the diameter of the pipe $d$, and its length $l$, we may make $f = \\frac{a}{d} v^2 + 2c \\frac{l}{d} v$; for, it is obvious, that the friction must be directly as the length of the pipe; and since the pressure is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the area of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, and the surface producing the friction to its circumference or diameter, the relative magnitude of the friction, \"or the friction for any given portion of the section,\" must also be inversely as the diameter, or nearly so, as Dubuat has justly observed.\n\nWe shall then find that $a$ must be .0000001 (430 + $\\frac{75}{d} - \\frac{1440}{d+12} - \\frac{180}{d+3}$), and $c = .0000001 (\\frac{900d}{dd+1000} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d}} [\\frac{1050}{d} + \\frac{12}{d} + \\frac{9}{dd}])$. Hence it is easy to calculate the velocity for any given pipe or river, and with any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of water. For the height required for producing the velocity, independently of friction, is, according to Dubuat, $\\frac{vv}{478}$, or rather, as it appears from almost all the experiments which I have compared, $\\frac{vv}{550}$; and the whole height $h$ is therefore equal to $f + \\frac{vv}{550}$, or $h = \\left(\\frac{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a>}{d} + \\frac{1}{550}\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>) v^2 + 2c \\frac{l}{d} v$; and making $b = \\frac{1}{ad + 0.00182}$, and $e = \\frac{bd}{d} v^2 + 2cv = bh$, whence $v = \\sqrt{(bh + e^2) - e}$. In order to adapt this formula to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of rivers, we must make $l$ infinite; then $b$ becomes $\\frac{d}{ad}$, and $bh = \\frac{d}{a} \\cdot \\frac{h}{l} = \\frac{ds}{a}$, $s$ being the sine of the inclination, and $d$ four times the hydraulic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> depth; and since $e$ is here $\\frac{c}{d} v = \\frac{\\sqrt{(ads + ce) - e}}{a}$; and in most rivers, $v$ becomes nearly $\\sqrt{(20000ds)}$.\n\n\"In order to show the agreement of these formulae with the result of observation, I have extracted,\" says Dr Young, \"as indiscriminately and impartially as possible, forty of the experiments made and collected by Dubuat; I have added to these some of Gerstner's, with a few of my own; and I have compared the results of these experiments with Dubuat's calculations, and with my own formul\u00e6, in separate columns.\" \"It appears from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, that in the forty experiments, extracted from the collection, which served as a basis for Dubuat's calculations, the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of his formula is $\\frac{1}{24}$ of the whole velocity, and that of mine $\\frac{1}{25}$ only; but if we omit the four experiments, in which the superficial velocity only of a river was observed, and in which I have calculated the mean velocity by Dubuat's rules, the mean error of the remaining 36 is $\\frac{1}{35}$, according to my mode of calculation, and $\\frac{1}{37}$, according to Mr Dubuat's; so that\" \"the accuracy of the two formul\u00e6 may be considered as precisely equal with respect to these forty experiments. In\" \"six experiments which Dubuat has wholly rejected,\" \"without any very sufficient reason,\" \"the mean error of his formula is about $\\frac{1}{24}$, and that of mine $\\frac{1}{45}$. In fifteen of Gerstner's experiments, the mean error of Dubuat's rule is $\\frac{1}{3}$, that of mine $\\frac{1}{4}$; and in the three experiments which I made with very fine tubes, the error of my own rules is $\\frac{1}{15}$ of the whole, while in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> Dubuat's formul\u00e6 completely fail.\" \"It would be useless to seek for a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of accuracy, unless it were probable that the errors of the experiments themselves were less than those of the calculations; but if a sufficient number of extremely accurate and frequently repeated experiments could be obtained, it would be very possible to adopt my formul\u00e6 still more correctly to their results.\n\n\"If any person should be desirous of making use of Dubuat's formula, it would still be a great convenience to begin by determining $v$ according to this method; then, taking $b = \\frac{l}{h-vv:478}$, or rather, as Langsdorf makes it, $b = \\frac{l}{h-vv:482}$, to proceed in calculating $v$\" again \"by the formula $v = 143.5 (\\sqrt{d-2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b-HL/(b+1.6)}} - 0.001)$, since this determination of $b$ will, in general, be far more accurate than the simple expression $b = \\frac{l+45d}{h}$, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> repetition of the calculation, with approximate values of $v$, may thus be avoided. Sometimes, indeed, the values of $v$, found by this repetition, will constitute a diverging instead of a converging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>; and in such cases, we can only employ a conjectural value of $v$, intermediate between the two preceding ones.\"\nHaving sufficiently examined the accuracy of my formula, I shall now reduce it into English inches, and shall add a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of the coefficients, for assisting the calculation. In this case, \\(a\\) becomes .0000001\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{413}{d} + \\frac{75}{d+12.8} - \\frac{1440}{d+3.55} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{180}{d} = .0000001\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{900d}{dd+1136} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\left( \\frac{1085}{d} + \\frac{13.21}{d} + \\frac{1.0563}{dd} \\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{1}{alcd + .00171}, \\quad c = \\frac{bel}{d}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v = \\sqrt{(bh+c^2)} - c,\n\\]\n\nor, for a river, \\(v = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{ds}{a} + \\frac{cc}{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">aa</a>} \\right) - \\frac{c}{a}}\\), as before;\n\nand in either case the superficial velocity of a river may be found, very nearly, by adding to mean velocity \\(v\\) its square root, and the velocity at the bottom by subtracting it.\n\n### Table of Coefficients, for English Inches.\n\n| d   | a   | c   |\n|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1   | .17x | .17x |\n| 2   | .17x | .17x |\n| 3   | .17x | .17x |\n| 4   | .17x | .17x |\n| 5   | .17x | .17x |\n\nCoulomb's experiments on the friction of fluids, made by means of the torsion of wires, give about .00014 for the value of \\(c\\), which agrees as nearly with this table, as any constant number could be expected to do. I have, however, reason to think, from some experiments communicated to me by Mr Robertson Buchanan, that the value of \\(a\\), for pipes about half an inch in diameter, is somewhat too small; my mode of calculation, as well as Dubuat's, giving too great a velocity in such cases.\n\nIt must, indeed, be confessed that, notwithstanding the convenience of this theory for calculation, with the assistance of the tables of coefficients, their determination from the diameters of the pipes is somewhat too complicated either for elegance or for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, if considered as representing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. The formula of Prony, though it fails for small pipes, and would, therefore, have been useless for Dr Young's purpose, has the advantage of great simplicity, and even of superior accuracy, within certain limits of the magnitude of the pipes, although it seems to be indebted for this accuracy to accidental causes only.\n\nIf we take Dr Young's equation \\(v = \\sqrt{(ads+cc)} - c\\),\n\nor \\(v = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{ds}{a} + \\frac{cc}{aa} \\right) - \\frac{c}{a}}\\), and assume for \\(a\\) the constant mean value .0000377, and for \\(c\\) .00003466, we shall have \\(v = \\sqrt{(26520ds+.845)} - .919\\), which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to Prony's formula reduced to French inches.\n\nFor pipes Mr De Prony merely substitutes \\(h\\) for \\(s\\), neglecting entirely the height due to the velocity.\n\nHe also gives a still simpler approximation for common purposes, \\(v = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{26513dh}{l} \\right)}\\), or \\(\\sqrt{(26513ds)}\\),\n\nwhich differs very little from Dr Young's rule published in his Lectures, that \"the velocity is a mean proportional between the hydraulic mean depth and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in 2800 yards;\" for this, in French measures, would be \\(\\sqrt{(27000ds)}\\). It is obvious, however, that in many cases these formulas must require considerable modification, since, when the velocity is great, the height due to it may become considerable, and since the friction in small pipes is certainly increased beyond its mean value: nor can these opposite causes of error be expected always to compensate each other even in pipes of moderate dimensions.\n\nIf we had a greater number of very accurate experiments, we might construct a sufficiently complete table of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) from their results alone, without any general formulas. Thus, taking \\(f = h - \\frac{v}{550}\\), we readily obtain the equation,\n\n\\[\na = \\left( \\frac{f}{v} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\frac{f'}{v'} \\right)^{-1}\n\\]\n\nin which \\(f\\) and \\(f'\\), \\(v\\) and \\(v'\\), are the corresponding values of \\(f\\) and \\(v\\) for the same pipe with different pressures, or for two pipes so nearly alike in diameter, that the coefficients may be considered as the same for both; and then \\(2c = \\frac{f}{v} \\cdot \\frac{d}{l} - av\\); or for a river, \\(a = \\frac{ds}{v} - \\frac{d's'}{v'}\\), and \\(2c = \\frac{ds}{v} - av\\). But the results of twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> experiments, compared in this manner, afford a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> series only; thus:\nIt is, therefore, hopeless to attempt to deduce a good formula for the coefficients from these results alone, and we must be satisfied for the present either with Dubuat's formula, or Prony's, or with Dr Young's table. For a single instance of the comparative accuracy of these modes of computation, we may take an example from Mr Jardine's observation of the pipe supplying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> with water, as published by Dr Brewster. Here \\(d\\) was 45, \\(h\\) 612, \\(l\\) 179160, and \\(v\\) 20.52 English inches. We have, therefore,\n\n\\[\na = 0.0000309, \\quad c = 0.0000532 \\quad l = 39813, \\quad ah = 1.22023,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b} = 1.222, \\quad c = 1.733, \\quad v = \\sqrt{(500.5 + 3) - 1.73} = 20.71,\n\\]\n\nexceeding the observation by .19. Dubuat's formula falls short by .13 only, Prony's table by .96.\n\nIt must, however, be observed, that, in so great an extent of pipe, it is scarcely possible that some partial obstruction should not always occur, which must make the actual velocity somewhat less than the theory ought to give, so that the slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the formulae of Dubuat and Dr Young can scarcely be said to be in favour of the former.\n\nIt is, however, remarkable that in this instance, as well as in some others, a single formula, which Dr Young had published in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of Professor Eytelwein's book, is still more accurate than the more refined calculations. This formula is\n\n\\[\nv = 50 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dh}{l+50d}\\right)},\n\\]\n\nthe measures being expressed in English feet; thus, in the example here computed, this formula gives us \\(v = 20.56\\) inches. It is equivalent, for inches, to\n\n\\[\nv = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{30000dh}{l+50d}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{h}{.0000333l.d+.00166}\\right)},\n\\]\n\nwhich implies that \\(c\\) may be neglected in such pipes at least, and \\(a\\) may be taken .17 \u00d7 333, which does not greatly differ from the tabular value for the given diameter. It has happened, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of accidental circumstances, that Dubuat has been deprived of a considerable portion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> merits, in favour of Mr Eytelwein, without any kind of voluntary plagiarism on the part of this very respectable Professor. The author of the English abstract of his work was acquainted with Dubuat's book, only from having read the extracts, copied from it by Professor Robison, in his contributions to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and he was hence led into the mistake of supposing Professor Eytelwein the author of many improvements, which he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more idea of claiming, than he could have had of several modifications introduced into the Summary of Hydraulics, chiefly extracted from his book, which appeared in the Journal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, and which have been quoted as Eytelwein's.\n\nThe resistance occasioned by the flexure of a pipe, must not be neglected when any great accuracy is required in the determination of the water conveyed by it. Dr Young has pointed out the inadequacy of Dubuat's method of calculating this resistance, and his remarks may again be copied in his own words.\n\n\"Mr Dubuat,\" he continues, \"has made some experiments on the effect of the flexure of a pipe in retarding the motion of the water flowing through it; but they do not appear to be by any means sufficient to authorise the conclusions which he has drawn from them. He directs the squares of the sines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of flexure to be collected into one sum, which, being multiplied by a certain constant coefficient, and by the square of the velocity, is to show the height required for overcoming the resistance. It is, however, easy to see that such a rule must be fundamentally erroneous, and its coincidence with some experiments merely accidental, since the results afforded by it must vary according to the method of stating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, which is entirely arbitrary. Thus it depended only on Mr Dubuat to consider the arc of a pipe bent to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 144\u00b0 as consisting of a single flexure, as composed of two flexures of 72\u00b0 each, or of a much greater number of smaller flexures, although the result of the experiment would only agree with the arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> into two parts, which he has adopted. This difficulty is attached to every mode of computing the effect, either from the squares of the sines or from the sines themselves; and the only way of avoiding it is to attend merely to the angle of flexure as expressed in degrees. It is natural to suppose that the effect of the curvature must increase, as the curvature itself increases, and that the retardation must be inversely proportional to the radius of curvature, or very nearly so; and this supposition is sufficiently confirmed by the experiments, which Mr Dubuat has employed in support of a theory so different. It might be expected that an equal curvature would create a greater resistance in a larger pipe than in a smaller, since the inequality in the motions of the different parts of the fluid is greater; but this circumstance does not seem to have influenced the results of the experiments made with pipes of an inch and of two inches diameter: there must also be some deviation from the general law, in cases of very small pipes having a great radius of curvature; but this deviation cannot be determined without further experiments. Of the twenty-five which Dubuat has made, he has rejected ten\nHydraulics as irregular, because they do not agree with his theory; indeed, four of them, which were made with a much shorter pipe than the rest, differ so manifestly from them that they cannot be reconciled; but five others agree sufficiently, as well as all the rest, with the theory which I have here proposed, supposing the resistance to be as the angular flexure, and to increase besides, almost in the same proportion as the radius of curvature diminishes, but more nearly as that power of the radius of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> is \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). Thus if \\( p \\) be the number of degrees subtended at the centre of flexure, and \\( q \\) the radius of curvature of the axis of the pipe in French inches, we shall have \\( r = \\frac{pe^2}{20000q} \\) nearly, or more accurately \\( r = \\frac{0.000045pe^2q^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{q} \\). These calculations are compared with the whole of Dubuat's experiments in the following table. The mean error of his formula in fifteen experiments, and of mine in twenty, is \\( \\frac{1}{25} \\) of the whole.\n\nThe methods of computation here proposed may be illustrated by a practical example, which is of a nature very likely to be of frequent occurrence. Let the length of a pipe be 1000 feet, let it have five flexures, each equal in extent to a right angle with a radius of curvature \\( q \\) of six inches; let the height of the head of water \\( h \\) be ten feet, and let the quantity of water to be delivered be one ale hogshead, or fifty-four gallons in a minute; required the diameter of the pipe \\( d \\).\n\nNeglecting the slight difference between French and English inches, with respect to the effect of curvature, we have \\( p = 450, q^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 0.2085 \\), and \\( r = 0.0004222e^2 \\), which must be added to \\( \\frac{al}{d} \\), the coefficient of \\( e^2 \\) in the general formula. Now, since an ale gallon fills 10 yards of inch pipe, the velocity discharging a gallon in a minute by such a pipe would be 6 inches, and for 54 gallons, 324 inches; consequently, for any other pipe, of the diameter and the velocity discharging a hogshead in a minute must be \\( \\frac{34}{dd} \\). Hence we might obtain, by means of the formula expressing the coefficients, a regular equation in terms of \\( d \\) and its powers, but it would be of too high an order to be at all manageable; the very general method, termed by arithmeticians the rule of double position, affords much the readiest solution. Thus, supposing \\( d = 4 \\), we have \\( a = 0.0000306 \\) and \\( c = 0.0000556 \\), and since \\( \\frac{l}{d} = 3000 \\), the coefficient \\( al:d \\) becomes 0.0918, to which if we add 0.00171, according to the formula, and \\( r = 0.0004222 \\), we have \\( b = \\frac{1}{0.0939922} \\), and \\( e = \\frac{bel}{d} = \\frac{0.1668}{0.093932} = 1.776 \\), whence \\( v = (bh+c) - e = 8.70 \\); but \\( \\frac{324}{16} = 20.25 \\); therefore, the pipe is too small, and we must try five inches, \\( a \\) being 0.0000312, and \\( c = 0.0000507 \\); hence \\( al:d = 0.07488 \\), and \\( b = \\frac{1}{0.0770122} \\), \\( e = \\frac{0.1468}{0.0770122} = 1.901 \\) and \\( v = 9.65 \\), while \\( \\frac{324}{25} = 1296 \\). Here the differences of the values of \\( v \\) are +11.55 and +3.31, their difference 8.24 answering to a difference of an inch in the diameters. We must, therefore, add \\( \\frac{3.31}{8.24} = 0.402 \\), and the diameter required will be 5.40 inches; and if we wish for very great accuracy, we may repeat the calculation once more with this value of \\( d \\).\n\nThe remainder of the investigations contained in Dr Young's two papers are more immediately connected with Physiology than with Hydraulics; and the interesting experiments of Girard, published in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1818, relate almost entirely to the effects of temperature on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> properties of bodies possessed of different chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>.\n\n(R.T.)\nJains (called by some Joinus), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> or rather race of Hindoos, found in considerable numbers in different parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, particularly in the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>. They form a class of dissenters from the established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of Brahminism, so generally considered throughout India as alone founded on an orthodox basis. They deny altogether the authority of the Vedas, regarded by the genuine Hindoo as the holiest of books. They either disown, or sink into a subordinate station, all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> objects of Hindoo veneration. In their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> concerning the origin of the world, they have adopted opinions which seem to partake of the character of atheism. They do not, like the followers of the Vedas, acknowledge any spiritual and eternal Being, from whom the universe derived its origin. The material world, as well as the minds of all men and animals, are held by them to be eternal. They refuse to acknowledge anything which is not, or has not been, the object of the senses. Upon this principle they deny the existence of any beings superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and admit no objects of worship except men who have raised themselves by their merits to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of divinities. As, however, they set no bounds to the perfection which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> may arrive at, their most eminent saints and pontiffs (among whom they particularly celebrate Gomat Iswara Swami) partake almost the attributes of Supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>. To this station, however, they are exalted, not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a virtuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, or of benefits rendered to mankind, but of those excesses of absurd and extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> to which, throughout all India, such sovereign merit is attached.\n\nThey have three ranks of ascetics, whom they call Yatis. The first, called Anuvraata, can be attained only by him who forsakes his family, entirely cuts off his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, holds always in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> a bundle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEACOCK\">peacock</a>'s feathers and an earthen pot, and wears only clothes of a tawny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The second rank, Mahavraata, requires that all dress should be abandoned, except a mere rag to cover nakedness, and that the hair, instead of being shaven off, should be pulled out by the roots. He who aspires still higher, and seeks to attain the third degree, or Nirvana, throws aside even rags, and remains entirely naked; he eats nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, and that only once in two days. The name is nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with that of Deity, and he is held in nearly equal veneration with the priests and rajas, whose images are worshipped in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>. At Billicull, or Belligola, the residence of their high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, they have a gigantic image of Gomat Iswara Swami, the foot of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet in length, so that the height of the entire statue cannot be less than fifty-four feet; and there is a similar one at Kurcul, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANGALORE\">Mangalore</a>. This worship of gigantic images is common to them with the followers of Boodha, whom they also closely resemble in their theological tenets; nay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SAMANA\">Samana</a> and Gaudma, the main objects of Boodh veneration, are enumerated by the Jains among the earliest and most venerated of their priests. On the other hand, they differ from them entirely in being divided into four casts, distinguished from each other by the same privileges and manners as among other Hindoos. The Jains observe also similar penances, carrying them only to a greater extreme. They are also scrupulous to a still greater degree as to causing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of any living thing, even the minutest insect. The strictest Jains, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against this danger, do not eat after sunset; they have always a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROOM\">broom</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> the ground before them, and never drink water unless strained through a cloth. The orthodox Hindoos have ceremonies by which any involuntary offence of this kind may be expiated; but the Jains, not allowing the efficacy of these, have no means of relieving their soul from the burden of such a trespass. Like the other Hindoos, they consider it unlawful for the widow to marry again, but discourage the barbarous practice of sacrificing herself on the body of the husband. On the whole, it would appear that while their doctrines and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> closely coincide with those of the Boodhists, their civil and social life is discriminated only by minute shades from that of the Hindoos. They have a system of their own with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, and physics, of which we need only observe, that its tenets are still more extravagant and absurd than those contained in the orthodox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of the Vedas and Puranas.\n\nSee Asiatic Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a>, Vol. IX.\u2014Dubois on the Manners of the People of India, Lond. 1817.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">Ward</a> on the History, Literature, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a> of the Hindoos.

He died the 7th September 1799, at Bow Wood, in Wiltshire, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the Marquis of Lansdowne, who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> known and esteemed him.\n\nDr Ingenhousz's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> publications are, 1. Experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TORPEDO\">Torpedo</a>. Phil. Trans. 1775, p. 1. Mr Walsh had lately gained considerable reputation by his account of the effects of the torpedo. These experiments, which were made off Leghorn, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with Dr Drummond, are merely illustrative of Ingenhousz's observations.\n\n2.

On a New Inflammable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">Gas</a>. Phil. Trans. 1779, p. 576.

The author takes occasion to investigate the elasticity of the gas evolved by the detonation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>; and agrees with Bernoulli in estimating it as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to near 2500 atmospheres. It may here be remarked, that notwithstanding Bernoulli's general accuracy, and great mathematical talents, he has fallen into a very singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, in comparing the force of gunpowder with the daily labour of men; and has accidentally made the force of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> equivalent to the daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of 100 men, while, in fact, the force of 40 pounds is only equivalent to the daily labour of a single man.\n\n6.

Dr Ingenhouz was, on all occasions, anxious to support his claim to this very interesting discovery; and he insisted that Priestley's earlier experiments, on the green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> contained in stagnant water, had little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> nothing in common with his own, because that matter was, in fact, of an animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. He was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of collecting the gas from cabbage leaves, and of keeping it bottled up in his pocket; and he was prepared with some coils of iron wire fastened into the corks, in order to exhibit the brilliant phenomenon of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> to his friends: the public being at that time less accustomed to this dazzling exhibition, than it has become in later years, when elementary lectures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> have been more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> addressed to mixed audiences than heretofore.\n\n12. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Food of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">Plants</a>, 8vo.

It is from 50 to 75 miles in length; in breadth from 30 to 50 miles; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> is computed to be 3036 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, of which the space occupied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> has been estimated at 132 miles, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> at 2904, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 1,858,560 English acres.\n\nThe exterior outline of this county is exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>. On the north-east, where the county town is situated, a narrow tract runs out between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAIRNSHIRE\">Nairnshire</a> and the Moray Frith; farther to the east, a portion of it is detached and inclosed by the counties of Moray and Banff; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARGYLESHIRE\">Argyleshire</a> penetrates into it from the south-west; and on the west it is indented by lochs Moydart, Aylort, Nevish, Hourn, and other arms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nThe surface is still more varied, consisting of ranges of lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, alternating with deep narrow vallies, the beds of a great many lakes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. The most prominent feature is Glenmore, or the Great Glen, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in breadth, and bounded on either side by precipitous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> grounds, which traverses the county from southwest to north-east, dividing it into two nearly equal parts. In this glen, from north to south, are Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy, which, when united by a canal of about 22 miles (see CALEDONIAN CANAL in this Supplement), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> form a line of inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> between the east and west seas, or from the Moray Frith, on the north-east, to Linnhe Loch, an arm of the Atlantic, on the south-west, a distance of about 60 miles, for frigates of 32 guns, and vessels of 600 tons. Loch Ness is remarkable for never freezing, a circumstance ascribed to its great depth, and for its waters having been violently agitated during the great earthquake at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> in November 1755. On each side of this valley there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of glens and straths, separated by mountainous ridges; with lakes which receive the waters from the high grounds, and discharge them by outlets, partly into the lakes in the central valley, and partly, by a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> course, into the arms of the Atlantic on the west, or by rivers which flow from this county into the counties on the east, and thence into the German Ocean.\n\nThe western side, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> between the Divisions, great valley and the Atlantic, from Argyleshire on the south to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-ROSS_SHIRE\">Ross-shire</a> on the north, a distance of about 70 miles, is the most wild and mountainous tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>-shire, and is therefore known by the name of the Rough Bounds; yet before reaching the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, the general elevation is somewhat diminished. In this tract, beginning at the south, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> divisions are Moydart, Arasaig, Morrer, Knoydart, and Glenelg, which contain a variety of glens or vallies, among which are Glengary, Glen Moriston, Glen Urquhart, and Strathglass. The glens and most considerable lakes in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> are Loch Eil, Lochs Loch Shiel, Loch Arkeg, Loch Gary, and Loch Maddy. Lochan Uain, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Kilmorack, about 40 miles west from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAULY\">Beauly</a>, is said to have been known to remain frozen all the year through. On the east side of the valley lies the extensive district of Badenoch; at its southern termination is Lochaber; and at its northern the Aird, the most fertile part of the county. These divisions also comprise a great many glens, lakes, and rivers, extensive woodlands, and not a little productive land. The principal vallies here are Glenroy, noted for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, which it is now agreed must have been formed by the gradual subsidence of the waters, and not by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, Strathspey, Stratherrick, Strathearn, and Strathnairn. Treig, Erchit partly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERTHSHIRE\">Perthshire</a>, Laggan, Insch, and Moy, are the names of the most considerable of the lochs in this quarter; and here the Spey, the Findhorn, and the Nairn, and a number of smaller streams, have their source.\n\nThe general aspect of Inverness-shire may be further conceived, when it is stated that two-thirds of the surface is covered with heath; only a fortieth part corn land; and that the corn land, woodlands, and green pastures, together, do not exceed eight acres in an hundred. In many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tracts, heath prevails to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> that, for twelve or fourteen miles, scarcely any verdure is to be seen, except\nwhere a solitary rivulet has occasionally overflowed its banks. On the south of Badenoch, there is a flat of deep moss, supposed to be the most extensive in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, in which a great number of small lakes are interspersed, some of them containing wooded isles, where the deer, from the inaccessible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the ground, find shelter from their pursuers. But the far greater part of the county is occupied with mountains. Ben-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVIS\">Nevis</a>, 4380 feet high, stands on the south-west, a little to the east of the Caledonian Canal; Meall Fourvounie, on the west of Loch Ness, is more than 3000 feet high; and Cairngorm, partly in Banffshire, upwards of 4000. It has been remarked, as a singular circumstance, that several of the hills, which are covered with heath on the sides, are green on the summit, and produce valuable pasturage. The productive land lies chiefly on the sea coast, and along the banks of the lakes and rivers; much of it in the latter situation is alluvial and fertile: there is also clay in a few places; but the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> loam, well adapted to the growth of barley, potatoes, turnips, and other green crops.\n\nThe principal rivers of Inverness-shire are the Spey, which rises from a loch of that name a little to the east of the Great Valley, and flowing in a course from south-west to north-east for about 96 miles, falls into the sea, about eight miles east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELGIN\">Elgin</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MORAYSHIRE\">Morayshire</a>, carrying with it the waters of 1300 square miles; the Ness, which issues from Loch Ness, and, flowing through the town of Inverness, falls into the Moray Frith, after a course of six miles; the Lochy issues from Loch Lochy, and has a course of ten miles westward, till it falls into Loch Eil, near Fort-William; soon after it leaves its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> lake it is joined, from the east, by the Spean, which is remarkable for being crossed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, two of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of which are 95 feet high; and the Beauly, which has its source in the north-west, and carries the united waters of the Glass, and other two rivulets, into the Frith of the same name. The Findhorn and Nairn on the east, and the Garry and the Morriston on the west, are smaller streams. The Foyers, which flows into Loch Ness from the south, is remarkable for its celebrated falls, one of which, according to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARNET\">Garnet</a>, is 70 feet, and the other half a mile lower, 212. There are cascades not inferior to these in the parish of Kilmorack, on the waters which unite to form the Beauly, and at Loch Leven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, in the southern quarter; near which last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> there are also some remarkable caverns.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">Granite</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, slate, marble, brick-clay, abound in many parts of Inverness-shire; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> has been discovered in Ben-Nevis, and at three other places in that neighbourhood, and also in Glengary, but none of it is wrought. A vein of plumbago has been found in Glengary. A great part of the mountain Ben-Nevis is composed of beautiful porphyry. There is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> coal, and for want of it much of the limestone is of little value.\n\nFrom the trees found in great numbers, and some of them of a remarkable size, in all the mosses, there is reason to believe that this country was, at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, almost covered with wood; and at present there is a greater space covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> pines here than in all the rest of Britain. In Strathspey, it is said that three tiers of stocks have been found, directly above one another, in a moss, from which it is inferred that the deepest must have come to maturity, and been destroyed, before the one next above it was formed. In the same district, there are about 15,000 acres of natural firs, besides 7000 of planted firs and larches; and the natural woods on Loch Arkeg, in Glengarry, Glenmoriston, Strathglass, Glen Strathfarrer, and at the head of Loch Shiel, are also very extensive. Full grown trees of ash, lime, beech, oak, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, and mountain-ash, are found at Castle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">Grant</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLODEN\">Culloden</a>, and Belladrum, in the northern quarter of the county; but in most other places, the woods are in the state of coppice. The birch is in great abundance on the sides of Loch Ness, Loch Laggan, about Rothiemurchus, and in the vale of Urquhart. Part of the great Caledonian Forest extends for several miles near the boundary of this county with Perthshire. Considerable tracts have been planted, chiefly with firs and larches, particularly in the north-east, where the county town is situated, in Badenoch, and on Loch Eil.\n\nThere are several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> villages on the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a> coast, yet the sea-fishery is not prosecuted to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, partly owing, it is alleged, to the regulations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">Salt</a> Laws. But the arms of the sea, and the numerous lakes and rivers, afford an abundant supply of fish. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> occasionally visits Loch Eil; salmon yield a considerable rent on the rivers Lochy, Beauly, and Ness, and are found also in the Morrer, in Loch Insch in Badenoch, and at Invermoriston. Char is caught in several of the lochs, and flounders and sprats in the Beauly. The moors and woodlands are plentifully stocked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>,\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and roe deer, the Alpine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> hare, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> game and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PTARMIGAN\">ptarmigan</a>, grouse, partridges, &c.; and pheasants have been lately introduced. Foxes and wild cats are still numerous, and in the lakes and rivers, otters. There are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a>, hawks, and owls; and a multitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> fowls, particularly swans, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to Loch Insch, and the other lakes of Badenoch.\n\nThe territory of Inverness-shire is divided into estates of great extent, and, in proportion to the rental of the county, of great value. In 1804 more than the half, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we may judge from the old valuation, belonged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> proprietors, and as much more was held by other six, as made the possessions of these thirteen individuals equal to more than two-thirds of the whole; each of them at a medium must, therefore, have contained about 100,000 acres. In 1811, the number of estates was seventy-seven, of which fifty-seven were below L.500 Scots of valuation. The greatest proprietors are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Gordon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Moray, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Macdonald, Lord Cawdor, Macleod, Fraser of Lovat, Sir James Grant, Grant of Rothiemurchus, Mackintosh, Cameron of Lochiel, Macniel, Macpherson, Chisholm, Macdonell of Glengary, Macdonald of Clanranald, Baillie of Duff, and Forbes of Culloden, most of whom have seats in the county. The valuation taken in 1601 is L.73,188, 9s. Scots, and, in 1811, the real rent of the lands was L.195,843, 15s. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, and of the houses, L.9235, 2s. Sterling. The old valuation of the whole of Scotland,\nas fixed about the middle of last century, and which is still the rule by which county assessments are imposed, is to the actual rent of the lands alone in 1811, as L. 1 Scots is to L. 1.263 Sterling; whereas in this county, rents have risen in so much greater a proportion than in the rest of Scotland, chiefly perhaps owing to the introduction of sheep-farming, that its valuation is to its actual rent only as L. 1 Scots is to L. 2.675 Sterling; and it is worthy of remark, that this rise cannot be ascribed in any considerable degree to the outlay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> by proprietors, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> or otherwise, as in most other parts of Scotland.\n\nOf the occupiers of the land,\u2014tacksmen, small tenants, and cottars\u2014of the size of the farms, and of the rural economy of the county generally, we have little to say in addition to what we have already offered under the Highland counties of Scotland in the preceding part of this Supplement. Small spots of corn-land contiguous to the hamlets, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> ridges or lands belong to different cultivators, who used to interchange their allotments once a year, and more recently, only once in three years; a larger space of outfield beyond this, part of which is constantly cropped till it is exhausted, and then left to nature, when another part, which had been treated in the same manner, but which has been somewhat restored in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> while by the folding of cattle, takes its place; and beyond this outfield, separated from the higher grounds by a head dike, large tracts of common pasture;\u2014these, with their miserable huts, their irregular and always inefficient labour, their indolence, their poverty, present a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of what must have been the condition of the great body of the people of Scotland during the feudal ages; and which is not now, as it was then, somewhat relieved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> and protection on the one side, and respect, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, on the other.\n\nThis system, indeed, has been gradually approaching to its termination for the last thirty years, and in some parts of Inverness-shire it exists no longer in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> form. The change has been chiefly effected by the introduction of sheep, which has occasioned so many complaints, and probably much real suffering for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to many individuals; but which is likely in the end to be most advantageous to the public at large. With respect to its effect on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, one main topic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>, it has not been such as its opponents allege; for the population of Inverness-shire, any more than of the Highlands in general, has not diminished. On the contrary, its increase in this county, from 1755 to 1811, has been much greater than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HADDINGTONSHIRE\">Haddingtonshire</a> and the other merely agricultural districts of Scotland. Within that period, it has increased from 64,656 to 78,336, or upwards of 21 per cent. while that of all Scotland has been no more than 44 per cent.; and it is well known that the far greater part of this apparently general increase has been occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, and is chiefly confined to a few districts.\n\nThe principal exports are cattle, sheep, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, and slates. The corn grown in the county, chiefly bear or big, and oats, and only on the east coast wheat, is all consumed within itself, much of the bear in illicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>; as well as all the potatoes, the most important article of food for the greater part of the year; and the products of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a>. It imports coals, lime, flour, oatmeal, groceries, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> consumption. The manufactures are, bagging from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, thread, kelp to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARES\">tares</a>, a considerable extent on the west coast, with some tiles and bricks. There are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAN\">tan</a>-works, breweries, bleachfields, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-foundery; and some attempts have been made at different periods to carry on branches of the woollen manufacture.\n\nInverness, the capital of the Highlands, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> burgh, and the only town of any extent in the county, is situated on both sides of the river Ness, at its entrance into the Moray Frith. It is a place of great antiquity, but it is only since the middle of the last century that it has made regular advances to its present prosperity. Nearly all the trade and manufactures of the county are carried on here, and it is favourably situated for becoming a place of general resort for the northern counties, of which it is considered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. The population, in 1811, was 11,355. From the west sea, a few vessels come up to Fort-William, from which the exports are wool, skins, herrings, kelp, and slates. The most considerable village is Maryburgh, or Gordonsburgh, near Fort-William. Grantown is a neatly built village on the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> along the Spey, which, under the auspices of Sir James Grant, the proprietor, has made considerable progress. It contains a townhouse and prison, with a well endowed school, and a few years ago, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> was begun for carding and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> wool, and for making blankets and woollen cloths. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">Fairs</a> are held for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of cattle, sheep, and wool, at Fort-William, Beauly, Grantown, and Kingussie, and four in the year in Inverness, where there is also a well supplied market every Tuesday and Friday. An easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is now formed throughout the greater part of the county by means of the roads made under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, half the expense of which is borne by the county, and the other half is granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>.\n\nAmong the antiquities of Inverness-shire, which we can only notice generally, are the circles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUIDS\">Druids</a>, which are found in many parts of the county, particularly at Corrimony in its northern quarter; two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> mounts in the parish of Petty, supposed to have been places for administering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; round buildings, called Picts' Houses, in Glenelg, and other parts; forts, built without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, one of which, called Castle Spynie, two miles east from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Beauly, incloses a circle of 54 yards, and another in the parish of Laggan, stands on a rock, 100 yards in perpendicular height; vitrified forts on the hill of Craig Phadric, about two miles from Inverness, Dundhaidghall in Glen Nevis, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUN\">Dun</a> Thion near the river Beauly; and a variety of castles, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERLOCHY\">Inverlochy</a> Castle, a building of great extent, and unknown antiquity, on the banks of the Lochy near Fort-William, is, perhaps, the most remarkable. On a hill near Inverness, called the Castle Hill, stood\nthe castle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THANE\">Thane</a> of Cawdor, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a> is said to have murdered Duncan. It was razed by Malcolm Kenmore, who removed the town to the northward, where it now stands, granted its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>, and built a fortress on the site of the old town, which was repaired in 1715, and finally demolished in 1765. Cromwell erected a citadel at the mouth of the river Ness, which was demolished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II.\n\nThe chain of forts along the line of the Caledonian Canal has been already noticed. (See Inverness-shire in the Encyclopaedia.) Fort-George is a regular fortress, mounting 80 guns, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a> for 3000 men, which was begun in 1747, and completed in 20 years, at an expense of about \u00a3160,000. It is situated 11 miles eastward from Inverness, upon a neck of land on the Moray Frith, opposite to Fortrose in Ross-shire. Fort-Augustus, also a regular fortification, though a place of no great strength, with four bastions and barracks for 400 men, is situated at the west end of Loch Ness, nearly midway between the east and west seas. It was first built in 1730 at some distance from Loch Ness, but having been demolished by the rebels in 1745, it was afterwards rebuilt nearer the lake. Fort-William, built in the reign of William III., is situated on a navigable arm of the sea, called Loch Eil, at the southwestern termination of the great valley. Part of it is now in ruins, but it is still occupied by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of invalids. On Culloden Moor, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> heath to the eastward of Inverness, on the 16th April 1746, was fought the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> which put an end to the rebellion of 1745; the greater part of this heath is now covered with plantations.\n\nInverness-shire contains twenty-eight entire parishes, and shares other four with the counties of Argyll, Nairn, and Moray. Of these, twenty are on the mainland, and the remainder in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. Some of the parishes on the mainland, as well as in the islands, would form a square of 20 miles each. Kilmailie and Kilmorack are still larger, extending in length about 60 miles, and in breadth almost 30. Many of the inhabitants are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>, particularly in the districts of Moydart, Arasaig, Morrer, and Knoydart, on the west side. The county sends one member to Parliament, and represents the town of Inverness, along with Forres, Nairn, and Fortrose, choose one for the burghs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">Sheriff</a> holds courts at four places, two of which, Inverness and Fort-William, are for the mainland, and two more for the isles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SKYE\">Skye</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>. The population of the whole shire in 1800 and 1811 is given in the annexed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\u2014(See the Statistical Account of Scotland, and Playfair's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of Scotland; Robertson's Survey of Inverness-shire; The Beauties of Scotland, Vol. V., and the General Report of Scotland.)\n\n| HOUSES | PERSONS | OCCUPATION |\n|--------|---------|------------|\n|        |         |            |\n|        |         |            |\n\n| HOUSES | PERSONS | OCCUPATIONS |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n|        |         |             |\n|        |         |             |\n\nIODINE. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, in this Supplement, p. 15.\nJOINERY\n\nIs one of the useful arts which contributes most materially to the comfort and convenience of man. As the arts of joinery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARPENTRY\">carpentry</a> are often followed by the same individual, it appears, at first view, natural to conclude that the same principles are common to both these arts. But a closer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of their objects leads us to a different conclusion.\n\nThe art of Carpentry is directed almost wholly to the support of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> or pressure; and, therefore, its principles must be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> sciences. In a building, it includes all the rough timber-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> necessary for support, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, or connection; and its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to give firmness and stability. See the Article CARPENTRY in this Supplement.\n\nThe art of Joinery has for its object, the addition in a building of all the fixed wood-work necessary for convenience or ornament. It is the Intestinum opus of Vitruvius; and the Menuiserie de b\u00e2timents of the French.\n\nThe joiner's works are, many of them, of a complicated nature, and require to be executed in an expensive material; therefore joinery requires much skill in that part of geometrical science which treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>, and description of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, surfaces, and solids, as well as an intimate knowledge of the structure and nature of wood.\n\nIt may also be remarked, that the rough labour of the carpenter renders him, in some degree, unfit to produce that kind of accurate and neat workmanship which is expected from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> joiner.\n\nIn early times, very little that resembles modern joinery was known; every part was rude, and joined in the most artless manner. The first dawning of the art appear in the thrones, stalls, pulpits, and screens, of our cathedrals and churches; but, even in these, it is of the most simple kind, and is indebted to the carver for everything that is worthy of regard. Whether, in these monuments, the carver and the joiner had been one and the same person, we cannot now determine, though we imagine, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of joining in some of them, that this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>.\n\nDuring several centuries joinery seems to have been gradually improving, but nothing appears to have been written on the art before 1677, when Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Moxon, a Fellow of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, published a work entitled Mechanick Exercises, or the Doctrine of Handyworks. In this work the tools, and common operations in joinery, are described, with a collection of the terms then in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. It must have been a valuable work at that time, but to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> in the art it would convey little if anything that was new. Sash-windows were introduced into England sometime before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of Moxon's work, but he has not noticed them. According to the observations of Dr Thomson, this important improvement has not yet found its way into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>. (Travels in Sweden, p. 8.)\n\nAbout the beginning of the last century, several works of a most interesting kind made their appearance. Forms began to be introduced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> which could not be executed, at a moderate expense, without the aid of new principles, and these principles were discovered and published by practical joiners. As might naturally be expected, these authors had but confused notions, with a scanty portion of geometrical knowledge; and, accordingly, their descriptions are often obscure, and sometimes erroneous.\n\nThe hand-rails of stairs offered many difficulties, and an imperfect attempt to remove them was first made by Halfpenny, in his Art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a> Building, published in 1725. Price, the author of the British Carpenter, published in 1733, was more successful, and his remarks show a considerable degree of knowledge of the true nature and object of his researches.\n\nThe publication of Price's work must have produced a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> among joiners, for it was soon followed by many other works of different degrees of merit. Of these the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGLEY\">Langley</a> and Pain were the most popular.\n\nThe establishment of the principles of joinery, on the sound basis of geometrical science, was reserved for Nicholson. In his Carpenters' Guide, and Carpenter and Joiners' Assistant, published in 1792, he has made some most valuable corrections and additions to the labours of his predecessors.\n\nCorresponding improvements were also made in the practice of joinery, for which we are much indebted to the late Mr James Wyatt. This celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> kept together some of the best workmen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, who were looked up to with a degree of emulation by young men, which had a beneficial effect on the progress of joinery. But the art is still far short of perfection. We conceive that many of those operations, on which the soundness of work chiefly depends, might be done with greater exactness, and less labour, by means of tools contrived for these purposes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and certainty which have been introduced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>-making is sufficient to encourage some one to extend the same manner of mortising to joinery. (See BLOCK-MACHINERY in this Supplement.)\n\nThe principles of joinery were cultivated in France by a very different class of writers. In the extensive work of Frezier, entitled Coupe des Pierres et des Bois, 3 Vols. 4to, 1739, all the leading principles are given and explained with tedious minuteness; offering a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to the brevity of our English writers. The first elementary work on that part of geometrical science, which contains the principles of joinery, appeared in France, in 1795, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of the celebrated Gaspard\nMonge, who gave it the name of *G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Descriptive*. Much of what has been given as new in English works, had been long known on the Continent; but there does not appear to have been much, if any, assistance derived from these foreign works by any writer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to Nicholson.\n\nThe latest French work which treats of joinery is Rondelet's *L'Art de B\u00e2tir*. It is also the best foreign work on the subject that we have seen; but it is not at all adapted to the state of joinery in England. In practice, the French joiners are very much inferior to our own. Their work is rough, slovenly, and often clumsy, and at the best is confined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> effect. The neatness, soundness, and accuracy, which is common to every part of the works of an English joiner, is scarcely to be found in any part of the works of a French one. The little correspondence, in point of excellence, between their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and practice, leads us to think that their theoretical knowledge is confined to architects, engineers, &c., instead of being diffused among workmen, as it is in this country.\n\nIn cabinet-work the French workmen are certainly superior, at least as far as regards external appearance. But when use, as well as ornament, is to be considered, our own countrymen must as certainly carry away the palm. The appearance of French furniture is much indebted to a superior method of polishing, which is now generally known in this country.* For many purposes, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPAL\">copal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> (such as coachmakers use) is preferable; it is more durable, and bears an excellent polish.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> is useful in all, and absolutely necessary in some, parts of a joiner's business: but it is absurd to encounter difficulties in execution, and to sacrifice good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, convenience, economy, and comfort, merely for the purpose of displaying a little skill in that science. It is, however, a common fault, among such architects as are better acquainted with geometrical rules than with the production of visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, to form designs for no other purpose than to create difficulties in the execution.\n\nBut, when geometrical science is properly directed, it gives the mind so clear a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the thing to be executed, that the most intricate piece of work may be conducted with all the accuracy it requires.\n\nThe practice of joinery is best learned by observing the methods of good workmen, and endeavouring to imitate them. But the sooner a workman begins to think for himself the better; he ought always to endeavour to improve on the processes of others; either so as to produce the same effect with less labour, or to produce better work.\u2020\n\nWe intend, in this article, to give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and simple exposition of the most valuable principles of the art of joinery, which will, we hope, place many parts of the practice under a new point of view, and ultimately tend to improve them.\n\nCabinet-making, or that part of the art of working in wood which is applied to furniture, has little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with joinery, though the same materials and tools be employed in both. Correctness, and strict uniformity, are not so essential in moveables as in the fixed parts of buildings; they are also more under the dominion of fashion, and therefore are not so confined by rules as the parts of buildings.\n\nCabinet-making offers considerable scope for taste in beautiful forms, and also in the choice and arrangement of coloured woods. It requires considerable knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, and also that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> should be able to sketch with freedom and precision.\n\nIf the cabinet-maker intend to follow the higher departments of his art, it will be necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the different kinds of architecture, in order to make himself acquainted with their peculiarities, so as to impress his works with the same character as the rooms they are to furnish.\n\nIn as far as regards materials, and the principles of joining work, the cabinet-maker will find some useful information in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and third sections of this article. In ornamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, he may derive much benefit from Tatham's *Etchings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> Ornamental Architecture*, London, 1799; Perier et Fontaine's *Recueil de D\u00e9corations Int\u00e9rieures comprenant tout ce qui a rapport \u00e0 l'Ameublement*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1812; and, for general information, the *Cabinet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>*, and the *Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">Drawing</a>-Book* of Sheraton, may be consulted.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I.\u2014On Making Working Drawings.**\n\n1. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> we purpose to lay before the reader the most important part of the principles of describing, on a plane surface, the lines necessary for determining bevels, forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>, or any other purpose required in the practice of joinery. The limits, within which such an article as joinery must be confined, in a work like this, will not permit us to enter much into detail on the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> to be illustrated in this section; but we hope, by judicious selection, to place under one point of view the principles that are most useful to the joiner.\n\n**Projection of Bodies.**\n\n2. A clear idea of the nature of projection is so essential in making working drawings, that, in our endeavours to illustrate it, we cannot proceed from principles too simple. In the first stages of such an inquiry, experiment furnishes at once the most clear and satisfactory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, particularly to those who are not familiar with mathematical subjects.\n\nIf some small pieces of wood, or pieces of wire,\n\n---\n\n* The method of making and using the French polish is minutely described in Dr Thomson's *Annals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>*, Vol. XI, p. 119 and 371.\n\n\u2020 Descriptions of the tools, with instructions for using them, may be found in Moxon's work before quoted, and in Nicholson's *Mechanical Exercises*, Taylor, London, 1812.\nwere joined together, so as to represent the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> for example, and if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> were held between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and the surface of a plane board, then the shadow of the figure upon the board would be its projection upon that plane. From this simple experiment, it will appear, that the projection of any line placed in the direction of the sun's rays will be a point; the projection of any line parallel to the plane will be of the same length as the line itself, and the projection of any line inclined to the plane will be always shorter than that line.\n\n3. We have supposed the board to be placed at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with the direction of the rays of the sun; but, for our present purpose, it is sufficient to consider them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> perpendicularly upon it; hence it is obvious, that to project a straight line upon a plane, a perpendicular to the plane should be let fall from each end of the line, and the line joining the points where the perpendiculars meet the plane will be the projection required.\n\nWhen a projection is made upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plane, it is usually called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the body. When the projection is upon a vertical plane, it may be an elevation or a section of the body; it is a section when a portion is supposed to be cut off; and the plane of projection is usually parallel to the plane of section.\n\n4. Bodies may be divided into three classes, according to the kinds of surfaces by which they are bounded. The first class, comprehending those which are bounded by plane surfaces, such as cubes, prisms, pyramids, and the like. The second class contains those which are bounded in part by plane surfaces, and the rest by curved surfaces, as cylinders, cones, &c. The third, including those which are bounded by curved surfaces only, as spheres, spheroids, &c.\n\nThe projections of the first class of bodies will consist of straight lines; those of the second class, of curved as well as straight lines; and those of the third class, of curved lines only.\n\n5. Let ABCD, and CDEF, Fig. 1, Plate LXXXVI., be two plane surfaces, connected by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> at CD, so that while the plane CDEF remains horizontal, the plane ABCD may be placed perpendicular to it, and thus represent a vertical plane. Then, if a line be so placed in space, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> is its projection on the vertical plane, and a'b' its projection on the horizontal plane, its projection on any other vertical plane, HGEC, may be determined. This is easily effected, for we have seen, that if a perpendicular be drawn to the plane from each end of the given line, they will give the positions of the ends of the line in the projection (Art. 3). Now, the same thing will be done, by drawing a'a'' and b'b'' perpendicular to EC, and setting off the points a'' and b'' at the same height above EC respectively, as a and b are above CD, then the line a''b'' is the projection required.\n\nThe heights may be transferred from one vertical plane to another, when they are both supposed to be laid flat, by drawing the line IC, so as to bisect the angle ECD, and if cb be parallel to CD, meeting IC in c, then a line drawn parallel to EC, from the point c, will give the height of the point b'', and so may be found the height of any other point.\n\n6. In the particular case we have drawn, none of the projections represents the real length of the given line. To obtain this length, draw a'e parallel to CD, and with the radius a'b' describe the arc b'e <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> line a'e in e; draw de perpendicular to CD, cutting the projected line cb in d; join <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a>, and it is the length of the given line.\n\nThe real lengths of lines frequently are not given, therefore another general method of finding them will be found useful, and which may be stated as follows: the length of an inclined line projected upon a plane is equal to the hypotenuse of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, of which one side is the projection upon the plane, and the other side is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the perpendicular distances of the extremes of the line from the plane.\n\n7. In Fig. 2, a'b'cd represents the horizontal projection, or plan, of a rectangular surface, and the elevation ab shows its inclination; and its projection against another vertical plane, making any angle ECD with the former, or plane of elevation, is shown by a''b''c'd''. GC being perpendicular to EC, and AC perpendicular to CD, the heights may be transferred by means of arcs of circles described from C as a centre. This is a better method than that by bisecting the angle given in fig. 1; but neither of them so good, in practice, as setting of the heights with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>, or with a lath. In our figures it is desirable to show the connection of corresponding parts as much as possible; therefore, the reader will bear in mind that many of the operations we describe may be done with fewer lines when the operator is fully master of his subject.\n\n8. It may be further noticed in this place, that when a point is to be determined in one line, by the intersection of another, the lines should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> each other as nearly at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> as possible; for, when the intersecting lines cross very obliquely, a point cannot be determined with any tolerable degree of accuracy.\n\n9. A curved line can seldom be projected by any other means than by finding a number of points through which the projected line must be drawn, or finding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of tangents to the section. In giving an example of the projection of a body bounded by a curved surface, we shall select a case of frequent occurrence in practice, referring to the G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Descriptive of Monge, for more general methods.\n\nLet ABC be part of the plan of the base of a solid, fig. 3, and FED its end elevation; the upper side of the solid being bounded by the curved surface FD. This solid is supposed to be cut at AB by a plane perpendicular to the base, and our intention is to show the form of the section.\n\nDraw EH parallel to BA, and GIHE will represent the plane upon which the section is to be projected. Set off any convenient number of points, 1, 2, 3, &c. in the given curve FD, from each of these points draw a line perpendicular to ED, to meet BA; and from the points in BA, thus determined, erect perpendiculars, which will cut HE at right angles. Make GH equal to FE, and set off the points 1, 2, 3, &c. in GHE at the same distances respectively from HE, as the corresponding points 1, 2, 3, &c. in EFD are from the line ED. A curve\nbeing drawn through the points E, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, G will complete the section. In large works the joiner will often find it useful to put nails in the points, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> a regular lath against the nails; with the assistance of the lath the curve may be drawn with more regularity.*\n\nIf the curve FD were very irregular, or a mixed line of straight parts and curved ones, the same method would determine the section; all the caution required is, that a sufficient number of points should be fixed upon in the given curve; and upon the proper selection of these points much of the accuracy of the section will depend.\n\nThe angle ribs of groined ceilings, the angle ribs for coved ceilings, or brackets for large cornices, and the angle cantilevers for balconies, or other works of a similar kind, are found by this method. If FD be the cross rib of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROIN\">groin</a>, then GE will be the form of the corresponding angle rib. Also, if the angle of a room be represented by LAC, and FD be the cove for the ceiling, then GE will be the proper angle rib for such a cove.\n\nIn some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the section may be determined by means of the properties of the given curve, when the nature of that curve is known. Thus the oblique section of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> is an ellipse, and the sections of a cone are certain figures depending on the direction of the plane of section (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a>, in the Encyclopaedia); but if an architect were confined to the use of geometrical curves, there would be small scope, indeed, for a display of taste in his art, therefore the joiner must generally have recourse to the simple method we have described.\n\n10. The section of a body may often be drawn by a more simple and direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>; and yet where the principle is still the same. Thus, the section of the half cylinder ACB, in fig. 4, being compared with the process in fig. 3, will be found to be the same in every respect, excepting in the position of the parts of the figure. In fig. 4, ACB is the end or plan of the cylinder, and DE the inclination of the plane by which it is cut. Let the ordinates a 1, b 2, &c. in the plan, be drawn perpendicular to AB, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till they cut the inclined line DE. Also, draw the ordinates a' 1', b' 2', &c. perpendicular to the line DE, and make the distances a' 1', b' 2', &c. respectively equal to the corresponding distances a 1, b 2, &c. upon the plan. Through the points E, 1', 2', &c. draw the curve DFE.\n\nAs the curve DFE is an ellipse, when ABC is a circle, in that case it will be better to draw an ellipse with a trammel, or any other machine that produces the curve by a continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELLIPTOGRAPH\">Elliptograph</a> in this Supplement.) DE is the transverse, and Fe' the semi-conjugate axis of the ellipse.\n\nThe most important application of the case, in fig. 4, is to the hand-railing of a staircase, with a curvilinear well-hole, or opening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the middle. For, if Ac, or aB, show the breadth of the rail, Ac Ca B would be its plan; and De' Fa' E the form of a mould, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> mould, for cutting out the rail by, when DE is the inclination of the plank. We cannot, however, proceed directly to the subject of stair-rails without considering the development of the surfaces of bodies.\n\nDevelopment of Surfaces.\n\n11. To develope the surface of a solid is to draw, on some plane surface, a form that would cover it. If this form were drawn upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and the paper were cut to it, the paper, so cut, ought to cover exactly the surface of the solid. Now, in joinery, it is often required that a mould should apply to a curved surface; and, therefore, the development of that surface upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> material gives the form of the mould.\n\nThe covering of a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> may be found by erecting a perpendicular from the middle of one of the sides of its base, as from a in the side AB, fig. 5. Upon this perpendicular set off a C equal to the slant height of the pyramid; then, with the radius AC and centre C describe the arc A3, and set off the distance C3, C2, C1, CA, and CB, and draw the lines 32, 21, 1A, which determine the covering required.\n\nIt is obvious that we could develope a pyramid of which the base might have any number of sides, by the same method; and that a near approximation to the development of a right cone might be effected by the same means, which, in fact, is the means usually employed. But the following method of spreading out the surface of a cone will be found more correct.\n\n12. Let ABC, fig. 6, be an elevation of a cone, and ADB half the plan of its base. With the radius AC describe the arc AE, which will be the line bounding the development; and, to find the length of the arc, or rather the angle containing it, multiply 360 by the radius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">Aa</a> of the base, and divide the product by the slant height AC of the cone; the quotient will be the number of degrees in the arc AE, when the surface <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACE\">ACE</a> exactly covers the whole cone. Thus, let Aa be 12 feet, and AC 40 feet; then \\(\\frac{360 \\times 12}{40} = 108\\) degrees, and making ACE an angle of 108 degrees, we have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> ACE that would cover the cone.\n\nThis applies to the soffits of windows, where they are enlarged towards the inside, to admit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> more freely than square recesses would do. If ab be the width of the soffit, draw cb parallel to AB, and from the centre C describe the arc cd. Then half the development AEcd will be the mould for the soffit; or the form of a veneer that would cover it.\n\n13. The development of a cylinder is also of use in forming the moulds for soffits, but is still more useful in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of stairs; and, as we are\n\n---\n\n* A simple and convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for this purpose is described in the Transactions of the Society of Arts, for 1817, Vol. XXXV. p. 109.\nobliged to consider it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> with numerous sides, it is obvious that any other body of a like kind may be developed by the same means.\n\nLet ACB, fig. 7, be the plan of half a cylinder, and A'B' its height. Divide the curve ACB into any convenient number of equal parts, and let these parts be set off from C to A', and from C to B'. When the curve is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, divide the diameter AB into the proposed number of parts, and make AD equal to 3/4ths of the radius. From D through the points A and B, draw the lines DA', DB', then A'B' is nearly equal to the curve ACB stretch out; * and, by drawing a line from D through each of the divisions in AB, the line A'B' will be divided into the same number of equal parts.\n\nIn either case, erect a perpendicular from each point of division, and EA'B'F will be the development of the surface.\n\nIf we suppose A'B' to be divided into the number of steps, that would be necessary to ascend from B to A, in a circular staircase, the development of the ends of these steps may be drawn as in the upper part of the figure. The projection G of the cylinder, with the lines of the development drawn upon it, and the ends of the steps, shows the waving line formed by the nosings of the steps, and consequently by the hand-rail of a circular staircase.\n\nWhen a part of a cylinder is cut off by a plane, the line of section will be a curved line upon the development, as is shown in the lower part of the development, fig. 7. The faint lines show the manner of finding the edge of the covering, and is the same as finding a mould for a soffit formed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> cutting obliquely into a straight wall.\n\n14. In an oblique cone, the lines drawn on its surface, from its base to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a>, would be of different lengths, and as those lengths are not shown by the plan, or elevation, they may be had by means of the principle stated in art. 6.\n\nLet ABC, fig. 8, be the given cone, and AEB a plan of half its base; to find the development, produce AB, and from the vertex, C, let fall the perpendicular CD. Divide the circumference of the base into any number of equal parts, and from each point of division describe an arc from D, as a centre, to cut the line AB at 1, 2, 3, &c. From C, as a centre, describe the arcs AA', 11, 22, &c. and with a radius equal to one of the divisions of the circumference of the base, and the centre B cross the arc 55, which determines the point 5 in the development, with the same radius, and the point 5, as a centre cross the arc 44, and so on for the remainder of the arcs. Join A'C, and draw a curve line through the points A', 1, 2, &c. which gives the covering for half an oblique cone.\n\nIf the cone be cut by a plane, ab, parallel to the base, the surface Bba'A' will be the covering of a soffit for a conical arch cutting obliquely into a straight wall.\n\n15. As it often happens that there is not a sufficient space between the head of a door, or a window, and the cornice of the ceiling to admit of the same bevel being preserved at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> or top, as at the sides of the window, in such cases the soffit is made level at the crown, or with such an inclination only as will prevent the architrave cutting into the cornice of the room.\n\nLet ABCD be the plan of the space to be covered with a soffit, fig. 9, ED the arch of half the opening, which is in its proper position when set perpendicularly over the line CD; and let FC be the height of the arch over AB. Produce AC and BD to meet at G; set off cm equal to cF, and 3n equal to 3E; then draw a line through the points mn, which will give the inclination of the soffit at the highest part of it. Divide the arch ED into any number of equal parts (in our example we have only divided it into three parts), and from each point of division let fall a perpendicular to CD, meeting the line CD in the points 1, 2. Through these points draw the lines Ga, Gb, cutting the line AB in the points ab, and from each point erect a perpendicular to AB. Set off, on 3n, the heights of the points in the curve ED, and divide the line mc in the same proportion as n3, which will give the corresponding heights for the arch FD, and through the points thus found the arch FD should be drawn.\n\nMake Go perpendicular to GE cutting a line passing through the points m, n, in o, and draw lines through the corresponding points of division in the lines mc, n3, so that Go may be divided in the same proportion as n3. Draw Gp perpendicular to GD, and equal to Go, and set off upon it the same distances as are upon Go. Then, with a radius G1, and the first division on Gp, as a centre, describe an arc at s, and with a radius equal to one of the divisions of the arc ED and D as a centre, cross the arc s, which gives one point. Also, with a radius G2, and the second division on Gp, as a centre, make an arc at t, which, being crossed by an arc described with a radius, equal to one of the divisions of the arc ED, and s as a centre, determines another point in the edge of the covering. Proceed in the same manner till half the development of one edge be completed; the other edge will be obtained by drawing lines through the points s, t, u, from the corresponding points in Gp, and making sw equal to a1; tw equal to b2, &c.\n\nAs both sides are the same, the soffit mould for one side requires only to be reversed for the other side. If the soffit be level at the crown, the process may be rendered shorter; but, where it is possible to get space for a slight inclination, the appearance of the soffit is always materially improved.\n\nIf the plan of the wall be circular, find the development of the arc ED as before, and transfer the distances from CD of the points in the curved wall, to the corresponding lines in the development, in the same manner as was done to find the edge Bwry.\n\n16. The development of a sphere, or globe, can be effected only by an approximate process, as it is impossible to apply a plane surface so as to touch more than one point at a time; but various methods\n\n* This has been shown by Dr C. Hutton, in his Mathematical Tracts, Vol. I. p. 160.\nmay be employed which are useful in forming spherical surfaces.\n\nA sphere may be divided into numerous zones, the surface of each zone may be considered as that of the frustum of a cone, and developed in the same manner as has been described for a portion of a cone in art. 12. The upper part of fig. 10 shows half a sphere developed in this manner; and when it is divided into very narrow zones, the covering found by this process has some advantages, in practice, that are peculiar to it.\n\n17. The surface of a sphere may also be developed by inscribing it in a cylinder, LNMO, fig. 10, and considering a small portion, or gore, ABD, to coincide with the surface of the cylinder. Then, if the portion ABD, considered as part of a cylinder, be developed by the process described in art. 13, one gore, ABD, will be obtained, and by dividing the circumference of the sphere into any number of equal parts, and making AB equal to one of these parts, the same mould will serve for the whole of the sphere.\n\nAnother method of developing a sphere consists in supposing it to be a polyhedral, or many-sided figure, but this method has no advantage over the preceding ones, while it has the inaccuracies of both of them.\n\nIn lining and boarding domes, the position of the ribs to which the boards are to be fixed will determine the method of development that ought to be adopted; but the form of the veneers for a spherical surface may be determined by either method.\n\nTo determine the Angle formed by two Inclined Planes.\n\n18. The angle made by two planes which cut one another, is the angle contained by two straight lines drawn from any, the same, point in the line of their common section, at right angles to that line; the one in the one plane, and the other in the other.* This angle is the same as that which the joiner takes with his bevel, the bevel being always applied so that its legs are square from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARRIS\">arris</a>, or common section of the planes.\n\nIf two lines, AB and CD, be drawn upon a piece of pasteboard, at right angles to one another, crossing at the point E, and the pasteboard be cut half through, according to the line AB, so that it may turn upon that line as a joint; then, to whatever angle, CED, fig. 11, the parts may be turned, the lines EC, and ED, will be always in the same plane. Also, a line FD, drawn from any point D, in the line ED, to any point, F, in the line EC, will be always in the same plane. From these self-evident properties of planes, it is easy to determine the angle formed by any two planes, when two projections, or one projection and the development of the surfaces, are given.\n\n19. Let ABC, fig. 12, be the plan of part of a pyramid, and BD the elevation of the arris, or line formed by the common section of the planes in respect to the line EB; EB being the projection of that arris upon the plan.\n\nDraw AC perpendicular to EB, cutting it in any point E, and from E draw EF perpendicular to DB. With the radius EF, and centre E, cross EB in f; and join Af and fC, then the angle AfC is the angle formed by the planes of the pyramid.\n\nThe angle may be constructed when the plan and elevation of any two lines drawn in the planes, so as to intersect in the arris, are given, but as these projections are not often given in drawings of joiners' work, we have inserted the preceding, though it be a less general method.\u2020\n\nThe backing, or angle for the back of hip-rafter in carpentry, and of hipped sky-lights, is found in this manner; ABC being, in that case, supposed to be the plan of an angle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> or sky-light, and DB the inclination of the hip-rafter.\n\n20. To show how the angle formed by two planes may be found when the plan and development are given, let it be required to find the angle contained by the two faces of a square pyramid, fig. 5.\n\nDraw FB perpendicular to AC, and with the radius BF, and centre B, describe the arc FG. Then, with the radius DB, and centre F, cross the former arc in G, join BG, and FBG is the angle formed by two, the inclined faces of the pyramid.\n\nRaking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDINGS\">Mouldings</a>.\n\n21. When an inclined, or raking moulding, is intended to join with a level moulding, at either an exterior or an interior angle, the form of the level moulding being given, it is necessary that the form of the inclined moulding should be determined, so that the corresponding parts of the surfaces of the two mouldings should meet in the same plane; this plane being the plane of the mitre. It may be otherwise expressed, by saying, that the mouldings should mitre truly together.\n\nIf the angle be a right angle, the method of finding the form of the inclined moulding is very easy; and as it is not very difficult for any other angle, it may perhaps be best to give a general method, and to illustrate it by examples of common occurrence.\n\nGeneral Method of Describing a Raking Moulding, when the Angle and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">Rake</a>, or Inclination of the Moulding, is given.\n\nLet ABC, fig. 13, be the plan of the angle of a General Method body, which is to have a level moulding on the side AB; and this level moulding is to mitre with an inclined moulding on the side BC. Also, let CBD be the angle the inclined moulding makes with a level or horizontal line BC.\n\nProduce AB, and draw Cb perpendicular to AB; also make DC perpendicular to BC, and dC perpen-\n\n* This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> given by Professor Playfair, in his Elements of Geometry, and is better suited to our purpose than Euclid's definition.\n\n\u2020 On this subject, the reader may consult Monge's G\u00e9om\u00e9tric Descriptive, Art. 19 et 20, par. 23 and 24, 4th edition, Paris, 1820.\ndicular to BC. Set off Cd equal to CD, and join bd; then the inclined moulding must be drawn on lines parallel to bd.\n\nLet 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. be any number of points in the given section of the level moulding; from each of these points draw a line parallel to bd; and draw A6' perpendicular to bd. Set off the points 1', 2', 3', 4', &c. at the same distances, respectively, from the line A6', as the corresponding points 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. are from the line AB; and through the points 1', 2', 3', &c. draw the moulding. The moulding thus found will mitre with the given one, also supposing the inclined moulding to be given, the level one may be found in like manner.\n\nIf the angle ABC be less than a right angle, the whole process remains the same; but when it is a right angle, BD coincides with bd; and the method of describing the moulding becomes the same as that usually given; as it does not then require the preparatory steps which are necessary when the angle is any other than a right angle.\n\n22. It is in pediments, chiefly, that the method of forming raking mouldings is of use. Fig. 14 represents part of a pediment; AB is that part of the level moulding which mitres with the inclined moulding; all that part of the cornice below B, being continued along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, the lower members of the raking cornice stop upon it, and, therefore, do not require to be traced from the other.\n\nIn that part of the cornice marked AB, set off a sufficient number of points; and from each of these points draw a line parallel to the rake, or inclination of the pediment. Also, let a vertical line be drawn to each of the same points from the horizontal line rs. Make s't perpendicular to the inclination of the pediment, and with a slip of paper, or by means of arcs of circles, transfer the distances on rs to the line s't, and from the points thus found draw lines parallel to s't; the intersection of these, with the inclined lines, will determine the form of the moulding, as is indicated by the letters.\n\nWhen a pediment has a cornice with modillions, the caps of the modillions require to be traced by the same method.\n\n23. It sometimes happens, that an inclined base-moulding has to mitre with a level one at an angle; and as the same thing occurs still more frequently with other mouldings, such as cornices under the steps of stairs, &c. we shall give another example, which will serve still further to illustrate the method of proceeding in such cases.\n\nIn fig. 15, a raking base-moulding is shown, where the inclined moulding B is traced to mitre with the horizontal moulding C; and the horizontal moulding A is traced to mitre with the inclined one B. The preceding examples being understood, the lines and letters in the figure will be sufficient to show how the mouldings are traced.\n\n24. Mouldings being almost the only part of modern joiners' work, which can, in strictness, be called ornamental, and consequently that in which the taste of the workman is most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, we shall offer a remark or two that may have their use. The form of a moulding should be distinct and varied, forming a bold outline of a succession of curved and flat surfaces, disposed so as to form distinct masses of light and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. If the mouldings be of considerable length, a greater distinction of parts is necessary than in short ones.\n\nMouldings for the internal part of a building should not, however, have much projection; the proper degree of shade may always be given, with better effect, by deep sinkings judiciously disposed. The light in a room is not sufficiently strong to relieve mouldings, without resorting to this method; and hence it is that quirked mouldings are so much esteemed.\n\nSect. II.\u2014On the Construction of Joiners' Work.\n\n25. The goodness of joiners' work depends chiefly upon the care that has been bestowed in joining the materials. In carpentry, framing owes its strength to the form and position of its parts; but in joinery, the strength of a frame depends upon the strength of the joinings. The importance, therefore, of fitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> together as accurately as possible is obvious. It is very desirable, that a joiner should be a quick workman; but it is still more so that he should be a good one; that he should join his materials with firmness and accuracy; that he should make surfaces even and smooth, mouldings true and regular, and the parts intended to move, so that they may be used with ease and freedom.\n\nWhere despatch is considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> excellence of a workman, it is not probable that he will strive to improve himself in his art, further than to produce the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of barely tolerable work with the least quantity of labour. In some articles of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, despatch in the manufacture may be of greater importance; but in works that ought to remain firm for years, it certainly is bad economy to spare a few shillings worth of labour at the risk of being annoyed with a piece of bad work as long as it will hold together.\n\nWe have seen, with no small degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, the effect of encouraging good workmanship in the construction of machinery, and would recommend that a like encouragement should be given to superior workmen in other arts.\n\nJoining Angles.\n\n26. When the length of a joint at an angle is not considerable, it is sufficient to cut the joint, so that when the parts are joined, the plane of the joint shall bisect the angle. This kind of joint is shown for two different angles, by fig. 16, Plate LXXXVII.\n\nWhen an angle of considerable length is to be joined, and the kind of work does not require a jointing should be concealed, fig. 17 is often employed; the small bead renders the appearance of the joint less objectionable, because any irregularities, from shrinkage, are not seen in the shade of the quirk of the bead.\n\nA bead upon an angle, where the nature of the thing does not determine it to be an arris, is attended with many advantages; it is less liable to be injured, and admits of a secure joint, without the ap-\npearance of one. Fig. 18 shows a joint of this description, which should always be used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>.\n\nFig. 19 represents a very good joint for an exterior angle, whether it be a long or a short one. Such a joint may be nailed both ways. But the joint represented by fig. 20 is superior to it; the parts being drawn together by the form of the joint itself, they can be fitted with more accuracy, and joined with certainty. The angles of pilasters are often joined, as fig. 20.\n\nInterior angles are commonly joined, as shown by fig. 21. If the upper or lower edge be visible, the joint is mitred, as in fig. 16; at the edge only, the other part of the joint being grooved, as in fig. 21. In this manner are put together the skirting and dado at the interior angles of rooms, the backs, and back-linings of windows, the jambs of door-ways, and various other parts of joiners' work.\n\nFraming.\n\n27. Frames in joinery are usually connected by mortise and tenon joints, with grooves to receive pannels. Doors, window-shutters, &c. are framed in this manner. The object in framing is, to reduce the wood into narrow pieces, so that the work may not be sensibly affected by its shrinkage; and, at the same time, it enables us to vary the surface without much labour.\n\nFrom this view of the subject, the joiner will readily perceive, that neither the parts of the frame nor the pannels should be wide. And, as the frame should be composed of narrow pieces, it follows, that the pannels should not be very long, otherwise the frame will want strength. The pannels of framing should not be more than about 15 inches wide, and 4 feet long, and pannels so large as this should be avoided as much as possible.* The width of the framing is commonly about one-third of the width of the panel.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance, in framing, that the tenons and mortises should be truly made. After a mortise has been made with the mortise chisel, it should be rendered perfectly even with a float; an instrument which differs from a single cut, or float <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, only by having larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. An inexperienced workman often makes his work fit too tight in one place and too easy in another, hence the mortise is split with driving the parts together, and the work is never firm; whereas if the tenon fill the mortise equally, without using any considerable force in driving the work together, it is found to be firm and sound. The thickness of tenons should be about one-fourth of that of the framing, and the width of a tenon should never exceed about five times its thickness, otherwise, in wedging, the tenon will become bent, and bulge out the sides of the mortise. If the rail be wide, two mortises should be made, with a space of solid wood between; fig. 22 shows the tenons for a wide rail.\n\nIn thick framing, the strength and firmness of the joint is much increased by putting a cross or feather tongue in on each side of the tenon; these tongues are about an inch in length, and are easily put in with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> proper for such purposes. The projected figure of the end of a rail, fig. 22, shows these tongues put in, in the style there are grooves ploughed to receive them.\n\nSometimes, in thick framing, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> tenon in the thickness is made; but we give the preference to a single one, when tongues are put in the shoulders, as we have described; because a strong tenon is better than two weak ones, and there is less difficulty in fitting one than two.\n\nThe pannels of framing should be made to fill the grooves, so as not to rattle, and yet to allow the panels to shrink without splitting.\n\n28. When a frame consists of curved pieces, they are often joined by means of pieces of hard wood called keys. Fig. 23 is the head of a Gothic window frame, joined with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a>, with a plan of the joint below it. A cross tongue is put in on each side of the key, and the joint is tightened by means of the wedges aa.\n\nIt is, however, a better method to join such pieces by means of a screw bolt instead of a key, the cross tongues being used whichever method is adopted.\n\nJoining with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">Glue</a>.\n\n29. It is seldom possible to procure boards sufficiently wide for pannels without a joint, on account of heart shakes, which open in drying. In cutting out pannels, for good work, shaken wood should be carefully avoided. That part near the pith is generally the most defective.\n\nIf the pannels be thick enough to admit of a cross or feather tongue in the joint, one should always be inserted, for then, if the joint should fail, the surfaces will be kept even, and it will prevent light passing through.\n\nSometimes plane surfaces of considerable width and length are introduced in joiners' work, as in dado, window backs, &c.; such surfaces are commonly formed of inch, or inch and quarter, boards joined with glue, and a cross or feather tongue ploughed into each joint. When the boards are glued together, and have become dry, tapering pieces of wood, called keys, are grooved in, across the back, with a dovetail <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>. These keys preserve the surface straight, and also allow it to shrink and expand with the changes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>.\n\n30. It would be an endless task to describe all the methods that have been employed to glue up bodies of such varied forms as occur in joinery; for every joiner forms methods of his own, and merely from his being most familiar with his own process, he will perform his work, according to it, in a better manner than by another, which, to an unprejudiced mind, has manifestly the advantage over it. The end and aim of the joiner, in all these operations, is to avoid the peculiar imperfections and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\n\n* Pannels of external doors and shutters may be rendered more secure by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a> them, and inserting iron wires. See Trans. Society of Arts, Vol. XXV. p. 106.\nadvantages of his materials, and to do this with the least expense of labour or material. The straightness of the fibres of wood renders it unfit for curved surfaces, at least when the curvature is considerable. Hence short pieces are glued together as nearly in the form desired as can be, and the apparent surface is covered with a thin veneer; or the work is glued up in pieces that are thin enough to bend to the required form. Sometimes a thin piece of wood is bent to the required form upon a cylinder or saddle, and blocks are jointed and glued upon the back; when the whole is completely dry it will preserve the form that had been given to it by the cylinder.\n\nThe proper thickness for the pieces to be bent may be easily determined by an easy experiment on a piece of wood of the same kind as that to be used, and bend it as much as it will bear without injury; then ascertain the radius of curvature, and also the thickness of the piece, at the most curved part of it. From these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> the proper thickness for any other curve will be determined by the following proportion:\n\n\\[ \\text{radius} = \\frac{\\text{thickness}}{120} \\]\n\nThat is, a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> may be bent into any curve, of which the radius is not less than 120 times its thickness.\n\nA piece of work glued up in thicknesses should be very well done; but it too often happens that the joints are visible, irregular, and in some places open; therefore other methods have been tried.\n\n31. If a piece of wood be boiled in water for a certain time, then taken out and immediately bent into any particular form, and it be retained in that form till it be dry, a permanent change takes place in the mechanical relations of its parts; so that, though when relieved, it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> back a little, yet it will not return to its natural form.\n\nThe same effect may be produced by steaming wood; but though both these methods have been long practised to a considerable extent in the art of ship-building, we are not aware that any general principles have been discovered, either by experiment or otherwise, that will enable us to apply it to an art like joinery, where so much precision is required. We are aware that it has been tried; but before it can be rendered extensively useful, the relation between the curvature to which it is bent, and that which it assumes, when relieved, should be determined, and also the degree of curvature which may be given to a piece of a given thickness.\n\nThe time that a piece of wood should be boiled, or steamed, in order that it may be in the best state for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a>, should be made the subject of experiments; and this being determined, the relation between the time and the bulk of the piece should be ascertained.\n\nFor the joiner's purposes, we imagine, that the process might be greatly improved, by saturating the convex side of each piece with a strong solution of glue, immediately after bending it. By filling, in this manner, the extended pores, and allowing the glue to harden thoroughly before relieving the pieces, they would retain their shape better.\n\n32. Large pieces of timber should never be used in joinery, because they cannot be procured sufficiently dry to prevent them splitting with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of a warm room. Therefore, the external part of columns, pilasters, and works of a like kind, should be formed of thin pieces of dry wood; and, if support be required, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, or an iron pillar, may be placed within the exterior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>. Thus, to form columns of wood, so that they shall not be liable to split, narrow pieces of wood are used, not exceeding five inches in width. These are jointed like the staves of a cask, and glued together, with short blocks glued along at each joint.\n\nFig. 24 is a plan of the lower end of a column glued up in staves; the bevel at A is used for forming the staves, that at B is used for adjusting them when they are glued together. A similar plan must be made for the upper end of the column, which will give the width of the upper end of the staves. The bevels taken from the plan, as at A and B, are not the true bevels; but they are those generally used, and are very nearly true, when the columns are not much diminished. To find the true bevels, the principle we have given in art. 19 should be applied. The same method may be adopted for forming large pillars for tables, &c.\n\nIf a column have flutes, with fillets, the joints should be in the fillets, in order to make the column as strong as possible; also, if a column be intended to have a swell in the middle, proper thickness of wood should be allowed for it.\n\nWhen columns or pillars are small, they may be made of dry wood; and to secure them against splitting, a hole may be bored down the axis of each column.\n\nFixing Joiners' Work.\n\n33. We have hitherto confined our remarks to that part of joinery which is performed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>; but by far the most important part remains to be considered. For, however well a piece of work may have been prepared, if it be not properly fixed, it cannot fulfil its intended purpose. As in the preceding part, we shall state the general principles that ought to be made the basis of practice, and illustrate those principles by particular examples.\n\nIf the part to be fixed consist of boards jointed together, but not framed, it should be fixed so that it may shrink, or swell without splitting. The na-\n\n---\n\n* The reader will find some interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> relating to flexure in the Article Carpentry, p. 624, Vol. II.\nture of the work will generally determine how this may be effected. Let us suppose that a plain back of a window is to be fixed. Fig. 25 is a section showing B the back of the window, A the window sill, D the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, and C the skirting. The back B is supposed to be prepared, as we have stated in art. 29, and that it is kept straight by a dovetailed key a. Now, let the back be firmly nailed to the window sill A, and let a narrow piece d, with a groove, and cross tongue, in its upper edge, be fixed to bond timbers or plugs in the wall; the tongue being inserted also into a corresponding groove in the lower edge of the back B. It is obvious, that the tongue being loose, the back B may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> or expand, as a panel in a frame. The dado of a room should be fixed in the same manner. In the principal rooms of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, the skirting C is usually grooved into the floor D, and fixed only to the narrow piece d, which is called a ground. By fixing, in this manner, the skirting covers, the joint, which would otherwise soon be open by the shrinking of the back; and from the skirting being grooved into the floor, but not fastened to it, there cannot be an open joint between the skirting and floor. When it is considered, that an open joint, in such a situation, must become a receptacle for dust, and a harbour for insects, the importance of adopting this method of fixing skirting will be apparent.\n\nIn fixing any board above five or six inches wide, similar precautions are necessary; otherwise, it is certain to split when the house becomes inhabited. We may, in general, either fix one edge, and groove the other, so as to leave it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, or fix it in the middle, and leave both edges at liberty.\n\nSometimes a wide board, or a piece consisting of several boards, may be fixed by means of buttons, screwed to the back, which turn into grooves in the framing, bearers, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOISTS\">joists</a>, to which it is to be fixed. If any shrinking takes place the buttons slide in the grooves. In this manner the landings of stairs are fixed, and it is much the best mode of fixing the top of a table to its frame.\n\n34. The extension of the principle of ploughing and tonguing work together is one of the most important of the improvements that have been introduced by modern joiners. It is an easy, simple, and effectual method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, and one that provides against the greatest defect of timber work, its shrinkage. By means of this method, the bold mouldings of Gothic architecture can be executed with a comparatively small quantity of material; and even in the mouldings of modern architecture it saves much labour. For example, the moulded part of an architrave may be joined with the plain part, as shown by this figure. If this method be compared with the old method of glueing one piece upon another, its advantage will be more evident.\n\n35. The architraves, skirtings, and surbase mouldings, are fixed to pieces of wood called grounds; and as the straightness and accuracy of these mouldings must depend upon the care that has been taken to fix the grounds truly; it will appear, that fixing grounds, which is a part often left to inferior workmen, in reality requires much skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; besides, they are almost always the guide for the plasterer. Where the plasterer's work joins the grounds, they should have a small groove ploughed in the edge to form a key for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>.\n\n36. In our remarks on construction, we must not omit to say a few words on laying floors, because it will give us an opportunity of pointing out a defect which might be easily remedied. The advice of Evelyn, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TACK\">tack</a> the boards down only the first year, and nail them down for good the next, is certainly the best, when it is convenient to adopt it; but, as this is very seldom the case, we must expect the joints to open more or less. Now these joints always admit a considerable current of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and also, in an upper room, unless there be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> floor, the ceiling below may be spoiled by spilling a little water, or even by washing the floor. To avoid this, we would recommend a tongue to be ploughed into each joint, according to the old practice. When the boards are narrow, they might be laid without any appearance of nails, in the same way as a dowelled floor is laid, the tongue serving the same purpose as the dowels. In this case, we would use cross or feather tongues for the joints.\n\nThere is a method sometimes used in laying floors, which workmen call folding; according to this method, two boards are laid, and nailed at such a distance apart that the space is a little less than the aggregate width of the boards intended for it; these boards are then put to their places, and, on account of the narrowness of the space left for them, they rise like an arch between its abutments. The workmen force them down by jumping upon them. Accordingly, the boards are never soundly fixed to the joists, nor can the floor be laid with any kind of evenness or accuracy. We merely notice this method here, in order that it may be avoided.\n\nAs boards can seldom be got long enough to do without joints, it is usual, except in very inferior work, to join the ends with a tongued joint, as shown by the figure, where B is the joist. The etched board is first laid, and nailed to the joist.\n\nIn oak floors, the ends are forked together sometimes as shown at A, in order to render the joints less conspicuous.\n\nThe joints should be kept as distant from one another as possible.\n\nHinging.\n\n37. It requires a considerable degree of care to hang a door, a shutter, or any other piece of work in the best manner. In the hinge, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> should be\nperfectly straight; and truly cylindrical, and the parts accurately fitted together.\n\nThe hinges should be placed so that their axes may be in the same straight line, as any defect in this respect will produce a considerable strain upon the hinges every time the hanging part is moved, which prevents it from moving freely, and is injurious to the hinges.\n\nIn hanging doors, centres are often used instead of hinges; but, on account of the small quantity of friction in centres, a door moves too easily, or so that a slight draft of air accelerates it so much in falling to, that it shakes the building, and is disagreeable. We have seen this in some degree remedied by placing a small spring to receive the shock of the door.\n\nThe greatest difficulty, in hanging doors, is to make them to clear a carpet, and be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> at the bottom when shut. To do this, that part of the floor which is under the door, when shut, may be made to rise about a quarter of an inch above the general level of the floor; which, with placing the hinges so as to cause the door to rise as it opens, will be sufficient, unless the carpet should be a very thick one. Several mechanical contrivances have been used for either raising the door, or adding a part to spring close to the floor as the door shuts. The latter is much the better method. The reader who may be desirous of examining this method, may consult the Transactions of the Society of Arts, &c. Vol. XXVI. p. 196.\n\n38. Various kinds of hinges are in use. Sometimes they are concealed, as in the kind of joints called rule joints; others project, and are intended to let a door fold back over projecting mouldings, as in pulpit doors. When hinges project, the weight of the door acts with an increased leverage upon them, and they soon get out of order, unless they be strong and well fixed.\n\nThe door of a room should be hung so that, in opening the door, the interior of the room cannot be seen through the joint. This may be done by making the joint according to fig. 26. The bead should be continued round the door, and a common butt-hinge answers for it.\n\nThe proper bevel for the edge of a door or sash may be found by drawing a line from the centre of motion C, fig. 27, to e, the interior angle of the rebate, draw ed perpendicular to Ce, which gives the bevel required. In practice, the bevel is usually made less, leaving an open space in the joint when the door is shut; this is done on account of the interior angle of the rebate often being filled with paint.\n\nStairs.\n\n39. The construction of stairs is generally considered the highest department of the art of joinery, therefore we treat of it under a distinct head.\n\nThe principal object to be attended to in stairs is, that they afford a safe and easy communication between floors of different levels. The strength of a stair ought to be apparent as well as real, in order that those who ascend it may feel conscious of safety. In order to make the communication safe, it should be guarded by a railing of proper height and strength; in order that it may be easy, the rise and width, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a>, of the steps should be regular and justly proportioned to each other, with convenient standings: there should be no winding steps, and the top of the rail should be of a convenient height for the hand.\n\nThe first person that attempted to fix the relation between the height and width of a step, upon correct principles, was, we believe, Blondel, in his Cours d'Architecture. If a person, walking upon a level plane, move over a space, P, at each step, and the height which the same person could ascend vertically, with equal ease, were H; then, if h be the height of a step, and p its width; the relation between p and h must be such, that when \\( p = P \\), \\( h = o \\); and when \\( h = H \\), \\( p = o \\). These conditions are satisfied by an equation of the form \\( h = H \\left( 1 - \\frac{p}{P} \\right) \\). Blondel assumes 24 inches for the value of P, and 12 inches for that of H; substituting these values in our equation, it becomes \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} (24 - p) \\), which is precisely Blondel's rule. We do not think these the true values of P and H; indeed, it would be difficult to ascertain them; but they are so near, and agree so well with our observations on stairs of easy ascent, that they may be taken for the elements of a practical rule. Hence, according as h or p is given, we have \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} (24 - p) \\), or \\( p = 24 - 2h \\).\n\nThus, if the height of a step be six inches, then 24\u201412=12 the width or tread for a step that rises six inches.\n\n40. The forms of staircases are various. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, where space cannot be allowed for convenient forms, they are often made triangular, circular, or elliptical, with winding steps, or of a mixed form with straight sides and circular ends. In large mansions, and in other situations, where convenience and beauty are the chief objects of attention, winding steps are never introduced when it is possible to avoid them. Good stairs, therefore, require less geometrical skill than those of an inferior character.\n\nThe best architectural effect is produced by rectangular staircases, with ornamented railing and newels. In Gothic structures scarcely any other kind can be adopted, with propriety, for a principal staircase. Modern architecture admits of greater latitude in this respect; the end of the staircase being sometimes circular, and the hand-rail continued, beginning either from a scroll or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWEL\">newel</a>.\n\n41. When a rectangular staircase has a continued rectangular rail, it is necessary that it should be curved so as to change gradually from a level to an inclined direction. This curvature is called the ramp of the rail. The plan of a staircase of this kind is represented by ABCD, fig. 28, and fig. 29 shows a section of it, supposing it to be cut through at the line ab, on the plan.\n\nThe hand-rail is supposed to begin with a newel at the bottom, and the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> of the newel ought to be determined, so that it will mitre with\nthe hand-rail. Let H, fig. 30, be the section of the hand-rail, and ab the radius of the cap for the newel; then the form of the cap may be traced at C by the method we have already described. (Art. 9 and 10.)\n\nThe sections of hand-rails are of various shapes; some of the most common ones are too small; a hand-rail should never be less than would require a square, of which the side is 2\u00bd inches, to circumscribe it.\n\nFor the level landings of a staircase the height of the top of the hand-rail should be about 40 inches, and in any part of the inclined rail the height of its upper side above the middle of the width of the step should be 40 inches less the rise of one step, when measured in a vertical direction.\n\nTo describe the ramps, let rs be a vertical line drawn through the middle of the width of the step, fig. 29; set off ru equal to rs, and draw ut at right angles with the back of the rail, cutting the horizontal line st in t. From the point t, as a centre, describe the curve of the rail. When there is a contrary flexure, as in the case before us, the method of describing the lesser curve is the same.\n\n42. The hand-rail of a stair often begins from a scroll; and that kind of spiral, which is called the logarithmic spiral, has been proposed as the best for the purpose. It is shown by writers on curve lines, that any radial lines drawn from the centre will be cut by the logarithmic spiral in one and the same angle. By means of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the curve, it may be described as follows:\n\nLet C be the centre, fig. 31, and draw AB perpendicular to DE, crossing it in C. Bisect the angles by the lines ab, cd. Draw eBb to cut CB, at the angle proposed for the curve, and to meet Cb in b; draw eb perpendicular to be, cutting Ce in c; draw ca perpendicular to eb, cutting Ca in a; and proceed round with as many revolutions as may be required in the same manner. Then B, E, A, D, F, G, &c., are points in the curve, and the lines eb, cb, ca, ad, &c., are tangents to the curve at these points. Therefore, the curve may be either drawn by hand, or by means of circular arcs. Also, any number of interior or exterior spirals may be drawn by drawing lines parallel to the tangents, as xy, yz, &c.\n\nIf eb were to cross BC at a right-angle, the curve would be a circle.\n\n43. The scrolls and volutes, used in architecture, are always made to terminate in a circle at the centre; consequently, none of the curves described by mathematicians are adapted for these purposes. But the construction we have employed for the logarithmic spiral readily leads to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of spiral that appears well suited for scrolls or volutes. In the logarithmic spiral, the angle of the curve is constant; but imagine the angle to change regularly, and to become a right angle at the point, where the circle, called the eye, begins. This would afford us a regular and pleasing curve, unfolding itself from a circle in the centre. This curve might be called the Architectural Spiral.\n\nLet C be the centre, fig. 32, and round this centre describe a circle for the eye of the scroll, or volute. Divide this circle into eight equal parts, and draw lines from the centre through the points of division.\n\nWith any radius ac, and C as a centre, describe the arc ac, and upon this arc set off any number of equal divisions. The extent of a division must be regulated by the quantity the curve may unfold at each revolution, and the number depends on the number of revolutions.\n\nThen, beginning at A, draw Ab perpendicular to Ca; db parallel to C'; de perpendicular to Cz; ef parallel to Cs; and so on for any number of revolutions. The points A, B, D, E, F, G, and H, in the curve, and the tangents to these points, are found; therefore the curve may be described by hand, or by means of circular arcs.\n\nThe tangents to any interior or exterior spiral will be parallel to the ones first found, and, therefore, any number may be drawn with the greatest facility.\n\nNeither the logarithmic nor the architectural spiral can be drawn truly by circular arcs; but we shall here point out the principle by which such spirals may be drawn. When a spiral is drawn by means of circular arcs only, the centres of the adjoining arcs must always be upon the same straight line; and the regularity of the curve will depend on the number of arcs employed to describe one revolution.\n\nLet the proposed distance between the revolutions be divided into as many equal parts as there are to be circular arcs in one revolution; and, on the eye as a centre, construct a regular polygon of the same number of sides as the number of divisions, and each side equal to one division. Then the angles of the polygon will be the centres for describing the spiral, as shown by the figures below, where the triangle, square, and hexagon, are given as examples:\nIf a spiral be drawn to begin from a circle at the centre, let the arcs be described from the angles of a rectangular fret, as in fig. A, the sides of which may increase in any regular proportion. Or, a figure may be drawn in the same manner as the tangents of the spiral, fig. 32, and the arcs described from the angles, as in fig. B. By either of these methods a pleasing curve may be obtained.\n\nFig. 33 represents the plan of a staircase, beginning with a scroll, and having steps winding round the circular part of the well-hole.\n\nIn the first place, let the end of the steps be developed according to the method we have given in Art. 13. Fig. 35 shows this development. Now, the hand-rail ought to follow the inclination of a line drawn to touch the nosings of the steps, except where there is an abrupt transition from the rake of the winding to that of the other steps; at such places it must be curved; the curve may be drawn by the help of intersecting lines, as in fig. 36, if the workman cannot trust to his eye.\n\nThe part which is shaded in fig. 35 represents the hand-rail and ends of the steps, when spread out, and the hand-rail is only drawn close to the steps for convenience, as it would require too much space to raise it to its proper position. This development of the rail is called the falling mould.\n\nThe wood used for hand-rails being of an expensive kind, it becomes of some importance to consider, how the plank may be cut so as to require the least quantity of material for the curved part of the rail. Now, if we were to suppose the rail executed, and a plain board laid upon the upper side of it, the board would touch the rail at three points; and a plank laid in the same position as the board would be that out of which the rail could be cut with the least waste of material.\n\nLet it be required to find the moulds for the part ab of the rail, fig. 33, and to avoid confusing the lines in our small figure, the part ab has been drawn to a larger scale in fig. 34. The plain board, mentioned above, would touch the rail at the points marked C and B in the plan; draw the line CB, and draw a line parallel to CB, so as to touch the curve at the point E. Then E is the other point on the plan; and a', e', and b', are the heights of these points in the development, fig. 35.\n\nErect perpendiculars, to CB, from the points C, E, and B, fig. 34, and set off Ca, on fig. 34, equal to a'c, fig. 35; Eb equal to de', and Bb equal to fb'. Through the points C and E, draw the dotted line Ch; through ae draw a line to meet CE in h; and through the points ab, draw a line to meet CB in g; then join hg, and make Ci perpendicular to hg.\n\nNow, if Cd be made equal to Ca, and perpendicular to Ci; and di be joined, it will be the angle which the plank makes with the horizontal plane, or plan. Therefore, draw FD parallel to Ci, and find the section by the process described in Art. 10. This section is the same thing as would be obtained by projecting vertical lines from each point in the hand-rail against the surface of a board, laid to touch it in three points. The inexperienced workman will be much assisted in applying the moulds if he acquires a clear notion of the position when executed.\n\nTo find the thickness of the plank, take the height to the under side of the rail or in the development, fig. 35, and set it off from s, in the line Cr, to r, in fig. 34; from the point r draw a line parallel to di, and the distance between those parallel lines will be the thickness of the plank.\n\nThe mould, fig. 34, which is traced from the plan, is called the face mould. It is applied to the upper surface of the plank, which being marked, a bevel should be set to the angle idC, and this bevel being applied to the edge will give the points to which the mould must be placed to mark out the under side. It is then to be sawn out, and wrought true to the mould. In applying the bevel, care should be taken to let its stock be parallel to the line di, if the plank should not be sufficiently wide for di to be its arris.\nAfter the rail is truly wrought to the face mould, the falling mould, fig. 35, being applied to its convex side, will give the edge of the upper surface; and the surface itself will be formed by squaring from the convex side, holding the stock of the square always so that it would be vertical if the rail were in its proper situation. The lower surface is to be parallel to the upper one.\n\nThe sudden change of the width of the ends of the steps causes the soffit line to have a broken or irregular appearance; to avoid it the steps are made begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> before the curved part begins. Different methods of proportioning the ends of the steps are given by Nicholson, Roubo, Rondelet, and Krafft. We cannot in this place enter into a detail of these methods, but for the reader's information a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the principal writers on staircases is subjoined.\n\nPrice, in his British Carpenter, 4to, 1735; Langley, Builders' Complete Assistant, 8vo, 1738; Frezier, Coupe des Pierres et des Bois, 4to, 1739; Roubo, L'Art du Menuisier, folio, 1771; Skaife, Key to Civil Architecture, 8vo, 1774; Nicholson, Carpenters' New Guide, 4to, 1792; Carpenters' and Joiners' Assistant, Ato, 1792; Architectural Dictionary, 4to; Transactions Society of Arts, &c. for 1814; Treatise on the Construction of Staircases and Handrails, 4to, 1820; Rondelet, Trait\u00e9 de L'Art de B\u00e2tir, Tome IV. 4to, 1814; and Krafft, Trait\u00e9 sur L'Art de la Charpente, Part II. folio, 1820.\n\nSect. III.\u2014On Materials.\n\n45. There is no art in which it is required, that the structure and properties of wood should be so thoroughly understood as in joinery. The practical joiner, who has made the nature of timber his study, has always a most decided advantage over those who have neglected this most important part of the art.\n\nIn the article Anatomy, Vegetable (Supplement), Vol. I. p. 306 and 332, the structure of wood is described; in this place, therefore, we shall only show how the joiner may, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, avoid the warping caused by its irregular texture.\n\n46. It is well known that wood contracts less in proportion, in diameter, than it does in circumference; hence a whole tree always splits in drying. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> has shown that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>, a board may be cut from a tree, that can scarcely be made, by any means, to retain the same form and position when subjected to various degrees of heat and moisture. From the ash and the beech he cut some thin boards, in different directions relatively to their transverse septa, so that the septa crossed the middle of some of the boards at right angles, and lay nearly parallel with the surfaces of others. Both kinds were placed in a warm room, under perfectly similar circumstances. Those which had been formed by cutting across the transverse septa, as at A in the figure, soon changed their form very considerably, the one side becoming hollow, and the other round; and in drying, they contracted nearly 14 per cent. in width.\n\nThe other kind in which the septa were nearly parallel to the surfaces of the boards, as at B in the shrinkage marginal figure, retained, with very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>, their primary form, and did not contract in drying more than three and a half per cent. in width.*\n\nAs Mr Knight had not tried resinous woods, two specimens were cut from a piece of Memel timber; and, to render the result of our observation more clear, conceive the figure to represent the section of a tree, the annual rings being shown by circles. BD represents the manner in which one of our pieces was cut, and AC the other. The board AC contracted 3-75 per cent. in width, and became hollow on the side marked b. The board BD retained its original straightness, and contracted only 07 per cent. The difference in the quantity of contraction is still greater than in hard woods.\n\nFrom these experiments the advantages to be obtained, merely by a proper attention in cutting out boards for panels, &c. will be obvious; and it will also be found, that panels cut so that the septa are nearly parallel to their faces, will appear of a finer and more even grain, and require less labour to make their surfaces even and smooth.\n\nThe results of these experiments are not less interesting to cabinet-makers, particularly in the construction of billiard-tables, card tables, and indeed every kind of table in use. For such purposes the planks should be cut so as to cross the rings as nearly in the direction BD as possible. We have no doubt that it is the knowledge of this property of wood, that renders the billiard-tables of some makers so far superior to those of others.\n\nIn wood that has the larger transverse septa, as the oak, for example, boards cut as BD will be figured, while those cut as AC will be plain.\n\n47. There is another kind of contraction in wood whilst drying, which causes it to become curved in the direction of its length. In the long styles of framing we have often observed it; indeed, on this their length account, it is difficult to prevent the style of a door, hung with centres, from curving, so as to rub against the jamb. A very satisfactory reason for this kind of curving has been given by Mr Knight,\u2020 which also points out the manner of cutting out wood, so as to be less subject to this defect, which it is most desirable to avoid. The interior layers of wood, being older, are more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> and solid than the exterior layers of the same tree; consequently, in drying, the\n\n---\n\n* Philosophical Transactions, Part II. for 1817, or Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, Vol. I., p. 437.\n\u2020 Ibid.\nlatter contract more in length than the former. This irregularity of contraction causes the wood to curve, in direction of its length, and it may be avoided by cutting the wood so that the parts of each piece shall be as nearly of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> as possible.\n\n48. Besides the contraction which takes place in drying, wood undergoes a considerable change in bulk with the variations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. In straight grained woods the change in length is nearly insensible, hence they are sometimes employed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> rods; but the lateral dimensions vary so much, that a wide piece of wood will serve as a rude hygrometer.\u2020 The extent of variation decreases in a few seasons, but it is of some importance to the joiner to be aware, that, even in very old wood, when the surface is removed, the extent of variation is nearly the same as in new wood.\n\nIt appears, from Rondelet's experiments,\u2021 that in wood of a mean degree of dryness, the extent of contraction and expansion, produced by the usual changes in the state of the atmosphere, was,\n\nin fir wood, from $\\frac{1}{360}$ to $\\frac{1}{75}$ part of its width;\n\nand, in oak, from $\\frac{1}{412}$ to $\\frac{1}{84}$ part of its width.\n\nConsequently, the mean extent of variation in fir is $\\frac{1}{124}$, and, in oak, $\\frac{1}{140}$; and, at this mean rate, in a fir board about $12\\frac{1}{2}$ inches wide, the difference in width would be $\\frac{1}{10}$th of an inch. This will show the importance of attending to the maxims of construction we have already laid before the reader; for, if a board of that width should be fixed at both edges, it must unavoidably split from one end to the other.\n\n49. The kinds of wood commonly employed in joinery are, the oak, the different species of pine, mahogany, lime-tree, and poplar.\n\nOf the oak, there are two species common in this island; that which Linnaeus has named Quercus robur is the most valuable for joiners' work; it is of a finer grain, less tough, and not so subject to twist as the other kind. Oak is also imported from the Baltic ports, from Germany, and from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. These foreign kinds being more free from knots, of a straighter grain, and less difficult to work, they are used in preference to our home species. Foreign oak is also much used for cabinet-work, and lately, the fine curled oak, that is got from excrencences produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLARD\">pollard</a>, and other old trees, has been used with success in furniture. When well managed it is very beautiful, and makes a pleasing variety. It is relieved by inlaid borders of black or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> wood, but these should be sparingly used. Borders of inlaid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, with small black lines, give a rich effect to the darker coloured kinds.\n\nThe greater part of joiners' work is executed in fir, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> fir, imported from the north of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; white fir is often used for internal work, and American pine is much used for mouldings.\n\nThe forest of Braemar, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABERDEENSHIRE\">Aberdeenshire</a>, furnishes yellow fir of an excellent quality, little inferior to the best foreign kinds.\n\nFor the general purposes of joinery, the wood of larch seems to be the best; this useful tree thrives well on our native hills. We have seen some fine specimens of this wood from Blair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHOL\">Athol</a>. It makes excellent steps for stairs, floors, framing, and most other articles.\n\nMahogany, in joinery, is used only where painted work is improper, as for the hand-rails of stairs, or for the doors and windows of principal rooms. For doors, it is not now so often used as it was formerly; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is found to be too gloomy to be employed in large masses. In cabinet-work it is almost the only kind employed for ornamental work.\n\nLime-tree, and the different species of poplar, make very good floors for inferior rooms, and may often be used for other purposes in places where the carriage of foreign timber would render it very expensive. Lime-tree is valuable for carved work, and does not worm-eat; but carving is, at present, seldom used in joinery.\n\nFor farther information on wood, in addition to the works referred to, the reader may consult Evelyn's Silea, Dr Hunter's edition; Duhamel, Du Transport, de la Conservation, et de la Force des Bois, Paris, 1767; Barlow's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Strength and Stress of Timber, 1817; Tredgold's Elementary Principles of Carpentry, Sect.

When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> at Paris, he communicated various essays to the Academy, which are printed in its M\u00e9moires. These are chiefly botanical, illustrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the qualities of various exotics, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> not well known; but he has given several papers also, on extraneous fossils, and a few other subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. He furnished the two Appendices to Tournefort's Institutiones Rei Herbariae, and edited the Icones of Barrelier. He also published a historical account of the magnificent collection of drawings of plants of animals, originally begun under the auspices of Gaston <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the present times.\n\nWhen Linnaeus visited Paris in 1738, he, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Haller, mentioned this, the elder, Jussieu, as \"much engaged in medical practice, well versed in the knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of plants, though too prone to multiply them, and strictly confined to the...\"\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and principles of Tournefort.\" In one important point, however, which could hardly escape Linnaeus, and ought not to be forgotten, he emancipated himself from the errors of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, for he perfectly understood, and fully admitted, the doctrine of the sexes of plants. A letter of his, completely explaining this phenomenon, on the most correct principles, is given by Bradley, in his Philosophical Account of the Works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a>, p. 25-32.\n\nHe died of an apoplectic fit, at Paris, April 22, 1758, aged 72.\n\n(J. J.)\n\nJussieu (Bernard de), younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the preceding, and like him a Physician, and a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, was still more devoted to the philosophical as well as practical study of botany, and ranks among the greatest names in that science, as having first attempted to form a system, according to the natural affinities of plants. He was born at Lyons in 1699, and appears to have accompanied, or followed, his brother to Paris, where he occupied, under him, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of botanical demonstrator, in the Jardin du Roi, and at length succeeded him as Professor of Botany. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> his communications to the Academy were less numerous than those of his brother, they were of a rather superior character. In one of them, published in the M\u00e9moires of that body for 1742, he enters on the subject, then scarcely touched by any person, of the animal nature of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> productions, previously taken for plants; and we perceive, in his inquiries, dawns of that meridian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, which our countryman Ellis afterwards threw on these curious tribes. On other occasions he explained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of the Littorella, and, with much acuteness, the more obscure fructification of the Pilularia. He wrote, in conjunction with the learned Comte de Caylus, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPYRUS\">Papyrus</a>, and he gave an improved edition of Tournefort's History of the Plants about Paris, in 1725.\n\nLinnaeus became personally acquainted with this ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> at Paris, in 1738, and maintained, for some years, an intimate correspondence with him. They could not be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in each other's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> without discussing the natural affinities of plants, a study which seems to have been much advanced, if not first excited, in the mind of Linnaeus, by his correspondence with Haller. Bernard de Jussieu had, about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by his own contemplations, probably, been led to consider it; for the system of Tournefort, in which he was educated, is too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> in principle to have given him any such ideas. In its execution, indeed, that great author is led, by his own good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, into some natural and philosophical views, in spite of his system; and these may possibly have caught the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of Jussieu. However this may be, mutual satisfaction, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> instruction, could not but flow from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of Bernard de Jussieu and Linnaeus. They traced out together the characters and the limits of various natural assemblages, or orders. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> produced, and every letter communicated, some new discovery. But as the multifarious hordes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> appear originally to have used one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> tongue, which, after they were dispersed, divided, and cultivated, when it came to be written, assumed the form of various distinct languages; so these two botanical philosophers, when their more intimate intercourse had ceased, pursued different paths, and went far towards different conclusions. Linnaeus, after throwing the whole vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, more or less completely, into natural groups, became more and more persuaded, that it was not only impracticable to connect them by one synoptic clue, or system, but that not one of his assemblages, or orders, was capable of precise and unexceptionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Bernard de Jussieu, to the last, aimed at a general scheme of classification, though he accomplished little more than throwing his several orders into larger assemblages, and disposing the whole, as indeed Linnaeus himself has done, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, according to their relationship to each other. The French botanist is recorded to have spoken with great diffidence of his own performance, and has written nothing of a general classification. But he often gave hints, in lectures or conversation, by which others perhaps have profited. This appears from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to the Genera Plantarum of his distinguished nephew, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTOINE\">Antoine</a> Laurent de Jussieu, the present Botanical Professor at Paris, who, following up the ideas of his uncle, and sacrificing something to technical convenience, at the expense of nature, has contrived to exhibit a tolerably natural system, founded on methodical principles.\n\nIt would be to little purpose to discuss, at the present day, the claims of Linnaeus or of Bernard de Jussieu to originality in the study of natural orders. Professor De Candolle has justly asserted, that they had the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in view, and adopted, in the main, the same principles. B. de Jussieu, in a letter, dated February 15, 1742, congratulating Linnaeus on his appointment to the botanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> at Upsal, says, \"Flora devotus omnium poteris viam quam monstrasti facilem amplius aprire, naturaliique methodum tandem persicere, quam desiderant et expectant botanophylfi omnes.\" In a subsequent letter of May 7, 1746, he tells his Swedish friend, \"Scio quantum emolumentum reciperint qui secundum tua principia student; memet experientia docuit.\" This is enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the question, though great allowance is, perhaps, due to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> of Jussieu, who was less disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> himself than his friend.\n\nHis biographer, the celebrated Marquis de Condorcet, records his singularly amiable and unaffected manners. These, during his occupation of arranging, according to natural classes, the garden of Trianon, attracted the notice and esteem of his sovereign, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XV. to whom any unsophisticated character, or object, could not but form an agreeable relaxation from the routine of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. Jussieu obtained plants and seeds to be sent to his friend in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s name. He pursued his innocent and useful studies till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened in 1777, in his 79th year.\n\nA compendious view of his nephew's system, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of their Natural Orders with those of Linnaeus, may be seen under the article Botany, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of this Supplement. (J. J.)\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KALEIDOSCOPE\">Kaleidoscope</a>, an optical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, invented by Dr Brewster, which, by a particular arrangement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a>, or reflecting surfaces, presents to the eye, placed in a certain position, symmetrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of images, remarkable for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and the infinite variations of which they are susceptible. The name is derived from the Greek words \\(\\text{\\textit{kalos}},\\) beautiful, \\(\\text{\\textit{idos}},\\) a form or appearance, and \\(\\text{\\textit{skopeo}}\\) to see.\n\nThe effect of combining two or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> mirrors, so as to produce a multiplication of images, had long been known and described by writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>. Baptista Porta, in his \\textit{Magia Naturalis}, gives an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of an instrument, which he calls \\textit{polyphanton}, in which two rectangular specula are united by two of their sides, so that they may be opened or shut like a book, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> varied; and also of a polygonal speculum, consisting of several mirrors arranged in a polygon, for multiplying in different directions the images of objects. Kircher, also, in his \\textit{Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae}, describes, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of his own, the former of these constructions, and distinctly traces the relation between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of inclination of the mirrors, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of images formed. The very same contrivance was afterwards adopted by Bradley for the purpose of assisting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> of garden plots and fortifications; and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> that, \"from the most trifling designs, we may, by this means, produce some thousands of good draughts.\" But the particular application of this principle in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> where the two reflectors are inclined to one another at a small angle, so as to form a series of symmetric images, distinctly visible only in a particular position of the eye, was a discovery reserved for Dr Brewster. The first idea of this remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> occurred to him in the course of some experiments in which he was engaged on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLARISATION_OF_LIGHT\">polarisation of light</a>, during the year 1814. But the only circumstance which at that time attracted his attention, was the circular arrangement of the images of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> round a centre, and the multiplication of the sectors formed by the extremities of the plates of glass, between which the light had undergone several successive reflections. In repeating, at a subsequent period, some experiments of Mr Biot on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of homogeneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> upon polarised light, and in extending them to other fluids which he had not tried, Dr Brewster happened, for greater convenience, to place them in a triangular trough, formed by two plates of glass, cemented together by two of their sides, so as to form an acute angle. The ends being closed up with pieces of plate glass cemented to the other plates, the trough was fixed horizontally, for the reception of the fluids. The eye being necessarily placed without the trough, and at one end, some of the cement which had been pressed through between the plates at the object end of the trough, appeared to be arranged in a remarkably regular and symmetrical manner. Pursuing the hint thus obtained, and investigating the subject optically, he discovered the leading principles of the kaleidoscope, in so far as the inclination of the reflectors, the position of the object, and that of the eye, were concerned. He then constructed an instrument in its simplest form, and showed it to some of the members of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, who were much struck with the beauty of its effects. Several very material improvements were subsequently made by the inventor in the construction and application of the instrument, for which he then took out a patent. But, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of one of these instruments having found its way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, its properties became generally known before any number of the patent kaleidoscopes could be prepared for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. It very quickly became popular; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> it excited in London throughout all ranks of people was astonishing. Kaleidoscopes were manufactured in immense numbers, and were sold as rapidly as they could be made. The instrument was in everybody's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and people were everywhere seen, even at the corners of streets, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through the kaleidoscope. It afforded delight to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> as well as the rich; to the old as well as the young. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">Large</a> cargoes of them were sent abroad, particularly to the East Indies. They very soon became known throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and have been met with by travellers even in the most obscure and retired villages in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. Dr Brewster states, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fewer than two hundred thousand kaleidoscopes were sold in London and Paris in the space of three months; \"and yet,\" says he, \"out of this immense number there is, perhaps, not one thousand constructed upon scientific principles, or capable of giving anything like a correct idea of the power of the kaleidoscope; and of the millions who have witnessed its effects, there is perhaps not one hundred who have any idea of the principles upon which it is constructed, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which those effects are produced.\" To convey a knowledge of these principles is the object of the present article.\n\nIt follows from the optical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the equality of the angles of which the incident and reflected rays make with a line perpendicular to the reflecting surface, which it faces at the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> (see \\textit{Encyclopaedia, Optics, \u00a7 169, 172}), that rays which diverge from any object and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on a plane surface, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, after reflection, proceed in the same course as if they had immediately diverged from a point situated at the same distance behind the reflecting surface as the radiant point is before it. This point is called the virtual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of those rays; and the eye receiving them will have the perception of a reversed image of the object in this situation. Thus the mirror \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">AA</a>'\\) (Plate XCIII. fig. 1) will produce a reversed image of the object \\(R\\), situated at the point \\(S\\), in the line \\(RpS\\), perpendicular to the surface of the mirror; and this image will appear in the same place what-\never be the situation of the eye, as E, provided the reflected rays rE meet it.\n\nSince the course of the reflected rays is the same as if they had immediately proceeded from a real object of S, where its image is seen, this image will, with relation to another mirror, have all the effect of a real object; and a second reflection of the rays by a new mirror at BB', will produce, at the point T, equally distant from BB' as S is, but on the other side of it, an image of the first image, visible to the eye at E by the twice reflected rays RqvE. As the first image was reversed with respect to the object, so the second image will be reversed with respect to the first, and therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> when compared with the object. The second image may, it is evident, by a new reflection from the first mirror, give rise to a third, which will now again, like the first image, be reversed; and so on, in succession, may a series of images alternately reversed and direct, be produced on each side by two mirrors only, in consequence of multiplied reflections, provided the mirrors are of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to admit of them, and provided the eye be so placed as to receive the rays which are last reflected.\n\nIf the mirrors be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other (see fig. 2), the images of the intervening objects, AA'BB', will be ranged in succession in a continued line on each side. If they be somewhat inclined to each other (as in fig. 3), the images will be disposed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a circle, having for its centre the point in which the directions of the mirrors unite. If the mirrors be of sufficient length, or sufficiently inclined, so as actually to meet; and if, moreover, the angle they form be an even aliquot part of a circle, the images of all the objects situated in the space between them, ABC, fig. 4, will together occupy a circular field, and will be disposed in the form of sectors all round the circle.\n\nThis circular arrangement of the images, however legitimately it may have been deduced from the simplest law of optics, appears to be so extraordinary an illusion of the sense, as to call for somewhat further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> before we can feel perfectly assured that it is a necessary consequence of that law. Perhaps the most satisfactory method of prosecuting their examination is to investigate separately the mode in which each of the images results from the successive reflections by the two mirrors.\n\nA very simple and convenient rule may be laid down for enabling us to trace the whole course, however complex, of the rays which form these images; and this rule will be best understood by considering, as an example, its application to one of the remote images in the circular field. Thus, in the circular field, AHL, fig. 5, divided into equal sectors by the radii CF, CG, CH, &c. let S be one of the remoter images of the object R, formed by four reflections from the mirrors AC, BC; and let E be the place of the eye. Draw the line ES, intersecting the radii already mentioned in P, Q, T, V; make Cg equal to CQ, and join Pg; make Ct equal to CT, and join gt; make Cv equal to CV, and join tv, and vR. Then Rtvq PE will be the real course of the rays, by which the image of R is seen at S by the eye at E; for it is sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a formal demonstration, that by this construction, the equality of the angles of incidence and reflection is everywhere preserved. The different positions of the line PS, that is PQ, QT, TV, and VS, are in fact the images of Pg, gt, tv, and vR respectively, which are so many portions of the real course of the reflected rays. It is evident that a similar construction will, in every other case, furnish us with the actual course of all the rays from which images result, through all their successive stages of reflection; and it has also the advantage of giving us the exact angles of incidence and reflection throughout the whole path.\n\nWe have hitherto, for the sake of perspicuity, supposed both the object and the eye, together with the path of the rays, to be in the same plane. But it is obvious that the same method of construction and of reasoning may be employed in tracing their course, if we suppose the mirrors to be prolonged in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> perpendicular to the plane of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and the eye raised above that plane. The space between the mirrors, instead of being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> of a circle merely, is now the sector of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>; which cylinder may be completed by supplying the other sectors which compose it, as is represented in fig. 8, where ACac and BCbc being the mirrors, the rest of the cylindrical space is occupied by complementary sectors. The course of the rays by which the eye at E will see the image S, for instance, of the object R, may readily be traced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a straight line from E to S, which will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through as many planes BCbc, &c., as the rays have suffered reflections. The portions of the line ES, intercepted between these planes, may, as in the former case, be regarded as the images (either reversed or direct, as the case may be) of some portion of the actual path of the rays between the mirrors; A will occupy the same position with regard to the complementary sector it traverses, as the real path does in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sector bounded by the mirrors. By drawing, in this sector, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> similarly situated with respect to its sides, at the several portions, PQ, QT, TS of the line ES, are with respect to the sides of their respective sectors, we obtain the real course of the rays, RtvqPE.\n\nSymmetry appears to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> constituent creation of beauty in the forms given to the various works of symmetrical art which have exercised the skill and ingenuity of man; and the richness of each individual ornament, as well as the pleasing effect of the whole assemblage, is generally in proportion as this principle has received a more perfect development. Even nature, in the multitude of forms with which she has invested the different tribes of the animal creation, has, with but few exceptions, followed the law of symmetry, in as far as respects the perfect similarity of the two sides of the body. In almost all the higher classes, or those which are comprehended under the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of vertebrated animals, and in many of the inferior tribes, as in insects, one half of the animal form is the reflected image of the other half. A still higher degree of beauty, derived from a more extended symmetry of form, has been displayed in the structure of objects in the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Flowers, in particular, derive a peculiar\nbeauty from their presenting to the eye a symmetrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of forms with reference to a common centre. This is also the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> followed in the structure of radiated animals, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>-fish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ANEMONE\">anemone</a> are examples. In those works of art in which there is the greatest scope for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of fancy in the production of pleasing effects, the most perfect and successful kinds of ornament are those resulting from a symmetrical arrangement of parts; which is not confined to a single lateral repetition, but is extended in various directions in space, and is multiplied and alternated in different lines, and around different centres. It is the latter of these combinations, more especially, that is represented by the kaleidoscope, namely, the disposition of a certain number of pairs of images symmetrically disposed around one or more centres.\n\nOn examining the subject more minutely, we find that the first element of this symmetry consists in the union of any particular form, or of its direct image, with its reversed image, by which a new form is created, composed of two simple forms similar to each other, and similarly situated with respect to a given line. If a succession of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> forms be now arranged around a centre, they will combine into a perfect whole, in which all the similar parts are brought into union, and which must thus afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, by enabling the mind readily to take in and comprehend every part at a single glance. The operation of the kaleidoscope is, in this way, to create regularity and symmetry out of every form that is presented to it, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> in itself that form may be. Thus, out of the few simple lines contained in fig. 9, the appearance presented in fig. 6 is created by the instrument. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the original lines, which occupy the sector between the mirrors, are seen by direct vision, and that their appearance unites itself on each side with their images seen by reflection. We shall in future designate the whole of the appearance thus produced by the kaleidoscope, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Spectrum.\n\nIf we examine the effect produced by each element of polygons, we shall find that any straight line reaching directly across the sector, as \\( \\overline{fg} \\) (fig. 9), is formed by the kaleidoscope into a regular polygon, having as many sides as the numbers into which the circular field is divided: if it be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles to either of the sides, the polygon will have only half the number of sides. A line, as \\( \\overline{mn} \\), crossing the field between the mirrors in an oblique direction, is converted by the instrument into a polygon of the same number of sides as the former, but with salient and re-entering angles; that is, into the form of a star, with a number of rays equal to half the number of sectors. Another line crossing the field in an opposite direction, gives another star, having its rays intermediate to those of the former. Curved lines form by their union a multitude of beautiful and elegant figures, of which the variety is inexhaustible. Each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>, taken separately, possesses its peculiar and intrinsic beauty; but the effect of the whole assemblage is considerably heightened by the combination, and by the regularity of the relations that each part bears to all the others.\n\nHaving thus given an account of the general principles upon which the kaleidoscope is constructed, and of the mode in which it acts, we are now prepared to direct our attention to the conditions which are required for the perfect performance of its functions.\n\nIf the mirrors of the kaleidoscope could reflect the whole of the light which falls upon them, the light images would possess the same degree of brilliancy as the objects from which they are derived; and their number would be limited only by the more or less favourable position of the mirrors, and of the eye with relation to the objects. But as a very large portion of the incident light is, in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, destroyed by reflection, it follows that each successive image will be fainter than that which preceded it; and that in the progress of the reflections we must very soon arrive at a limit beyond which they become no longer visible. It is found, from experiment, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of light lost by reflection is in all cases greatest when the rays fall perpendicularly on the mirror, and least when they fall with the greatest obliquity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is more considerable in the case of glass, than in that of metallic surfaces. Thus, in a common looking-glass, the images of objects seen by holding it directly opposite to them, are produced wholly by the surface of the quicksilver, those reflected by the glass being too faint to occasion any interference. If the glass be placed obliquely, so that the angles of incidence and reflection be large, a greater proportion of light will be reflected from the glass, and the images formed by it will be bright enough to be seen, and will mix themselves with the images from the quicksilver. At a certain angle, both sets of images will appear of equal brightness; and by still further increasing the obliquity, those produced by the quicksilver will gradually fade away, and vanish, leaving the images produced by the glass perfectly distinct, and nearly as brilliant as the objects themselves.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, abridged from one given by Dr Brewster, and founded on the experiments of Bouguer, shows the number of rays reflected from plate glass at various angles of incidence, the number of incident rays being supposed to be 1000.\n\n| Complement of the angles of incidence | Rays reflected out of 1000 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2\u00b0                                  | 584                      |\n| 5\u00b0                                  | 543                      |\n| 7\u00b0                                  | 474                      |\n| 10\u00b0                                 | 412                      |\n| 12\u00b0                                 | 356                      |\n| 15\u00b0                                 | 299                      |\n| 20\u00b0                                 | 222                      |\n| 25\u00b0                                 | 157                      |\n\nWith the help of this table, and the method above explained of tracing the course of the rays, and investigating the angles of incidence, the degree of illumination of any part of the spectrum might be...\ncalculated, were it not for a new condition, termed polarization, with which the rays of light are affected by reflection, and which may also contribute to the further loss of light, when the reflection is repeated at certain angles, and in certain positions of the plane in which it takes place: a circumstance which is not without its influence in the case of the kaleidoscope, especially in those constructed with glass mirrors.\n\nAs the effect which the kaleidoscope is intended to produce is to be the result of repeated reflections, it is an object of essential importance, in order that as little light may be lost as possible, that all these reflections should take place with the greatest obliquity. With this view, the mirrors should be of considerable length, and the eye should be raised above the field of view, and brought as near as possible to the planes of the mirrors; that is, as near as possible to the remote end of the line of their intersection. From this situation the remoter sectors will be seen by a greater quantity of light than from any other; and consequently the illumination of the spectrum will be more equal in every part. This position of the eye affords the further advantage of giving to the spectrum a circular appearance: for it is obvious, that if viewed from any other and more oblique situation, it would, from the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, appear more or less elliptical. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the eye cannot be mathematically in the line of junction of the mirrors, for no light would in that case reach it by reflection from them.\n\nThe essential parts of the kaleidoscope, then, are the two mirrors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACE\">ACE</a>, and BCE, (fig. 10), which should be from six to ten inches in length, and from one inch to an inch and a half in breadth at the object end C; while they are made narrower at the other end, E. They are kept apart at their upper edges, and united along their lower edges CE, so as to form an angle which must be an even aliquot part of a circle. The angles $36^\\circ$, $30^\\circ$, $25^\\circ$, $22^\\circ$, $20^\\circ$, or $18^\\circ$, which divide the circumference of the circle respectively into $10$, $12$, $14$, $16$, $18$, and $20$ equal parts, are the only angles which can conveniently be employed with glass mirrors. The objects to be viewed must occupy the space ABC, between the ends of the mirrors, and must be situated in the plane formed by these lines. They are to be viewed from the opposite, or narrow end, E; the eye being placed near to the angular point, E, formed by the junction of the ends of the mirrors. It should, however, be a little above this point, in order that a sufficient quantity of light may enter through the pupil. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, the proper distance at which the maximum of illumination is obtained will easily be found.\n\nIt is of considerable importance that the junction of the mirrors be a perfectly straight line, free from roughness, and from particles of dust. Any irregularity in this line will interfere with the perfection of the image at that part most remote from the object. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of this line of junction of the mirrors on the field of view is a line CD, fig. 4, immediately opposite to the middle of the space between the mirrors. If tolerable pains have been taken to apply a straight and smooth edge of one mirror upon the surface of the other, and to preserve them clean, this line will scarcely be seen, more especially as the greater part of it is placed much nearer than the objects contemplated, and lies, therefore, within the distance to which the refractive powers of the eye are adapted: it is, therefore, seen only indistinctly.\n\nAny deviation in the angle formed by the mirrors Angle of from that which accurately divides the circle into an their inclination number of sectors, is quickly perceived by the eye, from the consequent irregularity which takes place in the compound figure of the spectrum at the part most remote from the object. This is illustrated by fig. 7, where the last ray of the star is seen to be imperfect, from the want of correspondence in the images which meet in the remote sector. If the angle be too small, the image is redundant, from a reduplication of one portion; if too large, the image presents a deficiency. But, in consequence of the aperture of the pupil being of sufficient size to admit portions of the images from both mirrors, reflected from the parts immediately adjacent to the line of their junction, these two images will be, for a certain space, seen in the same direction, and will consequently overlap and interfere with each other. As soon as the angle of the mirrors is rendered correct, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> images coalesce into one, and perfect symmetry is restored to the spectrum. It is necessary to observe, that the angle must be an even aliquot part of a circle; that is, must divide it into an even number of equal parts. If the division were into an odd number of parts, as in fig. 7, the discordance of the adjacent images at the remote sectors would be the greatest possible. This will appear from considering that the images in the successive sectors on each side, being alternately reversed and direct, those in the sectors immediately adjacent to the radius most remote from the mirrors, would both be of the same kind; the one, therefore, could not be the reverse of the other, a relation which, as we have already seen, is the elementary condition of symmetry in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of images. The corresponding parts of each, indeed, instead of being adjacent, would then be the most remote from one another. This circumstance, namely, the necessity of the angle of the mirrors being the even aliquot part of a circle, although it be an essential condition of the instrument, is not mentioned in the specification of Dr Brewster's patent. It was first noticed by the author of this article, in the Annals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>.\n\nIf we investigate the proportion of light distributed over the field of view, by considering the degrees of the obliquity with which the rays infringe upon the mirrors, and also the number of reflections which they sustain, we shall find that it diminishes nearly in the same proportion as we recede from the edge of the sector bounded by the mirrors, and is least in the remotest sector. The line of equal illumination in each individual sector, or the isophotol line, as Dr Brewster has termed it, is parallel to that radius of the sector which is nearest to the mirror on that side. It follows as a consequence, that the light will diminish in each sector in proportion as we recede from the angular point, or common centre of the field. This last circumstance limits us to the magnitude which it would be proper to allow to the field.\nof view, and therefore restricts us, in the breadth of the mirrors, when they are of a given length. In general, their breadth should not exceed one-sixth of their length, and the angle subtended by the circular field will then be about $19^\\circ$. The proper proportion, however, varies according to the angle at which the mirrors are inclined. The larger this angle, the greater latitude may be allowed in extending the field of view; while, if the angle be small, the number of reflections for completing the remote parts of the spectrum will be great; the light will become too faint to allow the eye to distinguish the parts at the circumference; and the diameter of the field must be contracted by lessening the breadth of the mirrors.\n\nWhat has now been said relates only to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> length and breadth of the mirrors. With regard to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> size, we must be guided in our choice by other circumstances of convenience. As the length of the instrument determines the distance of the eye from the field, it should be such as to admit of the distinct vision of every part of the spectrum. This may be effected, if requisite, by interposing a convex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> of the proper focal distance, between the eye and the narrow end of the mirrors.\n\nThe last circumstance we shall notice as essential to the perfect operation of the instrument, is, that the objects must be situated as nearly as possible in the plane ABC, fig. 10, formed by the ends of the mirrors. All deviations from this position are productive of irregularity in the spectrum. If the eye, indeed, were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> mathematical point, and were it possible for it to receive the rays while placed at the very point of the angle E, the distance of the object from the mirrors would, in strictness, produce no deviation from symmetry. Let the plane MN be taken at a little distance from the ends of the mirrors, and the planes of the mirrors produced till they meet it in the lines ac and bc. It is evident that the space comprehended between these lines, is the only situation in that plane from whence rays can proceed so as to fall upon the mirrors; no object, therefore, which is not within that space, can have its image formed by reflection from the mirrors. The lines ac and bc are the projections of AC and BC, as viewed from the point E. But if the eye be raised to e, it will be apparent that a space below the former, and bounded by the lines de and fe, which will now be the projections of AC and BC, will come into view. The objects situated in this space will have no corresponding images, and their introduction into the field of view will produce confusion in every part of the spectrum. The magnitude of this additional space, measured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> cr, which is represented by the instrument, and which may be termed the aberration, is dependant upon and proportional to two separate causes, namely, the distance of the eye from the angular point, and the distance of the object from the mirrors. The deviation from regularity which it produces in the spectrum increases as the object approaches to the centre. An eye accustomed to observe and admire the symmetry of the combined images, will instantly perceive it to be violated; even when the distance of the object, Ce, is less than the twentieth part of an inch. When the object is very distant, the defect of symmetry is so enormous, that, although the object is seen by direct vision, and also in some of the sectors, it is entirely invisible in the rest. If the object, on the other hand, be placed within the reflectors, a symmetrical spectrum will, indeed, be formed; but the centre of this spectrum will not coincide with the centre of the circular field of view, and its effect in producing a symmetrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is thereby entirely destroyed. In order to ensure perfect mathematical symmetry, the objects should, strictly speaking, be limited to lines lying in the same plane, which plane must be exactly in contact with the ends of the mirrors.\n\nWe have hitherto considered the effects resulting from the combination of only two mirrors, in which case, the field of view is necessarily limited to a circle. But, on the very same principles, we may, by employing a greater number of mirrors, obtain an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of this field in all directions, and produce groups of images around several centres, which shall be repeated in perpetual succession on every side. Kaleidoscopes of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> have, on that account, been called Polycentral, and, when properly constructed, their effects are exceedingly beautiful. With respect, also, to their utility, as applicable to the arts, they very far excel the simple kaleidoscope, inasmuch as the occasions requiring an ornamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> for a flat extended surface, are of much more ordinary occurrence than those in which we are limited to a circular space. The principles upon which polycentral kaleidoscopes should be constructed, and the conditions to which they are limited, were first pointed out by the author of this article, in the *Annals of Philosophy*, Vol. XI, p. 375, soon after the common instrument became known in London.\n\nIt is evident, that, by joining together a number only four of mirrors, so as to compose the sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, we might obtain a succession of images in every possible direction. But we must recollect, that for the production of symmetrical combinations of images, we are restricted in our choice of a base for the required prism to such angles only as will divide the circle into an even number of aliquot parts. This condition confines us to a very limited range. It excludes, in the first place, all angles above $90^\\circ$; and, therefore, all polygons having more than four sides. Of four-sided polygons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a>, where all the angles are right-angles, are the only figures that can give symmetrical combinations. After these, there remain only triangles; and among all the possible varieties of triangles, we can take only such as are formed with angles of $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, or $30^\\circ$, which are the quotients of $360^\\circ$, divided by $4$, $6$, $8$, and $12$; all the other even aliquot parts of the circle being excluded by the necessary condition that the sum of those angles must be equal to $180^\\circ$. We are, therefore, limited to the three following species of triangles, represented in figures 15, 16, and 17:\n\nThe first having all its angles equal to $60^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$;\nThe second its angles respectively equal to $90^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $45^\\circ$;\nAnd the third its angle respectively equal to $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$.\n\nThe sum of these angles, in each case, being $180^\\circ$.\nLet us now inquire into the effects resulting from each of these combinations.\n\nThe comparative effects of these four species of polycentral kaleidoscopes are illustrated by figures 14, 15, 16, and 17, where A, in each case, represents the sections of the mirrors, or the base of each prism; B, the elements of each pattern; and C, the pattern itself, resulting from the series of reflected images.\n\nIt will be seen that the square polycentral kaleidoscope, fig. 14, produces a less pleasing effect than the others, because the attention being more particularly directed to the repetition of the same set of images in one direction only, the whole pattern appears composed of an alternation of longitudinal stripes. The direction of the stripes is determined by the general direction of the lines, in the elementary pattern approaching more to one of the sides of the base, than to the other side. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the spectrum produced by a rectangular is quite similar to that of a square kaleidoscope, only that it is more extended in one direction.\n\nThe first of the triangular polycentral kaleidoscopes (fig. 15), which has for the base of its prism an equilateral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, affords very regular combinations of images, disposed in three different directions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> each other at angles of 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0; thus presenting what may be called a triangular symmetry. The circumstance of each pair of images being combined in groups of three together in every part of the spectrum, has suggested the name of Triascope for this species of triangular polycentral kaleidoscope.\n\nThe second species of triangle (fig. 16), which may be made the base of the prism, is that composed of two contiguous sides, together with the connecting diagonal of a square; or, in other words, of a right-angled isosceles triangle. The result of this construction is to produce a division of the field of view into regular square compartments, having the base of the above mentioned triangle for their sides. The very perfect symmetry which results from this construction is the source of remarkably beautiful designs; the predominant character of which is an arrangement of forms grouped together by fours at a time, and symmetrically disposed in squares. Such an instrument may, on this account, be called a Tetrascope.\n\nThe last species of triangular polycentral kaleidoscope, or that which takes for its base the half of an equilateral triangle (fig. 17), resulting from its division by a perpendicular drawn from an angle to the opposite side, affords also appearances of very considerable beauty. Here the predominant form is the hexagon, from the circumstance that the smallest of the angles, which is that of 30\u00b0, producing the greatest number of repetitions of the same image around one centre, the symmetry is most conspicuous with reference to that centre, and the attention of the spectator is immediately directed to the hexagonal compartments into which the field is thereby divided. As the pairs of images in these leading objects (such as the stars in the figure, which, it will be observed, have each six rays) are six in number, we shall, following the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of the other names, denominate this variety of the instrument a Hexascope. These names, derived from the circumstance which gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> character of symmetry to the extended spectrum, will perhaps be considered as sufficiently appropriate. They will, at all events, recommend themselves by their brevity, when we consider the very compound epithets which would otherwise be required in order to designate correctly the equiangular, triangular, polycentral kaleidoscope; the rectangular, isosceles, triangular, polycentral kaleidoscope; and the semi, equilateral, triangular, polycentral kaleidoscope.\n\nAs a plane surface of indefinite extent admits of subdivision, by regular polygons of the same kind, only in three ways, namely, by triangles, by squares, and by hexagons, so each of these modes of division is the result of a separate arrangement of three plane mirrors, namely, that of the triascope, the tetrascope, and the hexascope. Of these, the two last appear to be those more especially calculated to afford assistance to artists in the invention of ornamental patterns.\n\nIt is evident, that the principal advantage which the polycentral kaleidoscopes have over the simple ones, is the greater extension they give to the field of view. This field might, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, appear to be infinite; but in practice it soon becomes limited, from the great loss of light attendant on repeated reflections. The effects of polarisation, in further diminishing the light, is also greater in them than in the simple kaleidoscope. On both these accounts, metallic are preferable to glass mirrors for their construction. The number of reflections required, in order to obtain any extent of spectrum, being greater than in the ordinary kinds of simple kaleidoscopes, the instrument must be of greater length comparatively with the breadth of the mirrors, as in this way the course of the rays will be more oblique with respect to the mirrors, and a larger portion of light will reach the eye. A greater obliquity is also obtained, with the same proportion between the length and breadth of the mirrors, by making them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> at the end next the eye. The instrument will then, see fig. 18, have the form of a truncated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>, instead of a prism; ABC being the triangular base, to which the objects are to be applied, and abc the narrower end at which the eye is applied. It is true, that, in mathematical strictness, this construction is incorrect; for the mirrors, in that case, having necessarily a degree of inclination to the base, the spectrum will be composed of portions, not of a plane, but of a spherical surface, which does not admit of the same divisions; but the field really visible to the eye is too limited to render this inaccuracy of any consequence.\n\nAfter the detailed explanation which has been given, of the principles on which kaleidoscopes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, it will not be necessary to enter into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> account of the methods of constructing them. A few practical directions may, however, be useful for the guidance of such as wish to provide themselves with this source of innocent amusement. In order to construct the simple kaleidoscope, two slips of plate-glass, about six or eight inches long, and about an...\ninch, or an inch and a half in breadth, must be procured. The best form for these plates is that represented in fig. 10, where one end of them is only half the breadth of the other. The newest plate glass should be employed, as that which is old has frequently scratches and imperfections on its surface, which occasion a great loss of light. They should have been skilfully cut with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>, so that at least one of the edges may be perfectly smooth, and free from chips. If this be not the case, one of the edges must be made quite straight, and freed from all imperfections, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> it with very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a> upon a flat surface, such as another piece of plate-glass. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> surfaces of each of the plates are now to be covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, or with black sealing wax, so as to remove its reflective power. When this has been done, and the varnish is dry, take the plate of which the edge has been rendered perfect, and apply this edge against the surface of the other plate, as near as convenient to the edge of this latter plate, and keep the edges so applied in contact, by means of a strip of black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> or cloth glued along the back of the plates, so as to serve the purpose of a hinge, allowing of their opening and closing to a certain extent, like the leaves of a book. They are now to be adjusted to the proper angle, which may be done with the greatest accuracy, by directing the mirrors, placed as in fig. 10, to any line, or the straight edge of any object in contact with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> ends, and very obliquely situated with respect to the edge of either of the mirrors; then looking from the other end, open or shut the plates till the figure of a star appears, having 6, 7, 8, or any other number of rays which may be thought desirable, and observing that the images of the rays in the spectrum most remote from the object perfectly coalesce. The mirrors must now be fixed in their position by small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of wood or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, extending across the open ends of the plates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> in two or three places. These may at first be attached temporarily by means of sealing-wax; but they should afterwards be fastened more securely by other pieces glued to the plates in several places along the edges A, B. The clearness of the effect of the instrument is much promoted by excluding all light, except what comes from the field of view; and this is best accomplished, by laying a strip of black velvet, previous to the fixing of the pieces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, all along the upper side of the instrument, so as to line the whole of the space between the upper edges of the mirrors. All reflection of light from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> is thus effectually precluded.\n\nThe plates thus prepared are to be placed in a tube, as represented in fig. 11, so that the broad ends of the mirrors shall barely project beyond the end of the tube; while the narrow end is placed so that the angle formed by the junction of the mirrors, shall be a little below the middle of that end of the tube. The plates must then be kept in this position by pieces of cork or wood, wedged in between them and the tube; taking care, however, that they press but lightly on the mirrors, for a very slight force is capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> and altering the figure, even of very thick plates of glass. A cover, with a circular aperture in the centre, is then to be fitted to the end\n\nabc, which should, in general, be furnished with a convex lens, whose focal length is an inch or two greater than the length of the mirrors, in order to allow the eye to see every part of the spectrum with perfect distinctness. Persons who are short-sighted will of course not require this lens; but it will still be expedient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the end abc of the mirrors, with a piece of plane glass, as a security against the introduction of dust.\n\nIn constructing polycentral kaleidoscopes, where Of Polycentral Kaleidoscopes, three mirrors are employed, the third mirror occupies the place of the black velvet and connecting pieces already described. Great care should be taken to have three very perfect edges for the junctions of the plates with each other; and considerable attention should be paid to their being fixed at the exact angles required by the construction; and when once placed correctly, they are to be retained in their relative position by effectual securities. Similar remarks apply to the construction of square and rectangular polycentral kaleidoscopes.\n\nThe instrument, when so far completed, is now ready to be applied to the objects which are to form Object Case. A case for holding these objects, and for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to them a revolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, is fitted to the object end of the tube: the best construction for such a case is the following. Upon the end of the tube abcd, fig. 12, (corresponding to the end of the mirrors ABC, fig. 11), is placed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of brass mn, which moves easily upon the tube, and is kept in its place by a shoulder of brass on each side of it. A brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>, MN, is then made to slip tightly upon the moveable ring mn, so that when the cell is turned round by means of the milled end at MN, the ring mn may move freely upon the tube. The objects are to be placed in a small box, consisting of two glasses, one transparent, and the other ground, kept at the distance of one-eighth or one-tenth of an inch by a brass rim. This brass rim should consist of two pieces which screw into one another, so that the box can be opened by unscrewing it, and the objects changed at pleasure. This object box is placed at the bottom of the cell MN, as shown at OP; and the depth of the cell is such as to allow the side O to touch the end of the mirrors, when the cell is slipped upon the ring mn. The instrument when used, is to be held in one hand, with the angular point E downwards, and the cell is turned round with the other, so as to present the objects in succession before the aperture ACB, fig. 11.\n\nThe objects best fitted for producing pleasing Selection of effects, are small fragments of coloured glass, of proper Ob- sufficient size to occupy a certain portion of the inter- verval between the mirrors, but not so large as to engross the greater part, or to interfere with each others motions, as they are made to fall in succession into the field of view, by the revolution of the case which holds them. Wires of glass, both spun and twisted, and of different colours, and shades of colours, and of various shapes, both curvilinear and angular, maybe intermixed with the larger masses of coloured glass, together with one or two beads, bugles, fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>, bent metallic wires, small pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, and fragments of fine sea-weed. Looped curves like the figure S, double curves like the letter S, or the\nfigure 3, circles, ovals, spirals, triangles, or lines bent into angles, like the letter W or Z, have generally a good effect, either alone, or in combination with other objects. Care should, however, be taken not to crowd the case with too many objects at a time, as an excess in this respect produces a degree of complexity totally inconsistent with beauty. In order to obtain a greater variety in the styles of patterns produced, a number of different cases, with objects may be provided, so as to fit on occasionally, and be changed at pleasure.\n\nBy Dr Brewster's very ingenious contrivance of substituting for the case of objects above described, and which is applied in contact with the ends of the mirrors, a convex lens placed at a certain distance from them, the images of distant objects may be brought to occupy the exact place adapted for their reflection by the kaleidoscope, and may thus afford a still greater variety of symmetric combinations. This operation of the lens is illustrated by fig. 15, where the lens L forms an image of the object R at F, the space between the ends of mirrors, which image is multiplied by the reflecting powers of the instrument, and forms a symmetric spectrum, precisely in the same way as if a real object of that size had occupied its place. The lens may be fitted to the end of a separate tube, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> to that of the instrument, and capable of being drawn out upon it to the proper distance, which is known by observing when the spectrum appears perfectly symmetrical. The instrument in this form has been called the Telescopic or Compound Kaleidoscope; and is applicable to distant objects of every description, and equally so to those in motion, as to those at rest. All their movements are represented with singular effect in the spectrum. A blazing fire viewed by it, gives the appearance of beautiful fireworks, at one time rushing with great rapidity towards the centre, and at another issuing from it towards the circumference, or darting in splendid stariform corruscations over the field of vision. These varieties in the spectrum are occasioned both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the instrument round its axis, and by moving it forwards in any direction.\n\nThe compound kaleidoscope has thus a much more extended range than the simple kind; and it has this further advantage, that it admits of the symmetry of the spectrum being rendered perfectly correct, since the images may be brought exactly to the ends of the mirrors; a condition which can never be completely obtained, when the objects are confined in a glass case, as they must then always be separated from the mirrors by at least the thickness of the glass.\n\nThe focal length of the lens should always be much less than the length of the outer tube, and should in general be such as to be capable of forming an image at the end of the mirrors, when the object is four or five inches from the lens. Its diameter should be such as that, when it is at its greatest distance from the mirrors, it shall still occupy the whole of the field of view which is seen by direct vision; or, in other words, that the eye shall not see any part of its edge.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the effects of the kaleidoscope to a number of spectators at the same time, by throwing the images on a wall, after the manner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> lanthorn, or solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, might be easily accomplished, if sufficient light could be procured for the illumination of the objects. The form of an instrument for this purpose, is represented in fig. 20, where L is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>, the light from which being augmented by the reflector M, and concentrated by the very convex lens N, upon the transparent objects at the end of the kaleidoscope K, is formed into an image on the opposite wall by refraction through the lens P, the focal distance of which is somewhat shorter than the length of the tube. The brilliant light produced during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, carried on by means of a stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, is peculiarly fitted for the exhibition of these effects, as was very successfully shown by Mr William Allan, in his lectures at Guy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>, London.\n\nBy a contrivance on a similar principle, the patterns formed by the kaleidoscope may be copied, if thought necessary, by receiving them in a camera obscura. The readiest mode of tracing them, however, is by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a camera <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-LUCIDA\">lucida</a>, applied to the instrument at the end next the eye. The kaleidoscope might also be be applied to the microscope, if it were worth while to multiply these applications, for which, however, considering the infinite variety of designs which the simpler instruments afford, there appears not to be the least necessity.\n\nInstead of employing the exterior surfaces of glass as the reflectors, we may employ the interior surfaces of a prism of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> glass for that same purpose; and we may obtain in this way, as was shown by Dr Brewster, a total, instead of a partial reflection of light. This solid form of the instrument is peculiarly fitted for polycentral kaleidoscopes; but it is liable to the objection of its being extremely difficult to procure a piece of glass of sufficient size entirely free from veins, and also to obtain the perfect junction of the two reflecting planes.\n\nSimple kaleidoscopes have been variously constructed with reference to the angles of inclination lar, of the mirrors. In some instruments, called by Dr Brewster Polyangular Kaleidoscopes, this angle may be varied at pleasure, by allowing the mirrors to move on their connecting edges as on a hinge, so as to open or close at pleasure by means of a screw. Others admit of the mirrors entirely separating, so as gradually to become parallel to each other, and thus give rectilineal or annular patterns, as is seen in figures 2 and 3. But there is no occasion to dwell more particularly on these subjects, as the circumstances of their construction and effects must be sufficiently obvious from what has been already said; and there is probably more ingenuity than utility in devising these variations. We shall therefore conclude, by merely noticing a convenient mode of uniting several of these instruments, which was suggested by the author of this article, with a view to compare the effects of the simple and polycentric kaleidoscopes, applied to the very same set of objects. Fig. 20 shows a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of that instrument, in which m are the mirrors of a simple kaleidoscope in the middle of the tube t, and which might be set to any angle; the mirrors def on one side forming a tetrascope, and pqr on the other, a hexascope. The whole was enclosed in the tube t, at the eye end of which were\nthree separate apertures, in order to allow the observer to look through each in succession. The other end was fitted with a case of moveable objects, as in fig. 12; and was also provided with an additional tube for the reception of a lens instead of the case, and capable of being drawn out, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the whole into a telescopic instrument. The effect of the whole combination was very striking.\n\nSee Dr Brewster's Treatise on the Kaleidoscope, Edin. 1819, Harris's Treatise on Optics, Wood's Optics, Dr Roget on the Kaleidoscope, in the Annals of Philosophy, Vol. XI. p. 375; and the Compte rendu des Travaux de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Dijon, pour 1818, p. 108-117.","sp":453,"ep":465},{"h":"KANT","t":"a very eminent metaphysician, and the author of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which has been distinguished by the name of the Critical, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Transcendental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, was born at Koningsberg, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, on the 22d of April 1724. Of his paternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> little is known with certainty; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> represents them, as having sprung from an emigrant Scotsman, of the name of Cant; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> himself, who frequently alluded to this traditionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, is said to have been the first of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> who changed the initial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of his name to K, with a view to adapt it to the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a>.\n\nThe father of Kant, who exercised the humble profession of a saddler, or harness-maker, in the suburbs of Koningsberg, was distinguished rather for his integrity and respectability, than for his wealth. His mother appears to have been a woman of considerable talents, and of a more decided character. She was exceedingly pious, and much attached to the strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> tenets and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of Dr Schultz; a divine who, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, enjoyed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation for learning, eloquence, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>.* Kant uniformly spoke of both his parents, but especially of his mother, with feelings of the warmest affection.\u2020\n\nAlthough far from being in affluent circumstances, his parents resolved to bestow upon their son, Immanuel, every advantage that could result from a liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. Accordingly, after having been taught to read and write at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> school of the suburbs, he was sent, in the year 1732, to the Collegium Fridericianum, at the suggestion, it is believed, of Dr Schultz; who, even at that early period, had the penetration to discover the talents of the boy. At this school, he contracted an intimate friendship with Ruhnkenius, afterwards so celebrated for his philological attainments, which was maintained by occasional correspondence during the remainder of their lives, and which, in their early years, may naturally be supposed to have had a salutary influence on the studies of both. They were both indefatigable students; and they not only mutually assisted each other in their school exercises, but read together, during their leisure hours, whatever books their inclination led them to peruse, or their circumstances permitted them to purchase. It is rather a remarkable circumstance, however, that, at this early period, Kant devoted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> principally to philological studies; while his friend, Ruhnkenius, seemed to be attracted, by an apparently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tendency of disposition, to the cultivation of philosophy. In their maturer years, as is well known, these early predilections were precisely reversed.\u2021\n\nHaving completed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> education, he repaired, in the year 1740, to the university of his native town, where he applied himself, with great ardour, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the mathematical, philosophical, and theological sciences. Among the professors of Koningsberg, several of whom were men of considerable talents and attainments, he appears to have attached himself particularly to Professor Martin Knutzen, well known, at that period, as the author of several useful works, to whose instructions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> and philosophy Kant acknowledged himself to have been greatly indebted.\u00a7 To the great diligence and success with which he prosecuted his studies, at this period, his early writings bear ample testimony. The youth who, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of twenty-two, could boldly and successfully impugn the doctrines of Leibnitz and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">Wolf</a>, and skilfully wield the weapons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALECTICS\">dialectics</a> against the authority of the most eminent metaphysicians of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, must have bestowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> pains in the acquisition of scientific knowledge, and in cultivating the powers of his understanding. From the earliest period of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, too, he was left almost entirely to the resources of his own talents and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, and compelled, at every step, to struggle against the depressing influence of poverty. When scarcely arrived at manhood, he had the misfortune to lose both his parents, who had not the satisfaction of living to witness the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of their son's talents and industry. They, indeed, had never been able to afford him much pecuniary assistance; but he was fortunate in meeting with some relations of his family, who were in more affluent circumstances, and by whose liberality, combined with his own exertions and economy, he was enabled to continue the prosecution of his studies.\n\nAfter a residence of about three years at the university, he acted in the capacity of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> in several families, and lived about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de H\u00fclsen at Arnisdorf. During this period, he embraced the opportunities which his retirement afforded him, of collecting a vast store of general\n\n* He was Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a> at the University of Koningsberg, and the author of several works which were much esteemed in their day: among others, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the Elements of Metaphysical Science.\n\u2020 Kant had several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>, and an only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, several years younger than himself, who took orders, and had a living in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURLAND\">Courland</a>, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside until his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\u2021 Throughout every period of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, however, Kant retained a great fondness for classical literature. He was particularly partial to the study of the Roman writers; and, even in his old age, he delighted to have an opportunity of reciting and applying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> from the works of his favourite authors.\n\u00a7 Knutzen died in the year 1756, as extraordinary Professor of Philosophy at Koningsberg.\nknowledge in almost every department of science and literature, and of sketching the outlines of several of those philosophical treatises, which were soon afterwards published in rapid succession.\n\nIt is rather unfortunate that no record seems to have been preserved of the course of his studies during this most interesting period of his life; nor has he himself, so far as we know, left any memorials which might enable us to trace the gradual progress of his mind in the acquisition of knowledge. It is certain, however, that he both read and thought much. According to his own confession, he was not particularly well qualified to discharge the duties of a tutor; being always too deeply engaged in acquiring and digesting knowledge in his own mind, to be capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of it to others. His mind seems to have originally entertained a strong bias towards mathematical and physical researches, and he exhibited some specimens of knowledge, acuteness, and originality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> in the latter branch of science, from which much eminence might have resulted, had his views been exclusively confined to that department.\n\nIt was probably during the period of his retirement at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARNSTADT\">Arnstadt</a>, that he was led to engage in a laborious investigation of the various metaphysical theories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. With this view, he made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the living languages, especially the French and English, the latter of which he acquired without the aid of a master, in order to enable him to examine into the merits of the British philosophers, particularly Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. To the sceptical conclusions of the last mentioned writer, according to Kant's own confession, the world is indebted for the Critical Theory.\n\nHaving attained his thirtieth year, and already distinguished himself as the author of several tracts, exhibiting great originality of thought, Kant resolved to devote himself to the profession of a public teacher. With this view, he returned to the university of Koningsberg, and took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of M.A., according to the usual forms, in the year 1755. It was upon this occasion that he produced, in the form of an inaugural dissertation, his tract entitled, Principiorum primorum Cognitionis metaphysicae nova dilucidatio; the first of his works, it is believed, which contained any hints respecting his peculiar views of metaphysical science. In the same year, he published his celebrated treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> and Theory of the Heavens; or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">Constitution</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Structure of the whole Globe, according to the Newtonian System. In this treatise, by following out the principles of Newton, he was led to anticipate, in theory, some of the subsequent discoveries of the great practical astronomer, Herschel.\n\nSoon after he had taken his degree, he began to avail himself of the privilege attached to the character of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> docens, by delivering lectures publicly on Logic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, Mathematics, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a>; to which, at a subsequent period, he added the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral Philosophy</a>, Natural Theology, and Physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>. He had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> commenced the discharge of his duties as a public teacher, when the concourse of students, whom the reputation of his profound and extensive learning attracted, was so great, that his auditorium, or lecture-room, although <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and commodious, could scarcely contain the numbers who eagerly flocked to hear him. His affable manners and social talents, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, rendered him a most acceptable guest at the tables of the most respectable inhabitants of Koningsberg, with several of whom he lived on habits of intimate friendship.\n\nBut notwithstanding his acknowledged talents as a philosopher, and his popularity as a lecturer on scientific subjects, it was long before Kant obtained any preferment. With a mind constantly and intensely engaged in the pursuit of knowledge, he appears to have possessed no ambition beyond that of being useful in the sphere he had chosen for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of his abilities; and he had too much simplicity of character to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to any of those arts, by which other men, more emulous of distinction, frequently endeavour to advance their worldly interests. Upon the death of Knutzen, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of April 1756, he solicited the vacant extraordinary professorship of philosophy, but without success. The ordinary professor of Logic and Metaphysics, having died in 1758, Dr Schultz, who, as we have already observed, discovered at an early period the talents of Kant, and continued to patronize him so long as he lived,\u2014exerted all his influence to obtain that situation for his protege. But Kant was again disappointed. Not discouraged, however, by the repeated failure of his attempts to attain independence, he continued to deliver his lectures, and to meditate his writings. In the month of February 1766, he accepted the unsolicited situation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> keeper of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> library, to which a small salary was attached; and at the same time he undertook the management of a private cabinet of curiosities. But these offices he resigned in 1772, on account of the interruptions to which he was exposed, in showing the books and rarities to strangers.\n\nIn the year 1770, Kant at length attained the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his ambition, on his advancement to the ordinary Professorship of Logic and Metaphysics in the University of Koningsberg; a situation, which, while it placed him far above the fear of want, afforded him, at the same time, the best opportunity of employing his talents in a manner satisfactory to himself, and advantageous to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Upon this occasion, he produced his celebrated inaugural dissertation, De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Principiis; in which he propounded some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principles of that metaphysical theory, to which he was afterwards indebted for his great reputation.\n\nFrom this period, the life of Kant affords no very remarkable incidents for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of the biographer. His time appears to have been chiefly occupied in the faithful and zealous discharge of the duties of his office; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of those philosophical works, by which he hoped to accomplish an important and beneficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> in metaphysical science; and in cultivating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of a select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of friends. At this time, too, he maintained a philosophical correspondence with several of the first literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the age, and particularly with the\ncelebrated Lambert, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, whose views of philosophy were, in some respects, coincident with his own. His letters to Lambert, indeed, are peculiarly interesting, as they contain frequent allusions to the gradual development of his metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>.\n\nIn the year 1780, he became a member of the Senatus Academicus; and, in 1787, he was admitted a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Never, perhaps, did there exist a mind so ardently and so entirely devoted to the cultivation of science, and so utterly divested of all interested motives in the pursuit of knowledge. Having once attained independence, his ambition, as to worldly objects, seems to have aspired no higher. Although he received, at different times, various invitations, with most advantageous proposals, to induce him to transfer his talents and his reputation to other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, he could never be prevailed upon to leave his native town; being perfectly satisfied with the advantages he already enjoyed, and with the sphere of usefulness which had been assigned him. For many years previous to his death, he was the senior professor of K\u00f6nigsberg; and he enjoyed that high degree of respect and veneration, which was due alike to his advanced age, his eminent talents, and conspicuous virtues. He died, by a gradual decay of nature, on the 12th of February 1804, in the eightieth year of his age. His funeral was attended by the most respectable inhabitants of K\u00f6nigsberg, and by a numerous train of his friends and disciples; and, to express the public regret for the loss of so distinguished a character, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> put on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a>. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a> there was placed a sepulchral urn, with the inscription: *Cineres mortales immortales Kantii*. A beautiful commemorative medal was also executed upon this occasion, by M. Abramson of Berlin. On one side is a striking likeness of the philosopher, with the inscription\u2014*Immanuel Kant, nat. 1724*. On the reverse, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> has attempted to express the services of Kant in assigning limits to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy, by representing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> seated, and holding an owl in her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, which she prevents from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a>, with the inscription\u2014*Altius volantem arcuit*.\n\nIn his person, Kant was rather below the middle stature, of a slender and delicate form, and with a very narrow and flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>. His bodily frame, indeed, did not seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a>; nor would he, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, have attained so great an age, had not his constitution been preserved by his regular and temperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of living. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearance, strangers found nothing prepossessing, or indicative of any uncommon talents; on the contrary, his features are represented by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who visited him at K\u00f6nigsberg, as \"a reproach to physiognomy.\" Others, however, describe his countenance as full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and expressive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>. His natural disposition was cheerful and social; and his manners polite and affable. He exhibited none of that awkwardness, or reserve, which is frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>, or increased by habits of recluse meditation, and which is often thought to be characteristic of the scholar and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of science. He loved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, and was both inquisitive himself, and fond of communicating his own knowledge and opinions upon all subjects. There was nothing, however trifling it might appear, at first sight, which did not suggest to his mind some interesting reflections; and he could talk as fluently with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> on the minutiae of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> dress, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>, or the common occurrences of the day, as he could with a philosopher on the most abstruse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of science. He was very regular in his habits. He rose early; and his mornings were generally devoted to study and professional duties; his evenings to society. As he never entered into the married state, he was not encumbered with the cares of a family. He used to say, that when he would have married, he had not fortune sufficient to maintain a wife; and when he possessed the requisite fortune, he had no inclination to marry. It has been remarked, that he was fond of society; and during the earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his life, when otherwise disengaged, he used to dine at the ordinary of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> tavern; by which means he had an opportunity of acquiring an extensive knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> character, and, at the same time, of gratifying his inquisitive disposition, by eliciting from travellers of different countries many curious and valuable observations on the manners, habits, and literature of various nations. He possessed an intimate knowledge of geography, and even of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> topography, probably in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> derived from this last mentioned source, as well as from his private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of books of travels, to which he was always extremely partial; and he frequently entered into local details with a degree of correctness, which could not fail to astonish those who learnt that he had never moved fifty miles from his native town.\n\nAt a later period of his life, when more easy in his circumstances, he generally invited a few of his friends to dinner, with whom he relaxed from his graver studies, frequently enlivening his discourse with sallies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, of which he possessed no small share, and occasional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRONY\">irony</a> and satire, of that good-natured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> which inflicts no wound on the object against whom it is directed.\n\nKant's intellectual faculties were of a high order. He had a wonderful power of reflection, which enabled him to unfold the most abstruse principles, and to pursue, in his own mind, a long train of conclusions. He possessed great quickness of observation, and clearness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>; insomuch that, in conversation, he could describe any object which he had seen, or of which he had read, with admirable precision and accuracy. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> was exceedingly retentive. He kept no library, but made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> with a bookseller to send him all new publications, which he perused, and afterwards returned; and the knowledge thus acquired he had always at his command. The most remarkable feature in the moral character of Kant, was an utter abhorrence of every species of falsehood, however innocent, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of perfect honesty and sincerity, in word and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, flowing no less from his natural disposition, than from those high principles which he had early imbibed, of the value of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and the dignity of man. In this respect he was ever consistent with\nhimself; and the whole tenor of his long life may be regarded as a practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on his writings, and an exemplification of his moral maxims.\n\nThe peculiar doctrines of the critical, or transcendental philosophy, were not the offspring of impressions accidentally received, and hastily adopted; but the fruit of long, patient, and systematic investigation. Kant, indeed, was well advanced in years, before he attempted that reform in metaphysical science which he seems to have long meditated. In several of his earlier productions, and in his Letters to Lambert, he evidently appears to have been dissatisfied with the prevailing theories; and his inaugural dissertations, as already mentioned, exhibited some of those peculiar views, which were afterwards more fully developed in his great work, the *Critik der reinen Vernunft*. This work was published in 1781. For several years, it appears to have attracted little or no attention; and the publisher, it is said, was on the point of destroying the sheets, as waste <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, when a sudden demand rapidly carried off several impressions. From that period, the Transcendental Theory began to excite an extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, and to be regarded as a new and wonderful discovery in metaphysical science; the philosophers of Germany were divided into professed partizans and determined antagonists of the doctrines of Kant; and a multitude of publications issued yearly from the press, for the purpose of confirming or refuting the new principles.\n\nIt was not long, however, before the Critical Philosophy bore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all opposition, and obtained a complete ascendancy over the theories inculcated by its adversaries. It was publicly taught in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, to the almost total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, Descartes, Locke, Leibnitz, and Wolf; it gave a fresh impulse to the spirit of metaphysical inquiry; and men of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> in the scientific world felt a conscious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> in being able to comprehend, to explain, to illustrate, to apply, or to extend its principles. It not only effected an entire revolution in German Metaphysics, but exerted a powerful influence on works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> literature of the country. It is impossible, indeed, to comprehend, or to relish, many passages in the works of the more recent poets, novelists, and fugitive writers of Germany, without some previous acquaintance with the doctrines of Kant.\n\nOwing to what has been already said upon the subject in another part of this work (*Dissertation First*, Part Second, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> Seventh), we shall avoid entering into any discussion respecting the merits of the Critical Philosophy in the present article; but we shall present our readers with a very concise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of its objects and results.\n\nMr Hume proved very satisfactorily, that our ideas of cause and effect are not derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; but he rashly concluded, as Kant observes, \"that they are the spurious offspring of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> impregnated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>.\" Kant discovered, that Hume had been led to this hasty inference, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of having taken too limited a view of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, which he had thus partially attempted to solve. He perceived that the idea of cause and effect is by no means the only one which the mind makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, yet without being derived from experience; but that the science of metaphysics is altogether founded on ideas of a similar nature. He endeavoured, therefore, to ascertain the precise number of these abstract or transcendental ideas; and having succeeded in this to his own satisfaction, he found himself in possession of the whole of those connecting acts of the mind, which constitute the very elements of the understanding itself, which are indispensable to its exercise, and without which the whole of our experience would exhibit nothing but a number of isolated facts, without order or consistency.\n\nThe three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> faculties, through the medium of which we acquire knowledge, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">Sense</a>, Understanding, and Reason. Sense is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a>, or receptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>. In the objects presented to our senses, we distinguish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> and form. The forms or conditions of sense are space and time. The former of the external; the latter of the internal sense. All our knowledge is limited by space and time; for we can perceive nothing that does not exist under these conditions.\n\nUnderstanding is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, or spontaneous faculty, and consists in the power of forming conceptions. In every conception of the understanding, also, we distinguish the matter and the form. The matter is the sensible intuition; the form is the unity, or connection, established by means of the synthetic powers of the understanding, or the categories. Kant was at great pains in endeavouring to ascertain the number of these synthetic powers, or categories; and he found them to be all comprehended under the four classes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">Quantity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">Quality</a>, Relation, and Modality. The categories themselves are twelve in number. Under the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> are comprised unity, multitude, totality; under the second, reality, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>, limitation; under the third, substance and accident, cause and effect, action and re-action; under the fourth, possibility, existence, necessity.\n\nThis synthetic power of the understanding is called, in the critical philosophy, its original use. The logical use, both of understanding and reason, is to be found in the faculty of Judgment. Logic, however, has only to do with the form of our conceptions, and not with their matter; which last inquiry belongs to transcendental philosophy, or Metaphysics.\n\nReason is the third or highest degree of mental spontaneity, and consists in the power of forming ideas. As it is the province of the understanding to form the intuitions of sense into conceptions, so it is the business of reason to form conceptions into ideas. The ideas of reason are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and unconditional, and totally independent of space or time; consequently, we can neither obtain nor extend our knowledge by means of reason alone. For these ideas are nothing more than certain representations of the unconditional,\u2014of the highest unity and totality,\u2014which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the essential constitution of our reason, which serve to render the field of experience a comprehensible whole; and which, therefore, are merely conditions of the exer-\ncise of our reason, and not real external objects, of which it is possible to acquire any knowledge by intuition.\n\nThe results of the critical theory may be stated, we conceive, in a very few words. The first principles, or conditions, of all our speculative knowledge, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> subjective forms, i.e., forms derived from the constitution of the thinking being: First, the forms of sense, or pure intuitions (space and time); and, secondly, the forms or notions of the understanding (the categories). These intellectual forms or notions, however, only acquire reality by their application to our perceptions, with reference to possible experience; and, therefore, we can have no speculative knowledge of things beyond the sphere of experience.\n\nBesides the critical investigation of pure reason, in its speculative exercise, Kant instituted a similar inquiry into the nature and laws of our practical reason, and of the faculty of Judgment; and, in the spirit of his own theory, he published the Metaphysical Elements of Natural Philosophy, of Law, and of Ethics. His Logic, Physical Geography, and some other works, were published, by his friends, from his papers, and the marginal notes to his text-books. Towards the latter end of his life, he meditated a work, which was intended to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of his whole system, and which was to have been entitled, The Transition from Metaphysics to Physics; in which he proposed to demonstrate the general application of the principles of the transcendental theory. The decline of his faculties, however, prevented the execution of this projected work.\n\nWe shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> this article with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of Kant's publications.\n\nGedanken von der wahren Sch\u00e4tzung der lebendigen Kr\u00e4fte, &c.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> occupies about one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of latitude, and probably about two of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. The French discoverers imagined it to be the projecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the supposed southern continent, since proved to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> existence. The following observations on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions were made by Mr Anderson, surgeon to Captain Cook:\u2014Perhaps no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> hitherto discovered, in either hemisphere, under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of latitude, affords so scanty a field for the naturalist as this barren spot. The verdure which appears when at a little distance from the shore, would flatter one with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of meeting with some herbage, but in this we were much deceived; for this verdant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is produced only by one small plant, not much unlike some sorts of saxifrage, which grows in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> spreading tufts, to a considerable way up the hills. It grows on a kind of rotten turf, which dried, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, might serve for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, and is the only thing we met with here that could possibly be applied to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. There is another plant growing plentifully about the boggy declivities, to near the height of two feet, and not much unlike a small cabbage, when it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> into seed. Two other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> were found near the brooks and boggy places, which were eaten as salad; the one resembling garden cresses, and very fiery; the other very mild; this last, though but small, is in itself a curiosity, having not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, but what the botanists call androgynous plants. A coarse grass grows in some spots, about the sides of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KERRY\">Kerry</a>'s the harbour, and a smaller sort, which is rarer. In short, the whole catalogue of plants does not exceed sixteen or eighteen, including some sorts of moss, and a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of lichen, which grows upon the rocks higher up than the rest of the vegetable productions; nor is there even the least appearance of a shrub in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The animals found here are all of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> kind, and use the land only as a resting place, and for breeding; the most considerable are seals; no other quadruped, either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or land kind, was seen; but a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of birds, viz. ducks, petrels, albatrosses, shags, gulls, and sea-swallows. The hills are of a moderate height, yet many of their tops were covered with snow when the island was visited by Captain Cook, though it was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> answering to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">Rain</a> must be almost constant here, not only from the marks of the torrents, but from the disposition of the country; which, even on the hills, is an entire bog. The foundations of the hills are composed chiefly of a dark blue, and very hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, intermixed with small particles of glimmer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>. Another brownish brittle stone forms here some considerable rocks; and one which is blacker, and found in detached pieces, incloses bits of coarse quartz. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, a dull <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and a purplish sandstone, are also found in small pieces; and pretty large lumps of semi-transparent quartz, disposed irregularly in polyedral pyramidal crystals of long shining fibres. Some small pieces of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sort are met with in the brooks, made round by attrition, but none hard enough to resist a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILE\">file</a>; nor were any of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> acted on by aquafortis, or attracted by the magnet.

From east to west, its general length is about seventeen Irish miles, its greatest breadth, from north to south, thirty-one, and it contains, within an outline of one hundred and thirty miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> hundred and fourteen English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> about 457,000 English acres. Almost the half of this consists of bogs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and waste, and the remainder is arable, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, and pasture of a medium <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. It is divided into eleven baronies, and fifty-two parishes, the latter belonging to the sees of Kildare, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILLALOE\">Killaloe</a>, Meath, Clonfert, and Ossory.\n\nThe form of this county is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>. Its breadth on the western side is suddenly contracted by Queen's County on the south-east, and further to the east, by Kildare and Meath. A small district of it is entirely surrounded by Kildare. The interior is, with few exceptions, a dead flat, though considerably elevated. The only mountains are those of Sliabh Bloom on the boundary with Queen's County, a range which extends for about fifteen Irish miles, and has but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">Gap</a> of Glandine, which is steep, craggy, and very narrow. The Bog of Allen occupies a considerable tract on the north-east.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, either moorish or gravelly, the former tolerably productive in dry, and the latter in moist seasons, but neither of them naturally fertile. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a>, and limestone gravel, the means of their improvement, abound every where. The pastures, though in many parts fine, are not luxuriant; better adapted for sheep than cattle, and very favourable to the growth of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. Much of the mountain district has an argillaceous soil, thickly interspersed with rocks of sandstone, and a deep irreclaimable bog often occurs at its base; but towards the centre of this range, where limestone prevails, there is much good pasture, and here the base of the hills, which is composed of a stiff clay, produces abundant crops of corn. The only streams worth notice, besides the Shannon, on the western boundary, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>, which for a small distance separates this from Queen's County, are the two rivulets, Brosna, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the former. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOYNE\">Boyne</a> also touches this district on the north-east. There is only one small lake, Lough Pallis: another, Lough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNAGH\">Annagh</a>, is partly in Queen's County. The canal from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> to the Shannon passes through the county from east to west, along its whole length. The minerals and fossils, hitherto discovered, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> ores in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, manganese, ochre, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, chalk, and potter's clay, with sandstone, limestone, and limestone gravel, already mentioned. Mineral waters occur in several places.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s County is divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> estates, and many of their owners do not reside; but much of the land is held on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>, in perpetuity, and the\nholders of these form a respectable class. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> proprietors are Lords Digby, Ross, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARLEVILLE\">Charleville</a>. Farms were formerly very large, not unfrequently of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of 2000 acres, but their size has been diminished, and such as are considered large do not now exceed, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, 400 English acres. Many are as small as twenty acres, though the medium size of the smaller class may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> this. Most of the arable land is tolerably inclosed, chiefly with hedges of whitethorn, which grows here to a great size. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">Partnership</a> leases and subtenancy are less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> than in some other parts of Ireland. Yet the condition of the tenantry and the peasantry does not seem to be materially more improved. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> buildings of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> are generally very bad, the cottages in particular; and yet those who have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> accustomed to these miserable cabins, are said to prefer them to more comfortable dwellings, which, after having been erected by some of the proprietors, were for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> allowed to stand unoccupied. In other respects, also, there is little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to remark between the condition of the lower classes in this and the Irish counties before described. The English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is pretty general; the peasants speak both that and the Irish with almost equal facility.\n\nWheat, oats, barley, and potatoes, are the most common crops. Reducing the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> and corn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to English, the average produce of wheat is stated in the Agricultural Report to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than sixteen bushels; of barley and oats, it is about thirty-two bushels; and of potatoes, only four tons per acre. Both oxen and horses are employed in labour; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> is sometimes drawn by only two of either, in a few instances by two heifers. Yet this and their other implements are not generally of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>. The thrashing machine has been in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in this district for about twenty years. Limestone gravel is much used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, with the best effects, both on tillage and grass lands.\n\nThe leases were formerly for thirty-one years or three lives, but the more common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of late is twenty-one years, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the tenant in possession at the end of it is frequently added. Some tenants hold for lives renewable for ever, paying a renewal fine equal to half a year's rent or more on the fall of every life. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> leases often contain a prohibition against alienating. Nothing is so much complained of among the tenantry as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> are collected. \"I really apprehend,\" says Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Coote, the author of the Agricultural Report for the county, \"it would be a very difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to mislead the lower orders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> folk, was there a reasonable modification of tithe; and they seem one and all discontented, not so much with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, as the severe mode of collecting the tax, which is here unusually oppressive.\" The incumbent, Sir Charles thinks, is not to blame; but he lets the tithe to a proctor, and the proctor relets, or transfers his lease to another, and so on, till the person who at last collects the tithe, and necessarily pays a heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>-rent, has every inducement to exact it with the utmost rigour.\n\nThere is no manufacture carried on here to any considerable extent. That of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> is the most general, yet not upon a large scale. There are breweries and distilleries at which the greater part of the oats and barley grown in the county are consumed, little of either being used in the food of the lower classes. Course woollens are made for their own clothing, as in other parts of Ireland.\n\nThe market and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are Banagher, Philips-Town, the county town, Ballilboy, Birr or Parsons-town, Tullamore, Edenderry, Shinrone, and Clara. Philipstown and Banagher returned two members each to the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, but none of the towns are represented in the Parliament of the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">Kingdom</a>. The only members are two for the county. According to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a>, the Catholics are to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> as eight to one. In 1801, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> was estimated at 76,000; it is said to be now about 130,000.\n\nSee Sir Charles Coote's Agricultural Survey, 1801; and the Works of Young, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>, Newenham, Wakefield, and the Statistical Account of Ireland, formerly referred to under the Irish counties.","sp":478,"ep":479},{"h":"KINROSS-SHIRE","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> in Scotland, bounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east, east, and south, by the county of Fife; and on the north and west by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERTHSHIRE\">Perthshire</a>, is about twelve miles in length from east to west, and ten miles in breadth from south to north; but, according to the latest survey, contains only 78 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 49,920 English acres, being one of the smallest counties in Scotland. Kinross, the county town, situated nearly in the centre, is in north latitude 50\u00b0 15', and west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> 3\u00b0 10'.\n\nKinross-shire is the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> ground in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, formed by the Forth and the Tay, which was formerly called Ross, or the promontory, and included the counties of Fife, Kinross, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CLACKMANNAN\">Clackmannan</a>. From this county the waters flow in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is in general dry, inclining to gravel, with considerable fields of moss, and some clay and loam. The productive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> may extend to 30,000 acres, or about three-fifths of the whole. It contains several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, of which Lochleven, in the vicinity of Kinross, is the most considerable. This lake, which is about fifteen miles in circumference, and covers an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of 3308 acres, contains several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, which abound in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>, eels, pikes, perchs, and flounders. The castle of Lochleven, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> was confined, stands on one of these islands, about two acres in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. Several rivulets flow into this lake, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are the Gairny, the South Queich, and the North Queich; and the River Leven, the only stream of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> in the district, issues from its eastern extremity, and, after passing through a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the county of Fife, enters the Frith of Forth at the town of Leven. The prevailing rocks are whinstone, sandstone, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>. Coal has been found on the estate of Blair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>; it is wrought at Kelty, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Cleish, on the southern boundary of the county.\n\nKinross-shire is divided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small estates. Only about ten proprietors hold of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>; the others hold of these freeholders, the lands having been let out to them, for the most part,\nabout the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century, for payment of a feu-duty. Hence, over the greater part of the county, every single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> is a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, possessed for the most part by its owner. The valued rent is \u00a320,250, 4s. 3d. Scots; and the real rent, according to the Agricultural Survey, published in 1814, is \u00a314,541, 10s. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. In 1811, the number of freeholders was only fifteen. When the land is let out to tenants, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> are from fourteen to twenty-one years, except in the neighbourhood of the villages, where they are for a shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; and the rent is paid partly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and partly in grain, or according to the price of grain. The size of the farms is from 100 to 300 acres. A great proportion of them is always in grass, for which both the soil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> are favourable; and much of the land is inclosed either with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-walls or hedges. The principal corn crops are oats and barley, or big; wheat, though partially cultivated, does not enter into the regular course of cropping. Potatoes, turnips, and clovers, with rye-grass, are raised in every part of the county. On the banks of the Gairny and the Leven, there are meadows of considerable extent, which yield abundant crops of hay. The pastures of the cultivated land are occupied by cattle; sheep are kept in numbers only on the Cleish hills, and on that part of the Ochills which belong to this county.

At both these places several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a> are held in the year, but there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> weekly market. Nothing that deserves the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> is to be found here, except that a few weavers are employed by the manufacturers of Glasgow. Assessments are resorted to for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> of the villages; but those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> parishes are relieved by voluntary contributions.\n\nKinross-shire sends a member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> alternately with the county of Clackmannan. Both counties are under the jurisdiction of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, who has a substitute for each. There are only four entire parishes, viz. Cleish, Orwell, Kinross, and Portmoak, with portions of other three; the first three belong to the Presbytery of Dunfermline, and the fourth to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KIRKCALDY\">Kirkcaldy</a>, both under the jurisdiction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of Fife.

This instrument is intended to be used by the geologist for measuring the inclination of stratified rocks, and the azimuth in which that inclination lies.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a plummet-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> be applied to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> in that position in which the edge or bore of the plummet-level is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, and if the edge of the plummet-level be then turned round ninety degrees in the inclined plane, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> formed by the plumb-line with the line which is perpendicular to the edge of the plummet-level, is equal to the inclination of the inclined line to the horizon. On the same principle the inclination of a plane to the horizon is measured by the Klinometer.\n\nIn the Klinometer, represented at Plate XCIV. Fig. 1, AC is a circular plate, the circumference of which is divided into 360 degrees; it has three short feet on its under surface, one of which is seen at S.\n\nThe feet on the under side of the plate are of wood, which is preferred to metal, as less liable to slip when placed on an inclined surface. The ends of the feet are in a plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the upper surface of the circular plate. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of the wood is set perpendicular to the plate, to diminish the derangement which may happen by the expansion of the wood from moisture.\n\nThe arm CG is moveable round the centre of the circular plate. D is an oval hole through which is moveable the catch of a sliding bolt; this bolt passes on the under side of the circular plate; the catch of the bolt is made flush with the surface of the circular plate. The bolt serves to fix the axis C on the circular plate: when the instrument is to be used, C is the axis round which the arm CG turns. When the three short feet of the circular plate are placed on the inclined surface of a stratified rock, the arm which bears the spirit level EE is moved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the lowest point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> DD, and the arm CG is moved round till the bubble stands in the middle of the level; the arm CG and the level are then in the intersection of the inclined stratum with a plane parallel to the horizon: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> on the\nKlinometer edge of the circular plate at which the arm CG now stands is noted, and the arm CG is to be moved round through 90 degrees of the circular plate upwards; when the arm CG is arrived at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> position, it is in the line of the greatest inclination of the stratified rock. The arm which bears the spirit level EE is then to be raised, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it on the centre of the quadrant, and when the bubble stands in the middle of the level, the arm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> indicate, on the limb of the quadrant, the degree of inclination of the stratified rock. The magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> in the box OO will, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, show the magnetic azimuth, formed by the vertical plane, which contains the angle of greatest inclination; and this magnetic azimuth is to be converted into true azimuth by applying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of degrees that the needle varies from the true meridian, at the particular time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the observation is made. The box OO has both the top and bottom made of glass, so that the needle may be observed both when the instrument is placed on the upper surface, and when the instrument is applied to the under surface of an inclined plane. When the instrument is not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, the arm CG, with the quadrant and compass, are unfixed, and taken off from the circular plate, by withdrawing the catch of the bolt which is seen at d. The compass box OO is turned round an axis, which is seen below the spirit level EE, so that the compass-box comes into plane with the quadrant, and then the quadrant, compass-box, and arm, CG, pack into a flat box. The circular plate ACS is now separate from the other parts of the instrument, and lies flat in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the box made for packing the instrument.

Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> employments are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and the chace; and, like all mountaineers who are of roving habits, and inured to fatigue, they are of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> muscular make, but not tall. They have the peculiar features of all the natives of Eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, namely, the flat nose, small eye, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> union seems to be extremely imperfect, being divided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of distinct tribes, totally independent of each other, though they all acknowledge the authority of three different Rajahs. The power of these rulers, however, is very limited, excepting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> with which they live, where it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>.

Each tribe is under the command of its own chief, who is absolute both in war and peace, and has the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. This office is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a>; though, in general, the chieftain is succeeded by his nearest relation.\n\nThe Kookies are armed with bows and arrows, spears, clubs, and daces, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>, which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, is a most destructive weapon. They have shields of cow-hide, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> various devices, in order to render themselves hideous to their enemies. Their villages are built on the steepest and most inaccessible hills, by way of precaution against any sudden attack. As a farther security, they are surrounded with a thick bamboo palisade, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> leading into them strictly guarded both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and night, more especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there is any suspicion of danger. But, in all cases, they are extremely unwilling to admit strangers within the limits of the fortification. Every village belongs to a tribe, which consists seldom of less than 400 or 500 inhabitants, and sometimes of 1000 or 2000.\n\nThis barbarous race is involved in perpetual hostility, not only from the quarrels of their Rajahs, but from the depredations committed on each other by the different villages, and their constant refusal to give up the guilty persons. In these cases a petty and destructive warfare ensues, which is carried on with all the secret stratagems and barbarous devices of savages. Their favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> is to approach their enemies secretly and by night marches; after they come within sight of their prey, they lurk in ambuscade till dawn, when they commence their attack with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOUT\">shout</a>, striking their spears against their shields, and, in all cases where they are successful, they massacre indiscriminately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, woman, and child. On some occasions where they spare the children, they adopt them into their own families; and the only slaves among them are the captives thus taken.\n\nThe Kookies are of the most vindictive disposition, and, in all cases, they require blood for blood. To such a length do they carry the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, that if a tiger should happen to kill any of them, the whole tribe sets out in pursuit of him, and they never rest until they kill this or some other tiger in retaliation. They are much occupied in the chace, and as they are restrained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>, they shoot indiscriminately all sorts of animals. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">Part</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is also directed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; but in this the women perform the chief part of the drudgery.

They had at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> acquired considerable affluence; but his father had ruined himself by his expenses and speculations; and Lagrange used frequently to observe, that he owed his own success in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to his father's misfortunes, since, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had been rich, he should never have applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> as a profession.

When he was only nineteen, he was made Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> School of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>; but not before he had exhibited, in his first publication, a specimen of the improvements which he was throughout his life to contribute to the mathematical sciences.\n\nThe friendships which he formed with his pupils, most of whom were his seniors, led to the establishment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> which afterwards received the sanction of the royal authority, and to the publication of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a>, in which Lagrange not only took the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> as a contributor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> papers, but also by materially assisting in the demonstrations of Foncenex, and promoting the researches of Cigna and Saluces. Foncenex was soon rewarded by being placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> establishment which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> was then forming; and Lagrange received in a short time a still more flattering remuneration, in the panegyrics, which were liberally bestowed on him by his great rivals Euler and Dalember: the former procured him, in 1759, the compliment of being made a foreign member of the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, having become well acquainted with his merits by an epistolary intercourse, which began as early as the year 1754, when Lagrange communicated to him his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the solution of isoperimetric problems, which Euler had the delicacy to allow him time to complete, before the publication of his own further researches on the subject.\n\nIn 1764, he obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> from the Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> for a memoir on the difficult subject of the libration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, having treated it by an original method, derived from the principle of virtual velocities, which he afterwards applied so successfully to other branches of mechanics. Soon after this time he found an agreeable relief to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOTONY\">monotony</a> and retirement of his life at Turin, in accompanying his friend the Marquis Caraccioli, who was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">Ambassador</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, as far as Paris, where he had the delight of becoming personally acquainted with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the most distinguished mathematicians of the age, who were capable of appreciating his merits, especially with Clairaut, Dalember, Condorcet, Fontaine, Nollet, and the Abb\u00e9 Marie; but indisposition prevented his going on to England, as he had intended, and he returned to Turin after a short stay in France. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> prize, on the subject of the satellites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, was awarded him in 1766; and the same tribute was again paid to his merit on three subsequent occasions. It was in this year that he was invited to Berlin, as a successor to Euler in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of Mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">Director</a> of the Academy, Euler having been induced to remove to Petersburg, by a better prospect of providing for his numerous family. The appointment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the Academy, held by Maupertuis, had been given but in part to Euler; the whole was offered to Dalember, who declined it; but both he and\nEuler united in recommending Lagrange as the fittest person for the situation. It was, however, with some difficulty that he obtained his sovereign's leave to quit Turin; and the favour was at last granted to him partly in pique, on account of the terms of the invitation, which expressed the desire of the \"greatest king in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>\" to have the greatest mathematician at his court.\n\nAt Berlin he pursued his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of study in tranquillity and without interruption, upon a competent income of about L300 a year, with the advantage of such demonstrations of the royal protection, as were still more important than income to his rank in society. The king seems to have preferred him to Euler, as more tolerant in his opinions, though by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means joining in all the innovations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and rather avoiding every discussion relating to them, as well as any great familiarity with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>. He was made, in 1772, one of the eight foreign associates of the Parisian Academy. He is said to have married more for the sake of complying with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of his friends and colleagues at Berlin, than for any desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> society; and he invited a relation of his own from Turin, who became his first wife; but she was soon after carried off by a lingering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. He was about this time very closely employed on his greatest and best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the M\u00e9canique Analytique; but it was with some difficulty that the Abb\u00e9 Marie found a bookseller at Paris, who agreed to undertake its publication, and only upon condition of engaging himself to divide the loss, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of failure in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. He also procured the valuable assistance of Mr Legendre as a corrector of the press.\n\nUpon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Frederic, in 1786, Lagrange no longer felt the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in remaining at Berlin, though he was not treated by the new court with anything like disrespect. While the ministers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, were making him offers on behalf of their respective sovereigns, Mirabeau persuaded the French ambassador at Berlin to recommend Mr de Vergennes to invite him to Paris; but it was in reality through Mr de Breteuil's interest, and at the suggestion of the Abb\u00e9 Marie, that he was ultimately induced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there, in 1787, having received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of an income equal to that which he had enjoyed at Berlin, under the name of a veteran pensioner of the Academy, with a vote in its deliberations. He was kindly received by Marie Antoinette, on account of his connexion with Germany; and, until the Revolution, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of apartments in the Louvre.\n\nIt was at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of his life, when his success had been the most gratifying, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> had become perfectly established, that he appeared to suffer under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> apathy, which was absolutely morbid. He confessed that all his enthusiasm was extinguished, and that he no longer felt the least relish for mathematical researches. He had not even the curiosity, for two years, to open the printed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his Mechanics, which he had never seen except in manuscript. It is a consolation to think, that this annihilation of his energies was only partial and temporary: he amused himself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, \"with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of religions\" and of languages, and with medical and botanical, and especially chemical studies; and the alarms and agitations of the Revolution, which soon followed, instead of overwhelming his broken spirits, seem to have roused his dormant powers, and to have revived his satisfied ambition, exciting him to new labours and new triumphs.\n\nIn 1791, his name appeared on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the foreign members of the Royal Society of London. Mr Maurice has asserted, that all the scientific bodies of Europe, except the Royal Society, received him with open arms: if the remark was intended as a censure of that society, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> that its injustice should not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> unnoticed.\n\nNotwithstanding the public embarrassments which attended the Revolution, Lagrange's pension was confirmed by the National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a>, upon the proposition of Mr Dus\u00e9jour, in the most flattering manner: and when the depreciation of the currency materially reduced its amount, he received a partial indemnification, by being appointed a member of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> for examining useful inventions, and afterwards a Director of the Mint, in conjunction with Berthollet and Mongez: but this employment he found too laborious, and resigned it six months afterwards. He was greatly interested, at this period, in the establishment of the new system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>: he was so violently bent on decimation, that he scarcely forgave Borda for having made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a metre, and he thought so little of the advantage of integral subdivisions, that he sometimes declared he should have preferred the number 11 to 12, for the very reason that it admitted no subdivision at all, and caused all lesser quantities to be expressed in units comparable to each other only. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> seems, however, to have been advanced rather as an exaggerated objection to the introduction of 12, which was suggested by some more ardent innovators, than as seriously attributing a real advantage to the employment of a prime number.\n\nWhen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">Academies</a> were suppressed, the Jacobins purified the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of weights and measures by striking out the names of many of its most distinguished members, while they retained that of Lagrange, probably because he was of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> party whatever, and had always been particularly cautious in expressing his sentiments of the events of the day. In October 1793, however, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was passed which ordered all persons, not born in France, to leave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Guyton, who was a member of the Committee of Public Safety, advised him to claim an exemption from its operation, by a requisition of that committee, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of his being employed in preparing a report on Dr Hutton's Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNNERY\">Gunnery</a>; and he actually received an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> from the committee, requiring his stay, \"in order to complete the calculations which he had undertaken respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>.\" He was attempting to reunite the experiments of Dr Hutton with a more correct theory than had before been applied to them; but he published nothing of importance on the subject. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of Bailly and Lavoisier, he had agreed to return to Berlin, and to resume his former situation.\nLagrange there; and he was on the point of obtaining a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSPORT\">passport</a>, and even a public mission from H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles. But the establishment first of the Normal School, in which he was a professor, and then of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, induced him to remain at Paris, and again directed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> into its ancient channels. In the Normal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">Schools</a> the masters were mixed with their pupils, in order that the facilities of conversation might produce a development of the subjects discussed in the most elementary manner that was possible: but the conversation was by no means supported in the form of incessant questions and answers: Lagrange's explanations were often interrupted by moments of silence, in which his inventive faculties were deeply engaged in reflection, and the whole of his powers were concentrated on a new train of ideas. It was amidst these discussions that the Theory of Analytical Functions originated: a work certainly not destitute of the marks of great mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, but which, when considered as a substitute for the method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> and its kindred doctrines, resembles very much the suggested introduction of an undecimal in preference to a duodecimal scale of notation, with which the author had before amused himself.\n\nUpon the re-establishment of the Institute, Lagrange was made one of the original members; and he was the first on the list of the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">Longitude</a>, which was then first instituted at Paris. He received about this time a compliment highly grateful both to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of fame and to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> affection, in the person of his father, then past 90, and continuing to reside at Turin. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Talleyrand, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSARY\">Commissary</a> of the Directory in Pi\u00e9mont, attended by the generals of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and several other persons of distinction, went in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> to congratulate this venerable person on the merits of his son, whom he had not seen for more than 30 years, whom they declared \"to have done honour to mankind by the brilliancy of his genius, and whom Pi\u00e9mont was proud to have produced, and France to possess as a citizen.\" The old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> lived to the age of 95, and was sincerely regretted by his son.\n\nUnder the Consular and Imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, Lagrange was made a Senator, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Officer of the Legion of Honour, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> of the Empire, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> Grand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">Cross</a> of the Order of Reunion, in addition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> marks of friendship and intimacy which Bonaparte habitually conferred on him at the meetings of the Institute, and on other occasions.\n\nHe applied with so much zeal to the republication of the first part of his Mechanics in 1811, and of his Analytical Functions in 1813, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> is supposed to have suffered from the fatigue; which, in conjunction with a predisposition, not uncommon in advanced life, may very possibly have been the immediate cause of a fit that attacked him in the beginning of the latter year. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> he was subject to frequent returns of fainting, accompanied by some fever. On the 8th of April he had a last conversation with Lac\u00e9p\u00e9de, Monge, and Chaptal, all the parties being aware that it was to be the last. He felt the approach of death, but he declared that it was in that form neither painful nor even disagreeable. He spoke with proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of the favours he had received from Bonaparte, who afterwards provided very liberally for his widow and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>. The interview lasted more than two hours, and though his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> often failed him with respect to names and dates, yet his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> was correct and energetic. He survived this effort only two days, and died on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 10th April 1813. He was buried at the Pantheon, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of St Genevi\u00e8ve, and his friends Lac\u00e9p\u00e9de and Laplace paid the last honours to his memory in a funeral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>.\n\nLagrange was habitually of delicate health, and extremely temperate in his diet and mode of life, limiting his food almost entirely to vegetables, and taking his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> very punctually in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. At the age of 56 he married the young and handsome Miss Lemonnier, who appears to have felt the splendour of his celebrity and the goodness of his heart, as affording much more than a compensation for the great inequality of their ages. He was deeply sensible of her affectionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, which he considered as the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his life, and on account of which alone he regretted its termination. He had no children, and he was perfectly contented to be without them. In the midst of the most brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> he was generally absorbed in his own reflections; and especially when there was music, in which he delighted, not so much for any exquisite pleasure that he received from it, as because, after the first three or four bars, it regularly lulled him into a train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> thought, and he heard no more of the performance, except as a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACCOMPANIMENT\">accompaniment</a> assisting the march of his most difficult investigations, which he thus pursued with comfort and convenience. He was less fond of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, from which he often returned without knowing what piece had been represented. His manner in conversation was gentle and timid: he was more in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of interrogating than of giving his opinion, and his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> was, \"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">don</a>'t know\".... He was not, however, easily induced to change his sentiments when they were once fixed, having generally adopted them upon mature consideration. As a writer, whenever any controversy occurred, he was always calm in defending himself, and respectful in speaking of his antagonists. Notwithstanding that his person was striking and characteristic as well as pleasing, he would never consent to have his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> painted, thinking it unworthy of a man of intellectual excellence to wish to be remembered for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form of his features. But a sketch of him was once obtained by stealth at a sitting of the Institute, and a mask of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> was taken after his death. His works bear witness, that for 54 years he occupied either the first or very nearly the first place among all the mathematicians of his age, and of all ages. \"Of all the inventors,\" says Laplace, \"who have the most contributed to the advancement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge, Newton and Lagrange appear to me to have possessed in the highest degree that happy tact, which enabled them to distinguish general principles among a multitude of objects enveloping them, and which is the true characteristic of scientific genius. This tact, in La-\nLagrange was united with a singular elegance in the method of explaining the foundations of the most abstract truths of analysis.\" Lagrange was a great admirer of Euler, who perhaps excelled him in the adroitness with which he employed the most refined artifices of calculation, though his views and methods were less original and less powerful. Dalem- bert was highly esteemed by Lagrange, as a man of abundant ingenuity and talent, though less accurate in his conclusions, and in his modes of reasoning, than either Euler or Newton. Newton he envied almost as much as he admired, for having found a system of the world in existence, and the principles of its modification not yet understood: but when it is remembered that the places of the heavenly bodies are now ascertained to seconds more nearly than they were to minutes during the life of Newton, it cannot be thought that Newton left too little for his successors to accomplish.\n\n1. His first publication, at the age of 18, was, A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to C. J. Fagnano, 23d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1754. It contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> for fluxions and fluents of different orders, somewhat resembling the binomial theorem of Newton.\n\n2. The series of his papers in the Miscellanies of Turin is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> from 1759 to 1785. The first is On Maxima and Minima, Misc. Taur. I. 1759, p. 18. It is founded on the principles laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by Maclaurin, and is illustrated by the case of the successive transmission of an impulse through a series of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> bodies, comprehending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of a number of variable quantities. 3. On an Equation of finite differences, and on the Theory of recurring Series, p. 33. The equation is resolved by an exponential integral, and the sum of the series is obtained by the principles of fluxions: the same mode of calculation is also applied to the laws of chance. 4. Researches on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and propagation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>. End of the volume. The investigations of Taylor and of Newton were true and correct as particular solutions only of the problems of chords and of undulations, though mistaken for general solutions, and as such successfully combated by Cramer, whose reasoning, though certainly too far extended, is here approved by Lagrange. Daniel Bernoulli very successfully defended them both, not only as particular solutions, but as capable of being rendered universal by proper modifications and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>. Euler had proposed a more general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> for the case of chords; Dalembernt insisted that this method required a limitation to figures exempt from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> and from abrupt changes of curvature, and Lagrange is inclined to admit his exceptions. But, after all, the question is merely a metaphysical refinement, since no abrupt changes can ever occur in the actual form of a chord; and a chord affording a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> of unlimited acuteness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> approach without limit to a mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>. The author begins, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>, with considering the motions of a finite number of bodies, and then proceeds to the affections of a fluid, which he reduces to the same equations as are applicable to the motions of chords, and these he integrates in Dalembernt's manner. He lastly examines the phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HARMONICS\">harmonics</a> observed by Tartini, and explains them very satisfactorily from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of the beats of discordant sounds. 5. New Researches on Sound, Misc. Taur. II. 1760-1, p. 11. The same subject is here continued, and extended to the divergence of sound, which had before been examined by Euler. The author now admits that there is no inconsistency in the demonstration of Newton and Cramer, which deduce the same velocity from different laws of the supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, since the velocity is really uniform in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. The oscillations of a heavy chain are computed, and some remarks are made in conclusion respecting the sounds of flutes. 6. On the Maxima and Minima of indefinite integrals, p. 173. This essay contains the foundation of the method of independent variations, which has excited so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> for the universality of its application and the utility of its results. It was received with distinguished applause by Euler, as fulfilling his own wishes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of a similar method; and it was Euler who more fully explained its principles, and gave it the name of the method of variations, which has since been generally applied to it. In fact, however, the foundation of the method had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before been laid by Leibnitz, under the name of differentiation from curve to curve; and he had proved that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of integration, with respect to one kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>, might be applied to the differentials or fluxions taken in another manner, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of first obtaining the fluent: and Euler had employed this consideration in treating of the geometrical properties of curves affording maxima or minima: but his method is less simple and less general than that of Lagrange, who first pointed out the universality of the principle, that the variation of the fluxion is equal to the fluxion of the variation, and showed its utility in many cases of such integrations, as leave the expression concerned still a fluxion of another kind: and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> application of the method, he made the fluxion of the ordinate of a vibrating chord represent its inclination to the axis at any given time, while its variation indicated its velocity or its change of place in successive intervals of time, and the fluxion of a revolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> to relate to the magnitude of its different parts, while its variation depended on its rotatory velocity. The steps of the method are generally simple and easily understood, at least they may and ought to be rendered so; but the merit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> is not the less, because it admits of a very ready application, and because it might have occurred to a less distinguished mathematician; as indeed something nearly resembling it seems to have been employed by Fontaine in 1734, under the name of the fluxiodifferential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, in the investigation of a tautochronous curve. 7. It was particularly in demonstrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, which is called the law of the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, that Lagrange completed the theory of variations, where Euler had felt its deficiency; and the application of the method to several Mechanical Problems constitutes the second part of the Memoir. p. 106. The author takes occasion also to correct an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of Dalembernt, who had imagined that there was no necessity that the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of a given density, in a body like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, supposed to be in a state of\nLagrange's fluidity, should all be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, which, however, is here shown to be a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of D'Alembert's own equations. 8. Addition to the memoir on Sound, p. 323; admitting the difficulty raised by D'Alembert, respecting the continuity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a chord, and acknowledging that the initial figure must not be supposed angular; while, in fact, as Mr Fourier has lately demonstrated, and as had been remarked many years ago in this country, an infinite series of harmonic curves may approach infinitely near to two right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> meeting in an angle. 9. Problems relating to the integral calculus, Misc. Taur. III. 1762-5, p. 179.\n\nA miscellaneous paper, containing remarks on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of equations, containing fluxions of different orders; on some cases of the motions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>; on the vibrations of chords; on the properties of small oscillations in general; on loaded threads; on central forces; and on the theory of Jupiter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>. 10. An arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, Misc. Taur. IV. 1766-9, p. 44. This paper, dated at Berlin, contains a complete resolution of all equations of the second degree, having whole numbers for their roots; a problem, like most of those of Fermat, of more curiosity than utility, but well calculated to exercise the powers of minds like those of Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss. The question, which is the particular subject of this paper, was proposed as a challenge by Fermat to his contemporaries in England, and correctly answered by Wallis, though without a very satisfactory demonstration. 11. Integration of an Equation, p. 98. A case in which the whole equation is integrable, though its parts, even when properly separated, are incapable of perfect integration. 12. On the method of variations, p. 163. In answer to Fontaine, and to Le Seur and Jacquier, who had attacked him in their Integral calculus. 13. On the motion of a body attracted by two fixed centres, p. 188, 216, including the effects of different supposed laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>. 14. On the figure of columns, p. 123. This memoir contains an attempt to demonstrate that the cone is a more advantageous figure for the strength of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONOID\">conoid</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> than any cone. But the calculations are founded on the erroneous supposition, that the column must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> before it breaks; and, even upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, it appears possible to assign a stronger form than a cylinder, since the summit and the base of the cylinder must certainly contain some useless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. 15. On the mean of a number of observations, p. 167; showing the advantage of taking the mean, from the theory of probabilities. 16. On the impulse of fluids, Mem. Taur. 1784-5, I. p. 75. The author observes, that this impulse will be measured by a column of twice the height due to the velocity, when the whole impulse of the jet is received by an obstacle, but of the simple height, when a limited surface is exposed to the force of a larger stream. 17. On the integration of some irrational fluxions, II. p. 218, involving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> root of an expression ascending to the fourth power of the variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. 18. Some of the later of these papers are subsequent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> to those which are found in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin; but the order of enumeration is of little consequence. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of Lagrange to the Academy, of which he was made director, is On tautochronous curves, Mem. Lagrange-Berl. 1765, p. 364. The paper is dated 1767; and it contains a completion of Fontaine's investigation of the subject. 19. On the expected transit of Venus, 1766, p. 265. The author has here analytically investigated the curves of immersion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERSION\">emersion</a> for the different parts of the earth. But, as Mr Delambre observes, in order to arrive at the very easy and tolerably accurate solution previously given by Delille and Lalande, he is obliged to employ in succession several elaborate expedients, founded on some very subtle principles, accompanied by various transformations of his ordinates, while, by a trigonometrical calculation of a few lines, we may obtain a more complete formula, comprehending even the terms which he has neglected, and which, although very small, are not absolutely insensible. At the same time, he has certainly applied his formula to the calculation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, in a very convenient manner, which had accidentally escaped both Delille and Lalande, though it follows readily from the trigonometrical calculation. 20. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> Problems of the second degree, 1767, p. 165. This is the first of a numerous series of papers, relating to this difficult branch of analysis, which, notwithstanding its practical inutility, has afforded sufficient scope for the exertion of talent, to give celebrity to the names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a> and Fermat among the most ingenious of mathematicians. 21. On numerical equations, p. 311. This subject was also much cultivated by the author at a subsequent period: he here finds an equation for the differences of the roots, and exhibits the result in the form of a continued fraction. 22. Continuation of the memoir on numerical equations, 1768, p. 111. The method of continued fractions is still further improved. 23. On the resolution of indeterminate problems in whole numbers, p. 181. 24. On the resolution of literal equations by series, p. 251. The contents of these memoirs have been principally merged in the author's later productions. 25. On the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, 1769, p. 167. It is demonstrated in this interesting paper, that the force of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> approaches to the law of a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>, the more nearly as its length is greater. 26. On Kepler's problem, p. 204. An application of the methods explained in the last volume, especially of a very elegant formula for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of series. 27. On elimination, p. 303. A refined and general method of exterminating a quantity from an equation, which, however, is somewhat intricate, even in the simplest cases. 28. Remarks on isochronous curves, 1770, p. 97. Chiefly in answer to Fontaine, who had attacked him, and who had claimed the invention of the test of integrability of an expression containing several variable quantities. Lagrange observes, that he might very possibly have rediscovered it, but that it was published by Nicolas Bernoulli in 1720; by Fontaine, not till 1758. 29. On arithmetical theorems, p. 123, relating to the decomposition of a number into squares. 30. On the resolution of equations, p. 184. 31. On a theorem respecting prime numbers, 1771, p. 125. A demonstration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of prime numbers discovered by Mr Wilson, and published by Waring; and of some other theorems of Waring. 32. On equa-\n\nVOL. V. PART II.\nIn continuation. 33. On a new mode of differentiation and integration, 1772, p. 185. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> consists in considering the characteristic of a fluxion as a quantity multiplying the letter to which it is prefixed, and inferring by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> that the result of the combinations obtained will in general remain unaltered by the supposition. The grounds of this method have been of late more fully explained by Arbogast and others. The results are here applied to interpolations, and to differences of various orders. 34. On the form of imaginary roots, p. 222.\n\nIn general reducible to $A + \\sqrt{-1}B$. 35. On astronomical refractions, p. 259; without any practical applications. 36. On equations of partial differences, p. 353; especially on finding multipliers to make them integrable. 37. On undisturbed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>, 1773, p. 85. A more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> method of investigation than that of Euler or Dalmont; but without any new results. 38. On the attraction of elliptic spheroids, p. 121. The author observes, that Maclaurin's prize essay is a masterpiece of geometry, comparable to the best works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, though Dalmont had once doubted of the accuracy of some of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>. Thomas Simpson's was the first analytical solution of the problem, but it was indirect, and depending on series only. In this paper the method of demonstration only is varied. Legendre and Laplace subsequently continued the inquiry. \"But Mr Ivory,\" says Delambre, \"has lately shown us, that a very simple consideration may in some cases supersede a multitude of calculations, and even afford us theorems to which the most prolix computations could scarcely have conducted us.\" 39. On triangular pyramids, p. 149. An analytical determination of the content, and of the figures that may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> in the pyramids, when their six sides are given. 40. Arithmetical researches, p. 265; on the integral roots of equations of the second degree. 41. On particular integrals, 1774, p. 197. Laplace had already pointed out the occasional occurrence of integrals, not included in the general and direct expression obtained by the usual modes of integration. Such values are here deduced from the variation of the quantities originally considered as constant, which often affords us an equation of a different form, and leads to values not comprehended in the regular expression of the integral. 42. On the motions of the nodes of the planetary orbits, p. 276. Euler, Lalande, and Bailly had found some expressions for the temporary change of position of the nodes; the equations are here integrated, and the total changes determined. 43. On recurring series varying in two ways, or on partial finite differences, 1775, p. 183. With an application to the theory of chances, upon Laplace's principles. 44. On spheroids, p. 273. A demonstration of Maclaurin's theorem (Fluxions, Art. 653) concerning the attraction of a compressed spheroid or an amygdaloid; derived from the formula contained in the former papers. 45. Arithmetical researches continued, p. 323. Demonstrating some theorems of Fermat with which Euler had not succeeded; yet leaving others still unattempted. 46. On the mean motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, 1776, p. 199. Showing that all their changes are periodical. Laplace had detected an error in the author's reasoning when he attributed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> equations to the motions of Jupiter and Saturn, the expressions, containing the terms in question, being compensated by others which he had neglected. 47. Cases of spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a> solved by series, p. 214. Without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> advantage. 48. On integration by continued fractions, p. 236. Gives an example of the binomial theorem converted into a continued fraction, which, however, exhibits no particular elegance nor simplicity. 49. On the number of imaginary roots of equations, 1777, p. 111. Harriot was the father of the doctrine of equations. Newton made great improvements in it, but his rule remains imperfect with regard to the higher equations, even with the additions of MacLaurin and Campbell. In the present paper the theorem of Waring is demonstrated, without any material attempt to extend it. 50. On the Diophantine analysis, p. 140. It is remarked that Fermat left all his propositions undemonstrated, except this theorem, that the sum of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIQUADRATIC\">biquadratic</a> numbers can never be a square. 51. On escapements, p. 173. An investigation of the best forms of pallets for the dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> and the receding escapements. 52. On determining the orbits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> by three observations, 1778, p. 111, 124. The first part of this memoir is historical and critical, and the author allows due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the ingenuity of Newton's method: his own does not appear to have been of any practical utility. 53. On the theory of telescopes, p. 163. Comparing the general theorems of Cotes and Euler, and applying the method of recurring series to their demonstration; with a rule for determining the magnitude of the field. 54. On the expression of the time in a conic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, p. 181. After Lambert, who determines it from the chord of the arc described, the sum of the revolving radii, and the great axis: the theorem is here analytically demonstrated. 55. On particular integrals, 1779, p. 121. Examples from some mechanical curves. 56. On geographical projections for maps, p. 161, 186. The methods here proposed for the construction of maps have been found too intricate for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>. 57. On the theory of the libration of the moon, 1780, p. 203. In the prize essay on the moon's libration, the author had made the first application of the method of variations: the investigation is here continued, and it is observed that the moon cannot be of homogeneous matter, nor its form such as would afford equilibrium to a fluid covering it, since the effects of the ellipticity, so determined, would be much less perceptible than they are. 58. Report on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> of the circle. Hist. Ac. Berl. 1781, p. 17. This paper only requires to be noticed as a specimen of the author's condescension. 59. Theory of the motion of fluids, M\u00e9m. p. 151. An application of Dalmont's principles to the phenomena of running fluids, and to the motion of waves; but founded on an arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> with respect to the depth affected by the waves. 60. On the secular variations of the elements of the planets, p. 199. The theory of perturbations is here examined by two methods, either comprehending the general form of the orbit, or regarding the local effects only. 61. Report on a\nmode of finding the form of the earth, Hist. 1732, p. 35. A proposal of no value whatever. 62. On the secular variations of the planets, M\u00e9mo. p. 169. A continuation of the former memoir, with all the details of the application, and a determination of the change of the place of the ecliptic, together with a demonstration of the permanency of the general arrangement of the system, depending on the exemption of the mean distances from all variations not periodical, while the other elements are liable to greater alterations. 63. On the periodical variations of the planetary motions, 1783, p. 161. A sequel to the memoirs on the secular variations. 64. Additions respecting the secular variations, p. 191. Completing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, and extending it to the case of Jupiter and Saturn, which had before been investigated by Laplace. 65. On the correction of the errors of astronomical approximations, p. 224. The errors here considered arise from the employment of the powers of the arcs described in the equations concerned, these arcs increasing without limit; they may be avoided by means of approximations founded on the supposition of the variation of the elements. Laplace had before employed a method still more refined. 66. On a particular mode of approximation, p. 279. Resembling that which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIGGS\">Briggs</a> employed for making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>. 67. On a new property of the centre of gravity, p. 290. Relating to the mutual distances of the bodies. 68. A direct and general determination of the motion of a comet, p. 296. In this third memoir the problem is reduced to equations of the 8th or 7th degree. 69. Theory of the periodical variations of the planetary motions, 1784, p. 187. Continuation of the memoir of the preceding year, containing the independent variations of the eccentricities and inclinations, for the six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> planets; with a numerical application of the formulae demonstrated in the first part. 70. On the integration of equations of linear partial differences, 1785, p. 174. Entering into further details of the method laid down in a former paper, which is here applied to the problem of trajectories, a problem once proposed by Leibnitz as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of strength to Newton, who was not fully aware of the nature of the difficulty intended to be combated: it was, however, solved in England by Taylor, though indirectly. Nicolas Bernoulli and Hermann gave a more complete solution, and Euler added still more to the generality of the investigation. The author observes that the problem is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> curiosity; there is, however, one case in which a trajectory of the kind here considered is actually applicable to a natural phenomenon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> occurrence, which is that of a wave diverging from a point in a gradually shelving shore; for the figure or direction of the collateral parts of such a wave may be shown to be the orthogonal trajectory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> an infinite number of cycloids beginning at the given point. 71. On the motion of the aphelia of the planets, 1786, i. A geometrical investigation, in the manner of Newton, intended as an appendix to the Principia. 72. On the theory of sound and waves. This paper is also intended to complete the demonstrations contained in the same work. The volume, in which both these interesting memoirs appear, seems to have been published out of the regular order, from some circumstances connected with the death of Frederic; and it is wanting in many of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>. 73. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> accompanying a memoir of Duval le Roi, 1786-7, p. 253. On the secular equations of the Georgian planet. 74. On a question relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>, 1792-3, p. 235. The case of an annuity supposed to commence after a death, and to cease at a given age. 75. Additions to former memoirs, p. 247. On recurring series (n. 43); on elliptic spheroids (n. 38); on interpolations, in Mouton's manner, comprehending the inequality of the distances of the observations; on the secular equation of the moon (n. 64). After Laplace's great discovery of the cause of the secular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, Lagrange found that it might have been easily deduced from his own calculations, almost in the same form, if he had not accidentally neglected the application, from having assured himself, in 1783, that the results of a similar computation were nearly insensible in the case of Jupiter and Saturn. It was in 1787 that the discovery of Laplace was announced. The acceleration here computed is $10^{-5}$ for the first century after 1800. Mayer found it $9^{-5}$ from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of observations. 76. On a general law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, 1803, Math. p. 3. A demonstration of the foundation of the method long used by English opticians for determining the magnifying powers of telescopes of all kinds, which form an image of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>-glass beyond the eyeglass, by measuring the diameter of that image. The author hazards, in this paper, the very singular assertion, that the illumination of the object must be the same in all telescopes whatever, notwithstanding the common opinion, that it depends on the magnitude of the object-glass; and his reasoning would be correct, if the pupil of the eye were always less than the image of the object-glass in question; since, as he observes, the density of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> in this image is always inversely as the magnifying power: but he forgets to consider that the illumination on the retina, when the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> is taken in, is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> ratio of the density and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; a consideration which justifies the common opinion on this subject, and shows that a most profound mathematician may be grievously mistaken in his conclusions, if he proceeds to calculate upon erroneous grounds. It deserves, however, to be remembered, that the brightness of any given angular portion of a magnified image must always be somewhat less than that of an equal portion of the object seen by the naked eye: because it can be no greater if the pencil fills the pupil, and will be less in proportion as the pencil is smaller than the pupil, besides the unavoidable loss of light at the refracting surfaces.\n\n77. The later works of Lagrange have principally been published at Paris, and most of them in the various Collections of the Academy. The earliest of these are the prize memoirs, and first the essay On the libration of the moon, which obtained the prize in 1764. Ac. Par. Prix. IX. 1772. It is in this memoir that the method of variations was first practically applied to a mechanical problem. 78. On the inequalities of the satellites of Jupiter, in 1776. Including the consideration of their mutual perturbations, and consequently a case of the problem of\nLagrange six bodies. The author never resumed the subject, but its investigation was completed by Laplace.\n\n79. A new method of solving the problem of three bodies, in 1772. 80. On the secular equation of the moon, in 1774. M. Sav. Etr. VII., for 1773. An unsuccessful attempt, with conjectures respecting the existence of a resisting medium, and even doubts of the accuracy of the foundation of Halley's discovery.\n\n81. A prize memoir, On the perturbation of comets passing near planets. M. Sav. Etr. X. Par. 1785, p. 65. Finding the path directly, without regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">conic sections</a>, and employing three different modes of computation for the different parts of the orbit. 82. On forming tables by observations only, M\u00e9m. Ac. Par. 1772, i. p. 513. The method of recurring series is principally employed, and the author observes that the problem is more useful than difficult, giving an experimental example in the equation of time, for which he obtains from the results of the tables an expression very near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Delambre remarks that this is only a continuance of the system adopted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> and the other ancient astronomers, showing what we might have done in a circuitous manner by pure mathematics, if Newton and the laws of gravity had not existed; and he thinks the paper only valuable as a specimen of Lagrange's talent for overcoming difficulties, which he might more easily have avoided.\n\n83. On the nodes and inclinations of the planetary orbits, 1774, p. 97. With details of the calculations for all the planets. 84. On the variation of the elements of the planets. M\u00e9m. Math. Inst. 1808, p. 1. The object of this paper is to show, as Poisson had done before, that all the changes of the system are periodical. The method is more general, but less simple than that of Laplace, who first discovered the principle by induction. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> acceleration is given as an example. Mr Poisson has extended his calculations to quantities of the second order, which do not enter into Lagrange's investigations.\n\n85. On the variation of independent quantities in general in mechanical problems, p. 257. The author observes that many of the modern improvements of mathematics depend on the doing away the distinction between constant and variable quantities, which was so valuable when it was first enforced by Descartes.\n\n86. A second memoir on the variation of independent quantities, 1809, p. 343. Simplifying the general application of the doctrine.\n\n87. Lectures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a>. S\u00e9ances des Ecoles Normales, year III. 1794-5. The first lecture relates to the elements of arithmetic, the second to the lower orders of equations, and the third to the higher. All these lectures, under the name of conversations, were taken down in short-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> by some of the students, and afterwards corrected by the professors.\n\n88. An essay on political arithmetic. Roederer, Collection de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> Ouvrages, Paris, an IV. 1795-6.\n\n89. In the Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique, we find an Essay on numerical analysis, and on the transformation of fractions, Vol. II. 1798, p. 95. It contains the elementary theory of continued fractions, and the mode of reducing them.\n\n90. On the principle of virtual velocities, p. 115. Chiefly relating to pulleys.\n\n91. On the object of the theory of analytical functions, VI. 1800, p. 232. A detailed explanation of the grounds of the theory laid down in the separate publication on this subject.\n\n92. Analysis of spherical triangles, p. 270. Giving all their essential properties in a concise form.\n\n93. Lectures on the calculus of functions, XII. 1804. Published also separately in 8vo. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on the theory of functions, and a supplement to it, contained in twenty lectures.\n\n94. Two more lectures, XIV. 1808; at the end, chiefly relating to the method of variations.\n\n95. On a difficulty respecting the attraction of spheroids, VIII. xv. Remarks which may serve as a commentary on a passage of the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste.\n\n96. On the origin of comets. Connaissance des Temps, 1814.\n\n97. On the calculation of eclipses, as affected by parallax, 1817. From the Berlin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a> for 1782. This memoir, as Delambre observes, is singularly attractive to a person previously unacquainted with the methods which are employed; but though the formulae first introduced are direct and rigorously accurate, the whole investigation ends in an approximation which wants both these properties.\n\n98. The most important of all the works of Lagrange are those which have appeared in separate volumes; and among these we may reckon his Additions \u00e0 l'Alg\u00e8bre d'Euler, S. Lyons, 1774, Vol. II. German, 1796. English, 1797. They relate chiefly to continued fractions, and to indeterminate problems, and constitute the most valuable part of the whole work, which, in its abridged form at least, is far inferior to Maclaurin's Algebra.\n\n99. M\u00e9canique analytique, 4. Par. 1788, 2d edit. Vol. I. 1811, Vol. II. by Prony, Lacroix, and Binet, 1815. This work exhibits a uniform and elegant system of mechanical problems, deduced from the simple principle of virtual velocities, which was well known to former authors, but never so extensively applied. It has been remarked, that many parts of it may be read with advantage, even by those who are not competent to enter into any of the computations; exhibiting such a history of the progress of the science, as could only have been sketched by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. The new edition, begun at the age of 75, comprehends all the improvements contained in the author's later memoirs on various subjects.\n\n100. Th\u00e9orie des fonctions analytiques, 4. Par. 1797, 1813. The abstract theory of analytical functions has been very fashionable among modern mathematicians; but the improvements which it contains are chiefly of a metaphysical nature, if they can with propriety be called improvements. The notation is less simple than that which is in common use, and has been abandoned by the author in some republications of the works in which he had at first employed it. The calculations, too, are often more intricate than others which afford the same conclusions.\n\n101. R\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations numeriques, 4. Par. 1798, 1808. The refined and abstruse calculations, contained in this volume, are more calculated to promote the advancement of the abstract science of quantity, than to be applied, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> would seem to denote, to the purposes of numerical computation. The methods investigated are in general laborious and complicated, though instructive.\nLagrange and capable of extensive application; and for equations, of which all the roots are real, the author himself recommends Mr Budan's method, as preferable to his own. The second edition contains a number of very interesting notes, which are full of ingenuity and novelty.\n\nThe author of so immense a series of laborious investigations must certainly have been a most extraordinary man. He had acquired the character of an illustrious mathematician almost in his boyish years; and he continued to apply the force of his powerful mind, for more than half a century, to the almost uninterrupted pursuit of his favourite sciences. It seems, however, that his earliest were also his greatest successes; and all that followed was as little as could well be expected, from a continued employment of the means which he possessed at the beginning; for, in fact, the whole taken together appears to bear a stronger character of great industry, than of great sagacity or talent.\n\n\"It was formerly usual,\" says Delambre, \"for mathematicians to inquire, in every investigation, for some general considerations, which might be capable of simplifying it, or of reducing it to a problem already resolved, and to endeavour by these means either to abridge the calculation, or sometimes to supersede it altogether. But since the discovery of the infinitesimal calculus, the facility and universality of this method, which often renders the possession of any talent in the calculator wholly unnecessary, has made it more usual for mathematicians to direct their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> attention to the perfection of this all powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. But at the present day, when researches of this kind appear to be completely exhausted by the labours of Euler, Lagrange, and their industrious contemporaries, it might perhaps be more advisable to return to the ancient method, and to follow the example of Newton, surely, and of Daniel Bernoulli, who, as Condorcet observes, was entitled to the praise of moderation in the introduction of his calculations. Lagrange was in the habit of employing his sublime talents in a different manner: he liked to make everything dependent on his analysis, though, in some instances, he united both methods in the highest degree, as his invention of the calculus of variations bears witness. His reducing the theory of sound to that of the vibration of chords, is a specimen of a very ingenious simplification; as well as his mode of computing the planetary motions by the variation of the elements of their orbits, which is also applicable to all other cases of the operation of small disturbing forces. But it must be confessed, on the other hand, that he has sometimes created difficulties where none existed, by applying his profound and ingenious methods to the solution of elementary problems, which may be obtained from a construction of the simplest kind; and the powerful agents which he employs, on many trifling occasions, remind us only of the man in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, who came to borrow the club of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> of Jupiter, for the purpose of destroying a flea;\" or of the modern mathematician, who, without any fable, or any figure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, proposed to adjust a standard measure, by placing it at a distance, and viewing it with a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>. The habit of relying too confidently on calculation, and too little on common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, will perhaps account for the mistakes of Lagrange, which have been already noticed, respecting the forms of columns, and the illumination of optical instruments: nor are they the only instances of the kind which may be produced from the modern history of the sciences. It seems, indeed, as if mathematical learning were the euthanasia of physical talent; and, unless Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> can succeed in stemming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, and in checking the useless accumulation of weighty materials, the fabric of science will sink in a few ages under its own insupportable bulk. A splendid example has already been displayed by the author of the article Attraction in this Supplement; and to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to our neighbours, it must be allowed, that they have received the boon with due gratitude, and acknowledged it by merited applause: \"All the analytical difficulties of the problem,\" say Legendre and Delambre (M. Inst. 1812), \"vanish at once before this method; and a theory, which before required the most abstruse analysis, may now be explained, in its whole extent, by considerations perfectly elementary.\" It is indeed only when a subject is so simplified, that the investigation can be considered as complete, since we are never so sure that we understand the process of nature, as when we can trace at once in our minds all the steps by which that process is conducted. It is not without some reason that a similar disposition, to revel in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of mathematical sports, has been sometimes objected to Laplace, a man of equal analytical acquirements with Lagrange, but possessed apparently of greater sagacity, and certainly more successful in his application of mathematics to physical researches, although he, also, seems, on some occasions, to have suffered his habits of abstract reasoning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> away his attention from the true conditions of the problem; particularly in his first supplement respecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> attraction, which concludes with an equation so erroneous, that he has been obliged to abandon it in silence. (See the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">Cohesion</a>.) Another instance of ill applied computation has been noticed in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHROMATICS\">Chromatics</a>; when Laplace attempted to deduce the laws of extraordinary refraction from the principle of the minimum of action, he seems to have forgotten that the demonstration of that principle, in his own great work, rests expressly on a condition which is here wanting, that \"the forces concerned must be functions of the distances,\" and of course independent of the directions. These imperfections, however, would not deserve to be noticed as materially affecting the general merits either of Lagrange or of Laplace, but they may be considered as accidents, which ought to warn us, against relying too implicitly on authority, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, when it appears to militate against clear simple reasoning, and sound common sense.\n\nDelambre, M\u00e9mo.

His earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, like that of most other children, seems to have been for romantic tales, and he was fond of making little stories with the materials that he possessed, but their subjects were chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>. He was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of living much with the Jesuits, and he imbibed from them a predilection for the pulpit; at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of ten he used to amuse himself with making sermons, and preaching them to a select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>. The comet of 1744, however, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> tail, took more forcible possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and he watched it with the most unremitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. Having been sent to Lyons, to continue his studies under the Jesuits there, he acquired a taste for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> and eloquence, and was then inclined to devote himself to literature and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>; but an eclipse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> recalled his attention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>. His parents wished him to follow the profession of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, and sent him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> with that view; but he accidentally lodged in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOTEL\">hotel</a> where Delisle had established an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, and this circumstance led him to become acquainted with that professor, and to attend his lectures. These lectures were by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means popular; and the want of a more numerous audience made it easy for the professor to accommodate his instructions to the fixed attention and rapid progress of his new pupil, who became singularly attached to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, and to all the methods which he employed. Lalande attended, however, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the physico-mathematical lectures of Lemonnier, who was more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> as a teacher, and who also took great pains for his improvement.\n\nIn the meantime he had completed his legal studies, and at the age of eighteen he was called to the bar as an advocate. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> was anxious for his return to Bourg; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> at that time Lemonnier obtained leave to nominate him as a substitute for himself on an astronomical mission to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, where he was to make observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>, corresponding with those which Lacaille was sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> to obtain. He was favourably received by Maupertuis, who introduced him to Frederic and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and was made a Member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, when he was about nineteen.\n\nHe remained a year in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, observing at night, and passing his mornings in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the integral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, under Euler's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and his evenings in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of Voltaire, Maupertuis, D'Argens, and other men of talents. It was not likely that the intercourse with such persons should confirm the principles which he had imbibed from the Jesuits; his moral conduct, however, does not appear to have been influenced by his change of sentiments. After his return to Bourg, he pleaded a few causes to oblige his friends; but the success of his operations at Berlin obtained him speedily a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the Academy of Sciences at Paris; for, in 1753, before he was twenty-one, he was chosen to fill up a vacancy in the department of astronomy, Lalande, which had been open for some years. He soon after offended his friend Lemonnier, by rejecting too harshly an unfounded objection of that astronomer to his method of computing the effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>'s ellipticity on the lunar parallax, which differed from Euler's formula. Lacaille, who drew up the report of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> appointed on the occasion, decided in Lalande's favour; but Lemonnier remained dissatisfied, and would not see him for twenty years. He had some similar discussions, at a later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, with Dusejour, who was a little too severe in criticizing some of his approximations, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had been intended to be rigidly accurate; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> friendship remained unaltered.\n\nFor more than fifty years he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be a constant and voluminous contributor to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Parisian Academy, as well as to other scientific collections. His investigations were always judiciously directed to the advancement of astronomy; but they can scarcely ever be said to have exhibited any marked features of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, beyond what might be expected from the industry of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of good ordinary abilities, confining himself almost entirely to one subject. He was always anxious to call the public attention to astronomy as a science, and to himself as an individual. Thus, on occasion of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, he addressed a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to most of the governments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, on the importance of obtaining a multiplicity of collateral observations, and he received in reply several invitations, from sovereigns whose countries were more favourably situated for the purpose than France, to come and make the observations in person. He thought it, however, unnecessary to leave Paris on the occasion; he contented himself with being the first to announce to the public the result of the most satisfactory comparisons; and his countrymen seemed to give him almost the whole credit of everything that had been done by others, in conformity with his suggestions. He was much mortified, however, in not receiving from Father <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELL\">Hell</a> an account of the observations made at Wardhus; and he was afterwards greatly inclined to dispute their accuracy, because Hell made the parallax smaller than he did by $\\frac{1}{2}$ of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>: while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> of both results, which is $8, 6''$, agrees extremely well with the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> computations: but, in the end, he did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the importance of Hell's observations.\n\nHe was constantly in the habit of passing a few months every year with his family in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and he occasionally amused himself, in the course of these visits, with mineralogical excursions, and with chemical studies. He delivered, about the year 1758, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>, before a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> at Lyons, on the advantage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> above every other form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; he even adhered to a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and expressed it openly, in times when nothing but his celebrity, as a man devoted exclusively to science, could have made it safe for him to declare it.\n\nAfter having published the Astronomical Tables of Halley, he felt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a new collection, and determined to begin with those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, which he found the most imperfect. He pursued, for this\npurpose, a regular course of observations at the Palais <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a>, where he used to go before sunrise, in the winter mornings, to see the planet in the twilight. Having occasion to refer to the observations recorded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, he found it necessary to refresh his acquaintance with the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which he had in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> neglected. But, with all his labour and diligence, his tables of Mercury exhibited, in 1786, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of 40 minutes in the time of a transit; the circumstance mortified him extremely; but it led to a revision of the tables, and he afterwards succeeded in making them much more perfect. It must be recollected, that, in the time of Hevelius, a transit was anxiously expected for four whole days before it occurred.\n\nHe next undertook to improve the tables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> and Venus; his tables of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> were, on the whole, less accurate than those of Mercury, though more exempt from great occasional errors. He had computed their perturbations in the Memoirs of the Academy; but he never thought it worth while to compare his formulas with observation. The irregularities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> were much more discouraging; he was obliged to confine himself, in discussing them, to the most modern observations; and he did not appear sufficiently to appreciate the empirical equations of Lambert, though they greatly diminished the errors of Halley's tables.\n\nWhen Maraldi had given up the management of the Connaissance des Temps, Lalande and Pingr\u00e9 were candidates for the appointment. Lalande succeeded in obtaining it; but he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> to confess that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> would have been more accurately performed by Pingr\u00e9, if his connexion with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> had not, according to the rules of the Academy, incapacitated him for the situation. He made the work, however, much more popular, as a miscellaneous publication, than Pingr\u00e9 was likely to have done; and he was less prejudiced than Pingr\u00e9 in the choice of his tables. He remained editor of the work from 1760 to 1775; it was conducted by Jeaurat from 1776 to 1787, and from 1788 to 1793 by M\u00e9chain; Lalande then undertook it once more; M\u00e9chain being engaged in some measurements with Delambre, the Academy having been abolished, and its members dispersed.\n\nLalande had been disposed to call in question the assertion of Newton and of Voltaire, that no comet could possibly come into contact with the earth; and he had proved that the effect of perturbations at least rendered their reasonings somewhat inconclusive. A short memoir on the subject, which was to have been read at a public sitting of the Academy, was accidentally omitted, as not very important, from the pressure of other business. This circumstance alarmed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of the public of Paris, who fancied that Lalande had foretold some dreadful catastrophe, which the Government was afraid to announce; and when the memoir was published, they insisted that its contents had been modified, to lessen the alarm. Dus\u00e9jour made some objections to the author's reasoning; but the whole affair was soon forgotten.\n\nA memoir on the length of the year was honoured with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> by the Academy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>. Delambre, however, thinks the determination not so good as the earlier one of Lacaille, though much better than Mayer's, which was more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> adopted. Lalande took great pains also with the subject of the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>, employing in his computations of the places of the spots an easy approximation, instead of Dus\u00e9jour's more laborious methods; but being careful to compare with each other the most distant observations of the same spot. From the existence of this rotation he thought it reasonable to infer that the sun had also most probably a progressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which would naturally be produced by any single impulse capable of occasioning a rotation. He had some discussions with Dr Maskelyne, respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of computing the equation of time, in which Maskelyne appears to have had the advantage.\n\nIn the year 1762, Delisle resigned in his favour the Professorship of Astronomy in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> de France, which he kept for nearly 46 years. He allowed the most attentive of his pupils to board with him at a cheap rate, doing his utmost on all occasions to promote their success in their studies and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Thus he brought forwards M\u00e9chain and Dagelet, and afterwards his own nephew, who completed, with so much diligence and accuracy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of the Heavens, which he had himself projected, and which had been begun by Dagelet before his unfortunate expedition. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in 1763.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was generally good, though his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> was delicate. He had an attack of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a> in 1767, which was attributed to intense application; but he completely recovered from its effects by an attention to diet, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. He then intended to leave all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to the Academy; but he afterwards gave up his family estates to his relations, and lived on his appointments only, refraining from all kinds of luxuries, in order to be the more able to do acts of liberality to his friends, whom he always sought to oblige in the most delicate manner, and often without making his services known. He had a pension from Russia in the time of the Empress Catherine; it was suspended by Paul, but restored in 1805 by Alexander.\n\nHe was not particularly successful as an observer, but used to refer to the works of his contemporaries, Bradley and Lacaille, though not exactly according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of one of his biographers, \"as Ptolemy had done to those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>;\" for Hipparchus must have been dead two centuries before Ptolemy was born. On the occasion of the disappearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of Saturn in 1774, he went to B\u00e9ziers, in order to profit by the superior serenity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> there, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of that country being supposed to be the best in France; but his observations were less valuable than others made at Paris and in London.\n\nIn the year 1798, he undertook an astronomical expedition to Gotha. He had once meditated an aerostatical voyage there; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> took care that their dangers should terminate in the Bois de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a>. He was received with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>\nat Gotha by an assembly of astronomers, that was collected from different parts of Germany. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">congress</a> was perhaps not unmixed with personal vanity; but it had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to promote, unless the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the new French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> could be considered as a political object. Lalande was by no means a revolutionary: he was sufficiently free from any prejudices of education; but he openly condemned the political opinions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and, in 1792, he even exposed himself to great personal danger, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the life of Dupont de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEMOURS\">Nemours</a>, after the 10th August; and he was equally useful to some of the clergy, whom he concealed in the buildings of the Observatory at the College Mazarin, making them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for astronomers. He had also the courage to publish accounts of Lavoisier and Bailly a short time after their deaths.\n\nThe attentions of the German astronomers gave him sincere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. He was at all times extremely sensible to compliments, and even to flattery, though very regardless of satire. He used to call himself a sponge for praise, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-cloth for censure. He professedly believed himself endowed with all the virtues, modesty not excepted. He was so fond of notoriety, that he once undertook to exhibit the variations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of Algol to the public of Paris on the Pont Neuf; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> interfered, thinking it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to prevent a disorderly assemblage.\n\nThough Lalande can only be classed in the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> as an inventive astronomer, or a mathematician, he certainly stands in the first as a professor and a popular writer. His methods of calculation have in most instances been already superseded by others more convenient or more exact; those which related to particular phenomena for want of sufficient precision, and those which were more general for want of being readily applicable, without continual repetition, to a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of concurring observations. It has been observed, that he may perhaps have been often too zealous in the pursuit of his favourite objects; but that, if he had possessed more circumspection, and less vivacity of character, he would have been more exempt from criticism, but he would have rendered less important services to science and to mankind.\n\nHis last illness was of a consumptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and he seems to have accelerated its termination by attempting too much to harden himself. He died 4th April 1807, nearly 75 years old, and in the perfect possession of his faculties. His last words, when he dismissed his attendants to rest, were, \"I have need of nothing more,\" and in a few minutes he was dead. Had he survived a few hours, he would have received a letter from Dr Olbers, announcing the discovery of a new planet; for which that distinguished astronomer afterwards received the fourth prize medal upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> founded by Lalande in 1802, for the most important astronomical discovery made in the course of the year.\n\nOf his voluminous and diversified publications a simple enumeration of the subjects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> perhaps be thought too long for perusal, though not improper for insertion in a work, which ought to comprehend a complete literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLIOGRAPHY\">bibliography</a> of the sciences.\n\n1.

We shall, in addition to what is said under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> in the Encyclopaedia, offer some remarks on the various kinds of Lamps for ordinary purposes, on Lamps for Light-Houses, on Lamps for Streets, and on the Safety Lamp.\n\nLamps are usually fed by expressed oils from vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> animal substances. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, whale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, boiled from the subcuticular fat of the whale, is used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> lamps.\n\nTallow is one of the most common substances employed for giving light. The spermaceti, which is found near the nervous substance of the spinal marrow in a particular kind of whale, is also used. There is a substance resembling spermaceti, formed by the decomposition of the muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of animals in moist places, which has been employed. Bees-wax, a vegetable substance collected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>, and which, in some of its qualities, resembles the essential oils, is one of the best materials for giving light.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> region of the globe are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings found to exist without a supply of oil derived from animals or from vegetables; and in the more fertile regions several different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, peculiar to each region, are cultivated on account of the fixed oil which is extracted from their seeds by pressure. These oils vary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. The oils fit to be employed in food are the most valued. Of the rest many have the qualities which fit them for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in lamps.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>-seed, and oil of poppy-seed, are clarified for the lamp by filtering through cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, and other processes. In the south of France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> the inferior kind of olive oil is used in lamps, and sometimes the oil of the plant called Arachis hypogaea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>. In Italy, lamp oil has been pressed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of the grape. In Piemont, walnut oil is used for lamps. On the eastern and south coasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, the inferior kind of oil of sesamum. In tropical countries, cocoa-nut oil, which, in the temperature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of Britain, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> like tallow. It is burnt in lamps made of the shell of the cocoa-nut, and of bamboo. Much of the oil used in China is obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> from the seeds of the tree called by botanists Camellia oleifera, which is extensively cultivated for that purpose; as is the shrub called Croton sebiferum, for the solid oil or tallow that the Chinese press from its fruit. Essential oils, extracted from plants by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, are too volatile, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their volatility, are too easily inflamed.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETROLEUM\">Petroleum</a> and naptha <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the earth in several places, and these sources are generally in secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, and originate from fossil vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, in a state approaching to that of pit-coal. A source of petroleum existed some years ago near Colbrook Dale, and at St Catherine's near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> deposits of petroleum and bitumen are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> of Trinidad, and in the Dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a> in Judea. Naptha is the most liquid of the oils proceeding from fossil vegetable matter, and possesses qualities very fit for burning in lamps. It is employed for this purpose at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, where the streets are lighted with naptha from Amiano in the adjacent territory. Naptha, obtained in the state of a clear colourless liquid, by distillation from pit-coal, has of late been employed for burning, in street lamps, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALCOHOL\">Alcohol</a> or spirit of wine, being more clean than oil, is convenient for feeding a lamp that serves to heat a liquid in a small vessel; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> is blue, and therefore is not suitable for giving light.\n\nIn a spirit lamp, the surface of the spirit must be covered to exclude the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, for the spirit would catch fire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> its surface were exposed.\n\nSulfuric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> is too easily inflamed, and too costly to be used for feeding lamps.\n\nIn a lamp, for the purpose of giving light without a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of heat, it is required that only a small portion of the oil shall be inflamed at once; therefore, by means of the wick, a small portion of oil, minutely divided so as to expose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> surface, is subjected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the heat; the heat decomposes the oil, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> resulting from the decomposition is burnt by the atmospheric air which surrounds the wick. In the gas lights, which,\nwithin the last few years, have come into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in many manufactories and cities in Britain, the operations of producing the gas and inflaming it, which take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in the wick of a lamp, are performed separately. The gas is obtained from pit-coal, oil, or wood, but best from pit-coal or from oil, by heating these substances strongly in a retort; and when extricated, is conveyed away in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> to the place where it is to be inflamed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the filaments of the cotton which compose the wick, raises up a small portion of oil into a situation where it may be exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of heat necessary for producing flame.\n\nIn lamps of the most common structure, the wick should not be elevated too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> above the surface of the oil, for, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPILLARY_ACTION\">capillary action</a> by which the oil rises between the filaments of the cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be able to raise it to so great a height. If the wick is too little elevated above the surface of the oil, there will not be a sufficient quantity of the oil converted into the gas, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> constitutes the flame, and the flame will be too small.\n\nMany lamps used by the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, have been found in the ruins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>. These ancient lamps are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POTTERY\">pottery</a>, painted and sculptured with various ornaments, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>. The surface of the oil in the reservoir is nearly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the lighted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the wick, which emerges from a projecting beak at the side of the reservoir.\n\nThe lamp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used in rooms at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> consists of a round reservoir, with four beaks projecting from four opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of its circumference: through the middle of the reservoir a vertical stalk passes; and on this stalk the lamp may be raised or slid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. The stalk is fixed in a foot that rests on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. The whole is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>.\n\nA lamp, which affords a faint light, is made of a waxed wick, an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, passed through the centre of a thin round piece of cork, and of a piece of card placed above the cork. Some oil is placed on the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in a glass tumbler, and the cork, with its wick, is laid upon the surface of the oil. This lamp, called a veilleuse, is commonly used in Paris for burning in bedrooms during the night, as rush lights are in London.\n\nThe lamp with a hollow cylindrical wick, which receives a current of air, both on the outside and the inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, is called, in England, an Argand lamp, from the name of one of the first makers. The principle of this lamp is described in the Encyclopaedia. The wick in Argand's lamp, as first constructed, was raised by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a>; but the method now employed to raise the wick consists in a spiral notch, which goes round outside of the interior tube. The inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> to which the wick is attached has a tooth which fits into this notch.\n\nAt fig. 2, Plate XCIV., is a representation of the most usual form of the Argand lamp. A is a reservoir, which is air tight at top, and has the neck immersed in oil, so that oil flows out of it only when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air is admitted to ascend through the neck: it contains a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of liquid, from the top of which the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> is excluded, and therefore the column is sustained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the atmosphere pressing on its base, on the same principle as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a> fountain.\n\nOil is introduced into the reservoir A, by taking it off, and holding it with the neck uppermost. The sliding tube Q is pushed so as to uncover the hole t, and the oil is poured in by the hole t; when this is done, the hole is again covered by the sliding tube, and the reservoir A is replaced in F. When the lamp is to be lighted, the hole t is opened by depressing the sliding tube by its handle z, and the oil will flow out of A till it rise in F, and in the annular cavity that contains the wick to the level of the top of the hole t. When the oil in F is lowered by the burning of the lamp, so that the surface of the oil in F is below the upper part of the hole; then a bubble of air ascends into A, and a quantity of oil descends into F, till the surface of the oil rises again to cover the upper part of the hole. It sometimes happens that the air in A is heated by the warmth of the room, and then too great a quantity of oil descends into F, in consequence of the expansion of the hot air in the upper part of A, so that the oil, not being all consumed in the wick, falls down through the tube g, and may even run over from the cup P. This is a considerable inconvenience attending oil reservoirs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> here mentioned. The hole t is closed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up the sliding tube Q, when the lamp is not burning, in order that the lamp may be inclined, without making the oil descend from the reservoir.\n\nThe cylindrical part, where the flame is produced, is composed of three tubes, d, f, g. The tube g is soldered to the bottom of the tube d, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above o, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the outer surface of the tube g and the inner surface of the tube d, is an annular cylindrical cavity closed at bottom, containing the cylindrical cotton wick immersed in oil. The wick is fixed to the wick tube, which is capable of being moved spirally; within the annular cavity is also the tube f, which is capable of being moved round, and serves to elevate and depress the wick. P is a cup that screws on the bottom of the tube d, and serves to receive the superfluous oil that drops down from the wick along the inner surface of the tube g. The air enters through the holes o o, and passes up through the tube g to maintain the combustion in the interior of the circular flame. The air which goes to perform the combustion on the exterior part of the wick enters through the holes m, with which r n is perforated. When the air in the chimney is rarified by the heat of the flame, the column of the atmosphere, of which the chimney is the base, becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than the surrounding columns; and the surrounding columns, pressing with their excess of weight, enter the lower part of the chimney, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> upward, with a rapid current, to restore the equilibrium between the adjacent columns of the atmosphere.\n\nIn some lamps, above the orifice of the tube g, and nearly at the height of the top of the flame, there is placed a circular plate of metal, of the same diameter as the tube: this has the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the\ncurrent of air into that part of the flame where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> would otherwise be produced. The same effect is obtained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the cylindrical glass chimney at R G; the contraction of the chimney was commonly employed in Paris before it was used in England.\n\nThe oil flows from the reservoir A and F through N, and occupies the cavity between the exterior surface of the tube g, and the inner surface of the tube d. The oil rises in the annular cylindrical cavity between these two tubes to the level of the opening t. The part w i is a short tube, which receives the circular wick, and slides freely on the tube g. The tube g has a hollow spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> on its exterior surface, into which enters a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> k, connected with the wick-tubes w i. The wick-tube has a catch, which works in a perpendicular slit in the tube f; and, by turning the tube f, the wick-tube will be raised or lowered; r n fits on the tube d; r n is fitted to receive the glass chimney R G; one of which is seen at s; a wire s is attached to the tube f, and is bent over the edge of the tube d, and descends along the outside of the tube d. The part n r, that supports the glass chimney, is connected, by four other wires, with the ring y, which surrounds the tube d, and is capable of being moved round. When n r is turned round, it carries round along with it the ring y, the wire s, and the tube f, and thereby operates the elevation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of the wick.\n\nThe glass chimney which rests on R N is wider at bottom, and then is contracted at R G, for the purpose of making the air rush upon the external part of the circular flame in a denser current.\n\nIn the most simple construction of lamps, the surface of oil in the oil reservoir is nearly on a level with the flame, because the capillary attraction of the wick can only raise the oil a little above the surface of the reservoir. The surface of the reservoir also is considerable, that the lamp may burn for a sufficient length of time, before it has consumed so much oil as to reduce the level of the oil below the reach of the action of the capillary attraction of the wick. Mechanists have contrived and executed lamps of various forms, with the view of removing the inconvenience of the shadow of the reservoir, which is inherent in the common lamp with one lateral beak.\n\nOne of the contrivances for diminishing the bulk of the part in which the wick is immersed, and for obtaining a supply of oil, is the bird-cage fountain reservoir described above, as being usually applied to argand lamps. This kind of reservoir is described by Cardan, and a lamp fed by it is mentioned by several writers under the name of Cardan's lamp.\n\nBaptista Porta, in treating of oil reservoirs of the kind just now mentioned, proposes that, for large lamps with many wicks, the reservoir should be placed above and without the room, and should communicate with the lamp within by a pipe. In this way, the oil would not be liable to be pressed out too rapidly by the expansion of the air in the reservoir, occasioned by the heat of the room; and several methods have been contrived for the purpose of placing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> part of the wick on the upper end of a stalk, so that very little of the sphere of rays, proceeding from the lighted wick, may be intercepted by the opaque part of the lamp. The following are some of these methods:\n\nA lamp, called the Amiens lamp, commonly used in Paris by the poorer classes, is in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. The lighted part of the wick is at top; the lower part of this cylinder, which is of tin, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> opening upwards, and is moveable up and down in another cylinder, which has a valve opening upwards. This valve is plunged in the reservoir of oil; when the wick is in want of oil, the oil is pumped up by moving vertically the tin cylinder which contains the wick. Lamps of this kind are described in the Transactions of the Academy of Sciences for 1755, p. 139; and for 1760, p. 158.\n\nA lamp for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> is made by Carcel of Paris, in which the oil is raised to the wick by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>. The pump is moved by watch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, composed of wheel and pinion, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, which is wound up when the lamp is to be lighted.\n\nIn the XXth Vol. of the Philosophical Transactions, St Clair, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Hooke, describes a lamp, in which the oil floats on water. A tube passes from the upper part of the vessel down to the water; and through this tube water is dropped, by means of which the surface of the oil is always maintained at the same level, whilst it is consumed by the flame in the wick.\n\nIn the lamp constructed by Mr Kier of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENTISH_TOWN\">Kentish Town</a>, the oil is raised to the wick, and sustained by a column of a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> in water. This liquid, being of a greater specific gravity, a column of it counterbalances a longer column of oil. The solution of salt is made of such a specific gravity, that it will support a column of oil four-thirds of its own height. This is nearly the specific gravity of the heaviest saline solution that is known to exist in any great body of natural water, namely, in the Dead Sea; the weight of the waters of this sea, of distilled water, and of oil, being in the relative proportions of 120, 100, 92. To have an idea of this lamp, imagine a syphon with two upright branches, and the junction of the branches at the bottom. The shortest branch has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> at top. The longest branch has a bulb near its lower extremity. The shortest branch is filled with a solution of salt, whose upper surface is in the superior bulb. The longer branch contains the oil, and in its upper extremity the wick is placed. In the lower bulb the surface of the oil rests upon the surface of the solution of salt.\n\nThe bulbs serve as reservoirs, prolonging the action of the machine; by means of the bulbs and the greater specific gravity of the solution, it is effected, that the abstraction of a considerable quantity of oil by the combustion in the wick occasions but a small depression in the upper surface of the solution; the height of the sustaining column of solution will become shorter in proportion as the column of oil which it counterbalances is consumed; but this diminution of the height of the column of oil will be slow, and therefore the column of oil will for a considerable time be of sufficient length to reach the wick. Suppose an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> syphon, of\nequal diameter throughout, the shorter leg of which contains a column of solution of salt, whose height is 75, and this counterbalances a column of oil, whose height is 100, in the longer leg; if now the column of oil in the longer leg be diminished in height by 10, the counterbalancing column of solution will diminish to 67.5, being 7.5 shorter than at first. But if the syphon, instead of being of equal diameter, has two dilatations or reservoirs, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> is ten times the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the tube of the syphon, one of the reservoirs being placed at the top of the short branch, so as to contain the upper surface of the solution of salt, and the other at the bottom of the long branch, so as to contain the surface where the oil rests upon the solution, then, if the same quantity of oil, as in the former example, is taken from the top of the longer leg of the syphon, the column of oil will only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> one-tenth of what it did in the undilated syphon of equal diameter, and the solution of salt will diminish one-tenth of what it did in the syphon of equal diameter.\n\nThe oil reservoir and the wick remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, and do not descend as the oil is consumed. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> takes place in two lamps now to be mentioned, because in these two lamps the oil reservoir swims in liquid that acts as a counterpoise.\n\nIn the lamp contrived by the Chevalier Edelkrantz of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, the oil reservoir floats in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, and the column of oil is maintained at the requisite height by the counterpoise of a column of mercury; in proportion as the oil is consumed, the oil reservoir and the wick which is connected with it sink.\n\nThe general structure of this lamp may be understood by conceiving a flask, with a long narrow neck, and enlarged at the under part. The flask is heavy enough to swim, when it is placed in mercury, with part of its under part immersed. The bottom of the flask is open. The flask being placed in mercury, is made to float with its neck perpendicular. Oil is poured in at the neck till the flask is full. Then the surface of the mercury at the bottom of the flask and within the flask will be depressed by the weight of the column of oil that rests upon it; and the surface of the mercury on the outside of the bulb or lower part of the flask will stand higher than the surface of the mercury within the flask. The height which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of level of the two surfaces of mercury, will be the height of a column of mercury of equal weight with the column of oil that is in the flask; and as mercury is about $14\\frac{5}{9}$ times the weight of oil, the difference of level of the two surfaces of mercury will be $\\frac{10}{14\\frac{5}{9}}$ of the height of the oil in the flask. In proportion as oil is abstracted from the upper end of the tube by the combustion in the wick, the height of the column of oil is thereby diminished, and the two surfaces of mercury will come nearer to each other, the flask sinking a little in the mercury. As the area of the horizontal section of the lower part of the flask is much greater than the area of the section of the neck, and as the specific gravities of mercury and oil are very different, it follows, that, to restore the equilibrium after the abstraction of a column of oil from the neck, the surface of the mercury within the lower part of the flask will rise by a much shorter column.\n\nIn the lamp invented by Mr Barton, Comptroller of his Majesty's Mint, a solution of salt in water is used as a counterpoise to the oil. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> consists of a light flask, open at the bottom, floating in a solution of salt, so that, when oil is poured into the flask, the surface of the oil in the neck of the flask stands at a higher level than the surface of the saline solution in which the flask swims. The wick is at the upper end of the neck of the flask, and as the area of the horizontal section of the bulb or lower part of the flask is much greater, suppose 20 times greater, than the area of the section of the neck of the flask, it will happen, that when a column of oil an inch high is abstracted from the neck of the flask, the height of the rise of the surface of the solution in the bulb or lower part of the flask will be only $\\frac{1}{20}$th of an inch. This lamp is represented at fig. 3, Plate XCIV.\n\nT is the oil reservoir, from which the oil passes upwards to the wicks m, n, p. The oil reservoir is open at bottom, at h. This is preferable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of making the reservoir with a perforated bottom, that screws off, for the purpose of cleaning the reservoir. The fluid B, in which the oil reservoir is immersed, is a solution of salt in water. This liquid is contained in a vessel RMO, which can be unscrewed at O, for the purpose of taking out the oil vessel. N and Y are two floats fixed to the oil reservoir and its tube. The column of the solution of salt c, h, presses against the oil at the open bottom of the reservoir, and maintains a column of oil in the tube to the height e; to this point e the wick descends, and raises the oil to the flame by the capillary attraction of its fibres. The specific gravities of the oil and the solution of salt must be inversely as the heights c, h, and h, e; that is, the specific gravity of the solution of salt must be made to bear to the specific gravity of the oil the same proportion that the perpendicular height e, h, bears to the perpendicular height c, h. As the oil is consumed, the water enters the hole at the bottom of the oil vessel; the surface of the water at c sinks, and the oil reservoir, with the tube and wicks attached to it, sink also. The upper part of the vessel R should be of a capacity a little less than the capacity of the oil reservoir, so that, when the water has displaced the oil, and filled the oil reservoir, the float Y may be at the bottom of the enlarged part of the water vessel R. To prepare the lamp, the exterior vessel is filled with solution of salt by the opening at l; the solution passes into the oil vessel by the open bottom h, and the oil vessel rests on the bottom of the exterior vessel. The oil is then poured in through the tube c. The oil passes into the oil reservoir, expels the water, and floats the oil reservoir, raising the surface of the water in R.\n\nAn inconvenience affecting Barton's lamp is, that the solution of salt, by the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> of the watery part, becomes more dense, and capable of supporting a higher column of oil than it did at first. The lamp of Edelkrantz, which floats on mercury, is not liable to this inconvenience, because the mercury does not alter in density by evaporation.\nBoth these floating lamps have the inconvenience, that the oil is made to run over at the wick by any accidental shock which depresses the floating part of the lamp.\n\nSeveral lamps have been constructed in which the oil is raised by the principle of the fountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">Hero</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, which is known as being employed to raise water in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMNITZ\">Chemnitz</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>. In Hero's writings, the application of this machine to raise oil to a lamp is described. Lamps of this construction were made some years ago in Paris by Girard de Marselle. Of this kind is the hydropneumatic lamp made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, tin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">japan</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>, of Snowhill, London. This lamp is formed externally like a column, 18 inches high, and 4 inches in diameter; it is made to contain oil enough to last for five or six hours. An idea of its general principle may be formed by means of the diagram at fig. 5, Plate XCIV., in which there is a descending tube, with a bulb, at A, at top. The upper part of this bulb is open. The tube, at its lower part, is curved upwards, and dilated into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> bulb, B. The tube contains oil, the upper surface of which is in the upper bulb A, and its other surface is in the lower bulb B. From the top of the lower bulb B, a tube proceeds to the top of another bulb, C, placed higher than the upper bulb A, of the first tube. This third bulb, C, contains oil, and from the bottom of this third bulb the oil rises in a tube. At the upper end, W, of this tube, the wick is placed. The whole machine is closed, and air-tight, except at the openings of A and W, and at these openings the pressure of the atmosphere acts. Thus the column of oil contained in the first tube and bulbs A, B, presses, with its own weight, and the weight of the atmosphere, on the confined air contained between the second bulb, B, and the third bulb, C, and raises up a column of oil from that third bulb. The top of this column, so raised, is at a higher level than the top of the oil in the first tube, because the bottom of the column, which is raised, is at a higher level than the bottom of the column in the first tube. The whole machine is a syphon, in which a first column of oil, of the perpendicular height <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, supports a second column of oil, CW, not of a greater height than the first column, but, by means of the column of air, BC, interposed between the two columns of oil, it is effected that the extremity, W, of the second column of oil, is much higher than the upper surface, A, of the first column of oil. In the lamp constructed on this principle by King there is a plug and valve, which serve for introducing the oil, and other particular contrivances. When the oil is to be poured in, the lamp is inverted.\n\nA lamp, of which the reservoir for the oil is in the form of a hollow ring, was contrived by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rumford, and is described by him in Nicholson's Journal, Vol. XIV. 1806, p. 23. The lamp is in the centre of the ring, with which it communicates by three straight tubes, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of radii of the ring. The stoppers which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the apertures by which the oil is poured into the ring have a small hole, which allows the atmosphere to press on the surface of the oil in the ring, and thereby permits it to flow freely to the wick. This small hole may also be placed in some other part of the ring, and not in the stopper. The ring supports an hemispherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of roughened glass, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>. These glass shades are made rough, not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a>, but by laying a coat of powdered glass on the smooth surface of the shade, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> it to the heat of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, so that the powdered glass becomes adherent, and produces a rough or frosted surface. This method of frosting glass is practised in some glass-houses situated in that district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a> called the Potteries. Lamps of this construction may be suspended from the ceiling, or placed on a stand, and are now frequently used in rooms and shops in London and Paris. They are called in London French lamps.\n\nHooke, in his treatise entitled Lamps, published in 1677, describes eight contrivances for supplying oil to a lamp equably, and as long as there remains any oil in the reservoir. This he effects by different methods of counterbalancing the oil. These inventions display Hooke's ingenuity and great knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, but require nice workmanship, and are not applicable to practical purposes. These counterpoises of Hooke also serve to form a vessel so that the whole liquid may be drawn from it in an equable stream, by tapping the vessel at the top, and to make the descent of the surface of a liquid and its discharge constant and equable, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEPSYDRA\">clepsydra</a> for showing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>.\n\nPorter's automaton lamp, constructed in London in 1784, is something similar to some of Hooke's contrivances for producing an equable supply of oil to the wick, as long as there remains any oil in the reservoir. It does not require such delicacy of execution as his counterpoised lamps. Porter's lamp is a tin box, the vertical and longitudinal section of which is a rectangular parallelogram, elongated horizontally, of which call AB the two upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, CD the two lower. This parallelopipedal box is suspended on an axis near the upper surface of the box, at a place which may be denoted by X. The axis is nearer A than B; at A is the wick, and a tube going down to the bottom of the box, along the side of the box AC. When the box is full of oil, then the space XB, behind the axis, being full of oil, counterpoises the shorter space XA. AB, the long side of the box, is horizontal; and the line drawn from the axis of suspension down to the centre of gravity is perpendicular to AB. But, when the surface of the oil falls below the axis, then the box turns on its axis, the side A falls, and B is elevated; A being heavier, by reason of the wick and wick tube, and the side AC assumes a lower position, in proportion as the oil is consumed; the line drawn from the axis down to the centre of gravity becoming more and more oblique to AB. The operation of this lamp depends upon the position of the axis X, and the weight of the wick-tube, which must be accurately proportioned, the one to the other, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>.\n\nLamps for Light-houses.\n\nLight-houses are now generally lighted with Argand lamps, which have hollow cylindrical wicks placed before reflecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a>. Several of these\nLamps for lamps are fixed on a frame, and protected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> by glass windows. The lamps of lighthouses are fed with oil, and in some places with pit coal gas, as in a light-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIESTE\">Trieste</a>, afterwards mentioned.\n\nIn many of the light-houses on the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, the frame on which the lamps are fixed is made to revolve by means of clock-work, so that to a spectator, situated in the circle of which the light-house is the centre, the light appears at its brightest at the end of a stated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of time, which is generally one or two minutes. The revolving of the light enables seamen to distinguish the light-house from the light of lime-kilns or other fires upon the coast. This distinction is of great importance, for shipwrecks have happened in consequence of mistaking the light of lime-kilns for the light of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">lighthouse</a>. The light is, in some light-houses, made of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> tinge to distinguish it from some other lighthouse not far distant. The red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the light is produced by placing windows of red glass before the lamps. Red is the only colour that can be given to the light in this way. When stained glass of other colours is placed before the lamp, it is not found to produce a change in the colour of light seen at a distance; the blue or green colour of the glass becomes insensible when seen through a great body of air which has itself a blue colour.\n\nLamps for Lighting Streets.\n\nTill within the last six years, the street lamps, used in London and in other parts of Britain, consisted almost uniformly of a deep inverted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-shaped glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> blown of one piece, and suspended by the edge in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> ring; with a tin conical cover perforated to give issue to the smoke, and within the lantern, a flat oil vessel with two or more wick holders or beaks, projecting from its circumference. Many districts of London are lighted with lamps of this form; other districts employ several kinds of street lamps of a different form. The first of these new kinds were made under the direction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Cochrane, and employed to light the streets in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Saint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, Soho, London.\n\nThe lanterns which serve to protect the light from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and weather in the new lamps in one district of London, are composed of four lateral panes and a bottom of glass, joined together by sheet iron, so that the lantern is in form of a truncated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>, inverted like the lanterns of the street lamps in Paris. In lanterns of this form some light is intercepted, and a shadow is thrown on the street by the metal that unites the panes. This defect does not occur in the lanterns of street lamps most commonly used in England, and made of one piece of glass blown into the form of a spheroid. The spheroidal lanterns deflect the light more, because they are more unequal in thickness, but this is a smaller inconvenience: the lanterns blown of one piece of glass are more easily cleaned. Many of the lanterns for gas lights are also made of panes in the above mentioned form; some are cylindroids blown of one piece with a hole in the bottom to admit air. In some of the new lamps, in London, which have lanterns of one piece of glass, the form of the lantern is nearly cylindrical; in others, the lantern is not so deep as the lanterns of the old form. The new lamps have reflectors placed above the light, for the purpose of reflecting the light downwards on the foot pavement. These reflectors are of various forms, in some of the lamps, the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> surfaces of the inside of the pyramidal cover of the lantern are made bright, and serve to reflect the light downwards. In other lamps the ceiling of the lantern is a reflector in form, having a small portion of a large curved surface with a chimney in the middle to give issue to the smoke. Others have two, and sometimes three, concave conoidal reflectors, whose vertices meet over the light, the axes of two of the reflectors being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the direction of the street: at the point where the reflectors meet there is a chimney through which the smoke ascends. The reflectors require to be frequently wiped in order to keep them bright.\n\nThe oil vessels of the new lamps in London are of various forms; the beak, or part of the oil vessel under the wick, is made as narrow as possible, for as it is very near the flame, its shadow thrown on the street by the rays diverging from the flame is several feet in breadth. If the beak be an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and situate an inch under the flame, the shadow of the beak on the pavement, under the lamp, will be ten feet broad, if the flame is situate ten feet above the pavement. In some of the new lamps, the reflector placed above the light is made with its concavity so disposed at the edges, that the reflected light is thrown upon that part of the pavement which is under the oil holder. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Cochrane's lamps, the oil vessel consists of a bird-cage fountain reservoir, which allows a supply of oil to come down to the wick, when the surface of the oil in which the wick is placed has sunk to a certain point. The wick is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, consisting of two pieces of flat cotton web; between the wicks is a slit through which a current of air ascends to the flame, and on the outside of each wick is another slit; these slits admit currents to the exterior surface of the wicks. Each time that the lamp is trimmed two pieces of wick are inserted, just sufficiently long to last the time that the lamp is required to burn. Naptha distilled from pit coal is burnt in these lamps, and the light is brilliant like the light of coal gas. But the gas lights have the advantage of being unencumbered by the opaque substance of the oil vessel, which intercepts light, and casts a shadow on the street.\n\nThe street lamps in London are fixed at the end of iron rods which project from the walls of the houses. The lamp is, over the middle of the foot pavement, ten feet from the ground. There is a row of lamps on each side of the street, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> street being fifty feet in width. In Paris, where many of the principal thoroughfare streets are not above twenty-five feet in breadth, the lamps are suspended over the middle of the street. A strong rope is made fast to the walls on each side of the street, and to this rope a smaller rope with the lamp is attached. The smaller rope passes over pulleys, and comes down into an iron box, where it is fixed on a hook. The iron box is unlocked, and the lamp is let down and lighted with a candle. The light is\nplaced before a silver-plated reflector. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> the street lamps are fixed on the upper end of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>. The lamp is taken out of the lantern by means of a pole, and lighted at the foot of the post. This saves the inconvenience which results to passengers from the mode of lighting lamps, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a> and torch, as practised in Britain. In most of the towns of Italy the streets are but sparingly lighted. The lamps are fixed at the end of iron rods which project from the walls of the houses. In some of them the light is placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of a parabolic reflector, or at the meeting of the vertices of two concave conoidal divergent reflectors situated above the light. The French, when masters of Italy, made regulations to improve the lighting of the streets.\n\nIn England whale oil is used as the combustible material in the streetlamps; of laternaphtha, obtained from the distillation of pit coal, has been used in a district of London which is lighted with Major Cochrane's lamps. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPHTHA\">naphtha</a> is a clear and colourless liquid, and is found to give a good light; it requires to be prepared with particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; that made at the gas light work is said to be too easily inflammable. In Paris rape seed oil, and poppy seed oil, are used: these expressed oils are made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-eastern part of France and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>. In the south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> olive oil of inferior quality and walnut oil are used. Street lamps lighted with the gas distilled from pit coal are now (1821) employed in the principal streets of London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEFFIELD\">Sheffield</a>, and other cities in Britain. The use of coal gas for giving light had made very little progress in France in 1818, being scarcely employed even in Paris, and we believe not at all at Lyons, although pit coal is abundant and commonly used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> there. In 1818, pit coal gas was used for lighting a light-house on the Adriatic in the dominions of the House of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> near Trieste; the gas being obtained from the coal wrought in the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\n**Safety Lamp.**\n\nThis lamp was constructed for the purpose of giving light in mines where fire damp prevails. In many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COLLIERIES\">collieries</a> of Britain, Flanders, and other countries, fire damp, consisting of carburetted hydrogen, issues from different parts of the strata of coal when the coal is worked; and when the fire damp is mixed with a certain proportion of atmospheric air, it explodes by the flame of the miner's candle, burning the workmen severely, and often depriving them of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Vegetable substances, in the slow decomposition which takes place in them, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, give out inflammable gas. This is seen when the leaves of plants fall into water and become putrid, inflammable gas then rises to the surface in bubbles, and is inflamed if a light be applied to the surface of the water. Vegetable matter gives out inflammable gas also in the rapid decomposition occasioned by fire. The flame of vegetable substances consists of the inflammable air resulting from their decomposition, and burning with the addition of the air of the atmosphere. Pit coal consists of the remains of large quantities of vegetable substances, and the fire damp of coal mines may be considered as the produce of the putrefaction which the vegetable matter has undergone, or of some decomposition that the coal is still undergoing. Sir Humphry Davy found that, on breaking some masses of coal under water, inflammable gas was given out. In some places blowers of fire damp issue out at the surface of the earth. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> from Pietra Mala in the Apennines, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a> to Florence, there is a blower of inflammable gas issuing from the ground, and proceeding from strata of schistus, and perhaps of coal; Sir H. Davy analysed this gas, and found it to be carburetted hydrogen, like the fire damp of the coal mines. Another blower of the same kind exists on the side of a mountain near the shore of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADALIA\">Adalia</a>, in Lycia, on the south coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>. In mines wrought to obtain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> and salt, where there are no strata of vegetable matter like coal, it does not appear that the fire damp occurs.\n\nThe merit of that very ingenious and most useful contrivance the Safety Lamp is wholly due to Sir Humphry Davy. After having made many experiments for the purpose of forming a lamp to give light in coal mines affected with firedamp, without occasioning explosions which frequently prove fatal to the miners, he found that wire gauze, of which the apertures occupy more space than the cooling or radiating surface of the wire, so as to be permeable to air and light, offered a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>; because, although the gas was inflamed within the inclosures formed by the wire gauze, yet the heat being communicated to the numerous surfaces of the wire, the gas on the outside of the wire inclosure was not inflamed. Wire gauze is the best material for safety lamps, as it affords the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of radiating surface, and by cooling, prevents all explosions that require a temperature higher than the temperature of the atmosphere. An example of the radiating and cooling action of wire is seen in the fire guards of wire, which are hung upon the ribs of fire places in rooms to prevent sparks from being thrown into the room. These fire guards, although they are very near the fire, do not become hot. The apertures of the wire gauze must be smaller, and the wire, which is the radiating and cooling surface, must be in greater quantity; in proportion as the gas in which the lamp is to be used is more inflammable. The fire damp in coal-mines is in almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> carburetted hydrogen; and for excluding explosion from a lamp in that gas, it is found that the wire gauze should contain 784 apertures in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> inch.\n\nThe wire gauze should be of iron or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. Fine brass wire is improper, because it is too easily combustible by reason of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> it contains. The iron wire should not be tinned, tin being too easily combustible. The body of the lamp should be of copper riveted together, or of massy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-brass or cast-iron. The screws should fit tight; no aperture, however small, should be suffered to exist in the body of the lamp; and the trimming wire should move through a long tight tube.\n\nThe safety lamp is represented in Plate XCIV. fig. 4. A is the cistern containing the oil; B the\nbrass rim to which the bottom of the wire gauze cylinder is fastened by a screw to prevent it from being separated from the lamp; C is the safe feeder through which oil is poured into the lamp; E the safe trimmer, a wire which passes through a safe tube, for the purpose of raising and trimming the wick; F the wire gauze cylinder. The longitudinal suture where the two edges of the piece of wire gauze that forms the cylinder meet, must be well doubled and fastened with wire. If the cylinder is of twilled wire gauze, the wire should be of iron or copper, at least of the thickness of $\\frac{1}{10}$ of an inch; if of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> wire gauze, the diameter should not be less than $\\frac{1}{10}$ of an inch. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of apertures in a square inch should not be less than 784. The wire gauze cylinder F is closed at top by a circular piece of wire gauze, and above this is placed a second top, G, which fits on the cylinder like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> the circular wire gauze top of the wire gauze cylinder is seen at G through the wire gauze of the cap. The circular top of this wire gauze cap is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch above the top of the wire gauze cylinder F. II I are thick wires surrounding the wire gauze cylinder, to preserve it from being bent by external force. K is a ring to hang up the lamp, or to hold it by. The most convenient size for the safety lamp is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAN\">span</a>, that is, from 8 to 10 inches high, the wire gauze cylinder being 2 to 2$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in diameter.\n\nThe wire gauze, when choked with coal-dust, requires to be cleaned by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, in order to transmit the light.\n\nIn figure 4, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> of glass, L, is placed before the light, sometimes a piece of tin is placed within the cylinder to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a reflector.\n\nThe light of the safety lamp, without a reflector, was found to be nearly equal to the light of a common miner's candle.\n\nFlame produced by the combustion of explosive gases may be extinguished by colder metal. The temperature of metal, even when heated to a white heat, is less than the temperature of flame, and therefore red hot wire gauze in sufficient quantity, and of the proper degree of fineness, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> sufficient heat from the flame of carburetted hydrogen or fire damp to extinguish that flame.\n\nFlame, in all cases, is considered to be the combustion of an explosive mixture of inflammable gas and air. If a piece of wire gauze is held over the flame of a lamp, it prevents the flame from passing. The air that passes through is very hot, and is in the state of an explosive mixture, for it will be inflamed if a lighted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> be presented to it. But it is cooled below the exploding point, by passing through the wires, even if the wires are red hot; it is also cooled by being mixed with a considerable quantity of air comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>. The temperature of visible flame is very high, as is seen by the fusion of a small filament of that difficultly fusible metal platinum, which happens when the filament is held in the flame of a candle. A considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of heated metal is required to inflame fire damp. An iron wire of $\\frac{1}{10}$ of an inch in diameter, and 8 inches long, red hot, when held perpendicularly in a stream of fire damp, did not inflame it. But wire of the same size, when six inches of it were red hot, and when it was held perpendicularly in a bottle containing an explosive mixture, so that successive portions of the gas were heated by the wire, produced an explosion.\n\nThe action of the safety lamp may be exhibited in the chemist's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>, by pouring some ether into the bottom of a large jar; the vapour of the ether mixing with the air, produces an explosive atmosphere. When the safety lamp is lighted and placed in the jar, the explosive mixture from the ether will burn within the wire gauze lamp, without inflaming the gas that is without it.\n\nThe workman who has only a single gauze lamp, and finds the temperature of the wire increasing rapidly by the fire damp from a blower, can easily diminish the heat by standing between the current and the lamp, that is to say, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a> of the lamp, or by sheltering the lamp from the current by interposing his clothes; or, by bringing the lamp nearer the orifice from which the fire damp issues, he may extinguish it. There never can be any occasion for the workmen to place the lamp in the exact place, when two currents, one of common atmospheric air, and the other of fire damp, meet each other.\n\nWhen the fire damp is inflamed in the wire gauze lamp, coal-dust thrown into the gauze cylinder burns with strong flashes, but the explosion is not communicated to the external fire damp by this means.\n\nPhosphorus, sulphur, pyrites, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, would produce explosion, by being applied to the outside of the wire gauze cylinder; and sulphur, to produce this effect, must be applied in large quantities, and blown upon by a current of atmospheric air. But there is little danger of these substances being accidentally applied to the safety lamp in mines.\n\nWhen a wire gauze lamp is made to burn in a very explosive atmosphere at rest, the heat of the wire gauze, when the fire damp is burning within the lamp, soon arrives at its maximum, and then diminishes. The coally matter also, from the decomposition of the oil, chokes the upper apertures of the wire gauze, and thus gradually diminishes the heat, by diminishing the quantity of gas consumed. Wire gauze lamps which had been used by workmen for several months, and which had been often red hot in explosive atmospheres, were nevertheless still unimpaired and perfect.\n\nWhere the lamp is placed in a current of explosive gas a greater heat is produced, and in this case the radiating or cooling surfaces should be increased. Twilled gauze, or a double or triple fold of wire gauze on one side of the lamp, or a skreen of metal between the lamp and the current, or a semicylinder of glass or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICA\">mica</a> within, answers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of preventing the heat from rising to redness.\n\nIf the heat of the iron wire gauze rose to that of a strong welding heat, a circumstance which never could happen in a colliery, then the iron wire would burn, and the lamp would be no longer safe.\n\nFrom a mine of Mr Lambton's there is a violent blower of fire damp conveyed to the surface, upon which the following experiment was made. A brass pipe was fixed upon the blower-tube, so as to make\nthe whole stream of fire damp pass through an aperture of less than half an inch in diameter. The fire damp when inflamed issued from this with great violence and noise, forming a flame of five feet long. This blow-pipe was exposed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles to a strong wind. The double gauze lamps soon became red hot at the point of action of the two currents; but the wire did not burn, nor did it communicate explosion. The single gauze lamp did not communicate explosion as long as it was red hot, and slowly moved through the currents; but when it was fixed at the point of the most intense combustion, it reached a welding heat; the iron wire began to burn with sparks, and the explosion then passed.\n\nIn other experiments on this blower of fire damp, single wire gauze lamps, with slips of tin-plate on the outside, or in the inside, to prevent the free passage of the current, and double lamps, were exposed to all the circumstances of the blast; but the heat of the wire never approached near the point at which iron wire burns, and the explosion was not communicated. The flame of the fire damp flickered and roared in the lamps, but did not escape without the limits of the wire gauze.\n\nThe sparks from a flint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> mill, a machine which sometimes has been used to give light in mines affected with fire damp, would most probably inflame such a current as the blower above mentioned; because the sparks elicited from steel by the collision of flint, are small portions of the steel in a burning state, as may be seen by collecting these sparks on a sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and viewing them with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>.\n\nThe lamp without flame, which is sold as an object of amusement and curiosity, consists of a fine wire of platinum of \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) of an inch in diameter, coiled into a spiral, and placed round the wick of a lamp fed with the spirit of wine, and a little above the wick; when the flame of the lamp is blown out, the heat which the wire has acquired is sufficient to keep up the slow combustion of the vapour of the spirit of wine, and this combustion continues to keep the platinum in an ignited state. The principle of this lamp without flame may be usefully applied to the safety lamp. By hanging some coils of fine wire of platinum above the wick of the lamp, it is believed that the coal miner will be supplied with light in mixtures of fire damp, which, from the small proportion of atmospheric air, are no longer explosive; and should the flame of the lamp be extinguished by the quantity of fire damp, the glow of the incandescent platinum will continue to give light, and the incandescence will cease when the air becomes unrespirable. Sir Humphry Davy found that a spiral wire of platinum, of \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) th or \\( \\frac{1}{70} \\) th of an inch in diameter, suspended within the safety lamp, yields light in a mixture of fire damp with atmospheric air, in which the atmospheric air is in so small a proportion, that the mixture is not explosive. In this situation the heat is not sufficiently great to produce combustion with flame, and combustion without flame takes place. The platinum wire, heated by the flame of the lamp, retains its heat after the flame is extinguished, and this heat is sufficient to occasion a slow combustion or combination of the elements of the fire damp with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> of the atmospheric air; this slow combustion produces sufficient heat to keep the platinum in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IGNITION\">ignition</a>. Platinum and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALLADIUM\">palladium</a> are the only metals found to produce this effect, because these two metals are of a slow conducting power and capacity for heat. This phenomenon takes place in mixtures of gas where there is common air enough to support the respiration of human beings.\n\nAt Wallsend and other extensive collieries near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, the following regulations respecting the safety lamps are observed. A steady man is employed to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the lamps, and he is responsible for keeping them in good order. A chamber is allotted him, in which he keeps oil, cotton, and spare lamps; the chamber is in a secure part of the mine, as near the workings as possible. The brass collar of the wire gauze cylinder is secured to the bottom of the lamp by a lock, which can be opened only by the lamp keeper; so that the workmen cannot separate the wire gauze cylinder from the bottom of the lamp. After finishing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s work, the colliers bring the safety lamps to the lamp keeper's cabin. The lamp keeper unlocks the lamps, keeps the bottom, and allows the colliers to take the wire gauze cylinders home for the purpose of cleaning them. When the colliers return to their work next day, the lamp keeper having replenished the lamps with oil and cotton, lights the wicks, screws on the gauze cylinders, and examines them carefully; if any defect appears in the gauze, the lamp is set aside to be repaired. The lamp keeper's business, during the day, is to walk leisurely through amongst the workmen, carrying some spare lamps with him to replace those which happen to be extinguished.","sp":501,"ep":509},{"h":"LANARKSHIRE","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> CLYDESDALE, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> in Scotland, situated between 55\u00b0 20' and 55\u00b0 56' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude, and 3\u00b0 25' and 4\u00b0 22' west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>; is bounded on the north by the counties of Dunbarton and Stirling, on the east by those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, Linlithgow, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUMFRIES\">Dumfries</a>-shire on the south, and the shires of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYR\">Ayr</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RENFREW\">Renfrew</a> on the west.

Of the Lower, the greater part is a highly ornamented district, particularly the banks of the Clyde, which are thickly planted with villas, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> residence of the wealthy inhabitants of the city of Glasgow.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> river, and, in a commercial point of view, the greatest in Scotland, is the Clyde, from which the county is frequently called Clydesdale. It has its rise in the ridge of mountains which separate Lanarkshire from Dumfries-shire, and flowing first north and then north-west, through the middle of the county, falls into the frith of the same name above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENOCK\">Greenock</a>, carrying with it the waters collected from 1200 square miles. The principal streams which join it on the south are Duneaton, Douglas, Nethan, Avon, and West Calder, and on the north the Medwin, Mouse, South and North Calders, and Kelvin which separates Lanarkshire from Dunbartonshire.

The celebrated falls have been described in the Encyclopaedia, under the article Clyde.\n\nSandstone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> are the prevailing rocks in the lower parts of Lanarkshire, and argillaceous schistus in the high grounds. In the Cathkin hills, near Glasgow, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of basaltic columns, more than 40 feet high, inclined at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of about 70\u00b0.

But coal is by far the most important of its mineral treasures. It is supposed to stretch throughout an area of about 70,000 acres, and including the different seams to be about five feet thick. The field near Glasgow contains eight seams, one of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> feet thick, the whole amounting to upwards of 30 feet. There are several good seams of cannel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> coal in different parts of the county. This kind has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> used by the lower classes for lighting their houses, and it is known to yield more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> coal.\n\nThe valued rent of Lanarkshire is L.162,118, 16s. 10d. Scots; and the real rent of the lands, mines, and quarries, in 1811, was L.298,019, 3s. 1d., and of the houses L.286,071, 13s. 5d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. More than three-fourths of the county is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of great landholders, and almost half the valued rent is divided among estates of upwards of L.1000; but small properties are very numerous, the far greater number being below L.100 of valued rent. These small estates, with many of the class immediately above them, are cultivated by their Lanarkshire owners; the large ones are let out to tenants on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>, except the inclosed grass lands, a great part of which is let out from year to year for grazing only.\n\nThe arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is, for the most part, divided into farms of a moderate extent, held on leases for 19 years; but it is not an uncommon practice to let the grazing lands for two or three crops only, for which a high rent is often obtained. In 1798, according to the Agricultural Survey, the sheep pastures in the mountain districts yielded a rent of from 6d. to 1s. 6d. the Scots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, and the arable land in that quarter 8s. In the Middle Ward, the wastes were still less valuable than in the Upper, and its arable land was estimated at 14s. an acre. In the Lower Ward, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rent was computed to be 25s. It is probable that all these sums may now be nearly doubled. Much of the arable land in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is dry and fertile; clay prevails in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and third; and along the banks of the Clyde there are considerable tracts of an alluvial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\nAs this county slopes to the west almost throughout its whole extent, the Atlantic exerts a powerful influence on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. For about two-thirds of the year, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from the south-west and west; intense frosts are of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, and snow seldom lies long in the lower districts; but, from the general humidity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and also of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, seed-time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> are often late. In regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, there is a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the Upper and Middle Wards, the thermometer on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> standing several degrees higher in the latter than in the former. Its range is from 11\u00b0 to 85\u00b0. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> that falls at Glasgow varies from 19 to 36 inches. Lanarkshire is, therefore, upon the whole, less favourable to the culture of corn than the eastern counties of Scotland.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> is accordingly an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of considerable importance here, and is carried on in all its branches. Besides the dairies kept in and near the city of Glasgow, for supplying the inhabitants with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, cream, and fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, a great number of cows are kept in the Middle and Lower Wards, the milk of which is applied to the making of butter, new milk, and skim milk cheese, and the fatting of calves. The best cheese is similar in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to the Dunlop cheese of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a>. Clydesdale has been long famous for its draught horses. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> and Dairy, in this Supplement.\n\nBesides the grounds in the environs of Glasgow, from which the city is supplied with small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and culinary vegetables, there are considerable orchards in the county. Most of them are on the banks of the Clyde, from the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the influx of the South Calder. The trees are chiefly apple, with a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a>, and some plums. About 20 years ago, 300 acres were occupied with orchards, and their extent now is said to be greater. The produce is extremely precarious, but the land, which is for the most part on the steep banks of the river, is of little value for any other purpose. A much larger extent of the banks is occupied by coppice; and throughout the county a considerable space has\nLanarkshire been allotted to plantations, which consist chiefly of Scots fir and larch.\n\nLanarkshire is traversed by good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> in all directions; and, besides the Clyde, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of which has been much improved by deepening and confining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the river, it has the advantage of possessing an inland navigation, by means of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>. These are, the Forth and Clyde Canal, which enters it on the north, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Calder, and, after a course of eight miles, passes into Dunbartonshire at the aqueduct over the Kelvin;\u2014at Stockingfield, a collateral branch proceeds to Port Dundas, at Glasgow; the Monkland Canal, from the coal-works in the parishes of Monkland, to the Forth and Clyde at Port Dundas; and the Ardrossan Canal, which is completed, from Port Eglinton, near Glasgow, to the village of Johnston, a distance of eleven miles, and is intended to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to Ardrossan, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Ayrshire, 22 miles farther.\n\nThe city of Glasgow, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, has been described in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Glasgow in the Encyclopaedia and in this Supplement. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are, Lanark, Hamilton, Rutherglen, Biggar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATHAVEN\">Strathaven</a>, and Kilbride. Lanark, the county town, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> burgh, 32 miles south-west of Edinburgh, and 25 south-east of Glasgow, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of importance so early as the time of Alexander I. In 1811, the parish contained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of 5667. Hamilton is situated on the Clyde, 38 miles west of Edinburgh, and 11 south-east of Glasgow, with a population of 5453. In the neighbourhood is the seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Hamilton, and three miles below is Bothwell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a>, noted for the defeat of the Covenanters, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 22, 1679; see Hamilton, in the Encyclopaedia. Rutherglen is a royal burgh, on the Clyde, 2\u00bd miles above Glasgow. See this also in the Encyclopaedia. Biggar is a little market town, on the borders of Peebles-shire, 27 miles south south-west of Edinburgh. Strathaven and Kilbride are small towns near Hamilton; the former has been long noted for its veal. There is a number of villages in the vicinity of Glasgow, which, by their situation, belong to that city, and several of considerable extent, in different parts of the county. Among the latter may be mentioned, Crawford, Carnwath, Airdrie, Douglas, Leadhills, Wilstown, and New Lanark. At New Lanark, there is the largest establishment for cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> in Scotland. Mr Owen, whose arrangements for the comfort and instruction of his people have been eminently successful, is the principal proprietor. The cotton-manufacture, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-works, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COLLIERIES\">collieries</a>, give employment to the greater part of the inhabitants of Lanarkshire. Every great establishment has a considerable village in the neighbourhood, where the workmen reside.\n\nThe county of Lanark sends to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> one Representative, who is chosen by about 100 freeholders; and its three royal burghs have a share in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of two members more; Glasgow and Rutherglen being joined with Renfrew and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUMBARTON\">Dumbarton</a>, and Lanark with Selkirk, Peebles, and Linlithgow. It has one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">Sheriff</a>-depute, whose jurisdiction extends over all the county, and three substitutes, at Lanark, Glasgow, and Hamilton. Lanarkshire contains 47 parishes, of which 11 belong to the Presbytery of Lanark, 14 to that of Hamilton, and 13 to that of Glasgow, all in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of Glasgow and Ayr; and 9 to the Presbytery of Biggar, in the Synod of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TWEEDDALE\">Tweeddale</a>. The increase of the population has been uncommonly rapid, particularly that of the city of Glasgow. The following tables exhibit an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the census of 1800 and 1811.\n\nSee Naismyth's General View of the Agriculture of Clydesdale\u2014Beauties of Scotland, Vol. III.\u2014The General Report of Scotland\u2014and Playfair's Account of Scotland, Vol. I.\n\n### 1800\n\n| HOUSES | PERSONS | OCCUPATIONS |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n|        |         |             |\n|        |         |             |\n|        |         |             |\n\n### 1811\n\n| HOUSES | PERSONS | OCCUPATIONS |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n|        |         |             |\n|        |         |             |\n|        |         |             |\n\n*In the enumeration of 1800, the parish of Dalserf was not included; the population of which, in 1791, was 1100.*","sp":509,"ep":511},{"h":"LANCASHIRE","t":"a great commercial and manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west of England.\n\nThis district, which is situated between $53^\\circ 23'$ and $54^\\circ 24'$ north lat. and between $2^\\circ 18'$ and $3^\\circ 7'$ west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>., has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a> on the north-east and north, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> on the east, Cheshire on the south, and the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a> on the west. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> length is about 74 miles, and its greatest breadth 44\u00bd, but the boundaries being very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, its outline is about 342 miles, which comprises an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of 1765 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 1,129,600 acres. Lancashire forms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the northern circuit, is situated within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a>, and divided into 61 parishes. The other divisions are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, of which there are six, namely, Lonsdale on the north, Amounderness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACKBURN\">Blackburn</a>, and Leyland in the middle, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALFORD\">Salford</a> and West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a> on the south. Most of these are again popularly subdivided, according to their relative situation, or the names of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>.\n\nThe greater part of this county, from Rossall Point, on the north, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERSEY\">Mersey</a>, on the south, except where it is indented by the estuary of the Ribble on the west, lies tolerably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> in the form of an irregular square. To the north of Rossall Point, till it meets the county of Westmoreland, it is very narrow, with a sinuous boundary on all sides; and to the north-east there is a considerable tract called Furness, separated from the rest by extensive sands, where the river Ken, from Westmoreland, discharges itself into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a> of Morecombe. Opposite the south point of Furness is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> Walney, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, of which the largest is Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>. On the north-east and north much of the surface is occupied with hills and moors, particularly in Furness, where the highest grounds have the name of Fells; and also on the east, where it is bounded by Yorkshire; but the south and west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> spread out for the most part into low and fertile tracts, though not without being interrupted by pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fields of moss. Chat-moss, near Worsley, and Pilling-moss, farther to the north, are the most extensive, but many other though smaller tracts occur in various parts. Along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> there is also a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> marsh-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, particularly towards the north, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a> and Warton, at the estuaries of the Leven and Duddon, in the north-east or Furness district, and about the banks of the island of Walney.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of Lancashire is chiefly distinguished for its humidity. According to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> kept at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a> from 1784 to 1792, the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> yearly was 24\u00bd inches in 1788, and the greatest 54\u00bd in 1792. At Lancaster, in the latter year, the quantity of rain was nearly 66 inches. Four inches have been known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the course of a night. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> at Lancaster, from 1784 to 1790, was $51^\\circ 8'$. The prevailing winds are from the south, south-west, and north-east. As fogs are not frequent, nor the stagnant waters of any considerable extent, the climate is not insalubrious.\n\nThe soils of this extensive district are necessarily various. The higher grounds, covered with heath and broken with rocks, have a sterile moorish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; but towards their base, and in the vallies which they form, it is for the most part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of holme. Loam and clay of various degrees of consistence prevail on the flat grounds, with portions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, gravel, and moss; and on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, and at their estuaries, there are large tracts of an alluvial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. The under stratum of the heathy grounds is sandstone or freestone of different colours; a blue rock, popularly called whinstone, is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the Fell tracts of Furness. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a> prevails on the north-west, and towards the eastern boundaries. This and the freestone rock occasionally come in contact with one another in a very remarkable manner, a striking instance of which occurs near the town of Chipping, at the termination of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> ridge of Longridge Fell. In some places towards the eastern border, coal approaches so near the surface, as to constitute the substratum of the soil, and may be seen cropping out at Townley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, and on the rising grounds on both sides. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">Marl</a> is frequently found below the soil in the low grounds, and also under the mosses. Much of the vale land consists of rich pastures and meadows; what part of it is under tillage is very productive, and in many instances of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to yield turnips and other green crops, as well as grain. A strong clayey loam, however, appears to be the predominant soil throughout the low grounds on the south and west, which, with the wetness of the climate, renders cultivation more difficult and hazardous, than in many other districts.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> mineral substances are coal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, minerals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. The first, and in a manufacturing district by far the most important of these, is in great abundance in several parts of the county. The great coal tract commences below <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESCOT\">Prescot</a> on the south, and, crossing the county in a north-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, passes into Yorkshire; but coal abounds farther to the south-east, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, and also to the north above Lancaster. Its quality, as well as the thickness of the beds, and the depth at which it is wrought, has considerable diversity; but it is chiefly of a bituminous description. Cannel coal is found near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WIGAN\">Wigan</a>, and at other places, and sometimes in contact with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> coal, or a little mixed with it, as at the pits near Layton-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>. Copper is met with in the rough barren <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, towards the northern extremity of the high Furness, or Fell district, particularly at Coniston, Muckle Gill, and Hartriggs; but has not been found to the south of Lancaster Sands in such quantities as to be wrought with advantage. Lead occurs towards the north and northeast parts of the county, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great quantity. Iron is wrought to the north of Lancaster Sands, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of Furness. Though found in other quarters, it is not in much abundance, so as to make the working of it profitable. In the northern part of the high Furness tract quarries of blue slate have been opened. Sandstone is wrought in most parts of the county south of the Sands, and limestone, though it is found also in the Furness district, is most abundant on the Lancaster side. The main tracts of this rock are in the northern divisions above Lancaster, and near Chipping and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLITHEROE\">Clitheroe</a>, towards the borders of Yorkshire. More to the\nLancashire, south, that is, throughout the larger and more valuable portion of the county, it occurs but seldom, and not to a great extent.\n\nLancashire is naturally well supplied with waters, of which its inhabitants have industriously availed themselves in their manufacturing establishments, and in facilitating the transport of their products of all kinds. The principal rivers are the Mersey, the Irwell, the Ribble, and the Loyne or Lune. The Mersey, after receiving the Etherow and the Goyt from Cheshire, and the Tame from Yorkshire, becomes a large river at the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STOCKPORT\">Stockport</a>, and after a winding course between this county and Cheshire, enters the Irish Sea a little below the town of Liverpool. By means of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> cut, it has been made navigable for vessels of 60 or 70 tons from Liverpool to the mouth of the Irwell, up which river the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to Manchester.\n\nThe Irwell, which has its source among the hilly ranges to the south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HASLINGDEN\">Haslingden</a>, also receives several streams, and flowing through a part of Manchester, where it is advantageously employed by the different manufactories, especially those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>, and calico-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>, falls into the Mersey a little below Flixton. The Ribble is a large river which intersects the county from east to west. It enters Lancashire from Yorkshire, above the town of Clitheroe, and flowing through the beautiful vale of Ribblesdale, joins the Irish Sea a little below the town of Preston, to which it is navigable for small vessels. The Loyne or Lune, also a large river, has its source in the fells of Westmoreland, and comes into Lancashire a little below Kirkby Lonsdale, and passing by the town of Lancaster, afterwards expands into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> estuary, and empties itself into the Irish Sea. The Alt, the Douglas, the Wyer, the Winstre, the Leven, the Crake, and the Duddon, are also considerable streams; and many others, though in a general description not worthy of notice for their size, afford the most important facilities to the manufactories established on their courses. There are several pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in the county, known by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, waters, meres, and tarns. Of these the most considerable is Coniston lake, or Thurston water, and Esthwaite water, both in Furness. With these may be mentioned the lake of Windermere, which, though not properly belonging to Lancashire, enters it by its southern point, and forms its boundary for eight or ten miles. Mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> have been found at Cartmel, Flukeborough, Wigan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATHAM\">Latham</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, near Ormskirk, and other places.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> by which a great part of this county is traversed in almost every direction, it would be difficult to give an intelligible description without references to a map, and the limits of this article admit only of noticing them very generally. The great importance of an interior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> by water had been recognized in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> before any attempt was made to form one entirely artificial. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was to render some of the rivers navigable, as in the instance of the Mersey and Irwell, already mentioned, to effect which acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> were obtained in 1719 and 1720. But the droughts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> which affect the navigation of these and other rivers, have been found to occasion so much inconvenience, that more recently a preference has been given to channels of communication formed wholly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> labour. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of this description in Lancashire, and probably in England, was the Sankey canal, from the Mersey to near St Helen's, which, including its branches, extends nearly twelve miles. It was finished about sixty years ago. Besides this canal, the county is intersected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> others, four of which communicate with the populous town of Manchester. Of these we can only notice the more considerable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Bridgewater's Canal, in so far as it belongs to Lancashire, commences in the suburbs of Manchester, and terminates at Pennington, near the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEIGH\">Leigh</a>. Under the town of Manchester a portion of it passes into arched tunnels, from one of which coals are hoisted up out of the barges below, through a shaft, and delivered into a large coal-yard in the main street. Before it reaches the coal-works at Worsley, it is carried under ground for three quarters of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. The Lancaster canal commences at Kirkby <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a> in Westmoreland, and terminates at West Houghton, to the eastward of Wigan, after a course of 7\u00bd miles. The principal object in executing this great work was to open a ready communication between the coal and limestone districts, and between the port of Lancaster and the populous towns on the north and south. It is on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> seven feet deep, and is navigable by boats of 60 tons burden. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEEDS\">Leeds</a> and Liverpool canal is of still greater length. It extends between the towns of Liverpool and Leeds, along a line of 107\u00bd miles; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> at the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIRE\">Aire</a>, which is navigable to the German Ocean, and at the former with the Mersey, which falls into the Irish Sea; the navigation is thus completed between the eastern and western seas. On this canal flats of 42 tons are employed in the coal trade between Leeds and Wigan, and passage-boats are in constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> between these towns. The other canals, though works of great importance when each is considered separately by itself, are much inferior to those we have mentioned.\n\nA considerable portion of the territory of this county belongs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to his Majesty, as Duke of Lancaster. The greater part of this consists of what is called forest lands; all of which are situated in the most northern parts. It is held in general on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> for thirty years, and yields but an inconsiderable revenue. A few other estates are also of a considerable extent, but, generally speaking, landed property is much subdivided, and hence Lancashire has a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of land-owners than any other county in England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> excepted; many of the estates not affording a rental of \u00a3200 a year, and not a few being below \u00a350.\n\nLancashire does not excel in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. Agriculture. Only about a fourth of its surface is computed to be under corn and other tillage crops, the other three-fourths, subject to a deduction for wastes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, &c., being chiefly occupied in grazing and for the purposes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a>; and it has been estimated that it does not raise corn sufficient for the support of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> for more than three months in the year.\nAll the different sorts of corn, however, are cultivated, and where the soil is naturally fertile the crops are often abundant; but turnips and other ameliorating crops are not in general use, nor always, where grown to some extent, properly attended to. Potatoes, however, are cultivated not only upon a large scale but with great care and success; this root, with oatmeal, forming the principal food of the working classes. They were introduced into this county from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and are said to have been cultivated here long before they had found their way into most other parts of England. Lancashire was long noted for its breed of horned cattle, but a variety of other breeds have been introduced, particularly the Holderness, or short-horned, which are preferred to the Lancashire in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> dairies near the town, and sometimes also in those at some distance, where the principal object is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>. The native breed is the kind more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> kept for the cheese dairies, farther into the interior. A cow yields, upon an average throughout the year, from eight to twelve quarts of milk daily, or from four to six pounds of butter in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, or from three to four hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of cheese in the year. A considerable number of good horses are bred and reared, but its sheep stocks are inconsiderable, and seldom of a valuable description. Farms are generally small, and held either on short leases or without any lease at all, so that a tenant has no encouragement to invest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> in the improvement of the soil.\n\nThis district, however, is greatly distinguished by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, which afford employment to three-fourths of its crowded population. Of the former, that of cotton, which is here conducted in all its branches on the most extensive scale, has long been the most considerable. The town of Manchester, where it seems to have had its origin in England, is still its principal seat, though several of the other towns, such as Preston, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARSTANG\">Garstang</a>, Blackburn, Clitheroe, Middleton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURNLEY\">Burnley</a>, Wigan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">Bury</a>, Bolton, and Ashton, have a considerable share of it, and, indeed, it is more or less spread over the greater part of the county. (See the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">Cotton Manufacture</a> and England in this Supplement.) At Ravenhead, near Prescot, plate-glass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> are made to a considerable extent; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a>, and copper works, are carried on at Wigan and at St Helen's; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRINGTON\">Warrington</a> has manufactures of sail-cloth, linens, and checks, with the making of pins and glass, and iron-founderies; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCHDALE\">Rochdale</a> and Ashton furnish a variety of the coarser articles of woollen.\n\nFrom the great extent and variety of its manufactures, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to infer that its commerce must be upon a scale proportionally extensive, and it is so. Liverpool, as a commercial town, is now perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; and to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> it has attained from a very low beginning little more than a century ago. In prosperous times, the enterprise of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> exchanges the products of British capital and industry with those of almost every climate; and, at all times, it carries on an extensive commerce with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> and the West Indies, and with Ireland; to which has been recently added a large share of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> trade. The ports of Preston, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTON\">Poulton</a>, Warrington, Ulverston, and Lancaster, the county town, are chiefly employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> trade.\n\nAs a considerable portion of the people of Lancashire are employed in working up goods for a foreign market, the condition of the labouring classes, in particular, is much affected by the changes which occur from time to time in that market, and which it is not always possible to anticipate. They are sometimes in the receipt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> more than sufficient for their comfortable subsistence, and at other times many are thrown out of employment altogether, and the rest retained at wages confessedly inadequate to their support. This is true in an especial manner of its great staple, the cotton manufacture. From this cause, and perhaps also owing to the inconsiderate habits and want of foresight, which such fluctuations are apt to engender, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of this county amounted, in 1815, to about L400,000, whereas, 40 years before, they were little more than L50,000.\n\nAccording to the census of 1811, the population of Lancashire was 828,309, which, taking its area as before stated at 1765 square miles, gives for every square mile nearly 470 inhabitants. The number of males was 394,104; of females, 434,205. There were 23,305 families, chiefly employed in agriculture; 114,522 chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and the families not comprised in these two classes were 24,072.\n\nThe returns for Manchester, in 1811, exhibit a population of 98,575; for Liverpool 94,376; and Wigan, Warrington, Oldham, Blackburn, Bolton, Rochdale, Preston, and Lancaster, contained each 10,000 inhabitants and upwards.\n\nThis county sends 14 members to Parliament; Representatives for the shire, and two for each of the towns of Liverpool, Newton, Wigan, Preston, Clitheroe, and Lancaster.\n\nSee Beauties of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, Vol. IX.; Dickson's General View of the Agriculture of Lancashire, 1815; and the article Lancashire in the Encyclopaedia.\nIn the articles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">Language</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOLOGY\">Philology</a>, of the Encyclopaedia, a philosophical and critical account of the origin and structure of the most remarkable languages has been given at length, and in detail. The subject <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> at present be resumed in a point of view more strictly historical, and a classification somewhat more extensive of all the known languages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> world will be attempted; some of the materials being almost necessarily derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a> of Adelung and Vater, and the publications of Jamieson and of Townsend, together with the criticisms on those works inserted in the Quarterly Review.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the affinities of various languages is so far one of the most important of all branches of human knowledge, as it affords, when properly applied, an unerring test of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or falsehood of historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, without which it would sometimes be impossible to unravel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of contradictory testimonies, respecting the relations of the different races of mankind. We have, for example, no traditional evidence in support of any connexion between the ancient Egyptians and the Indians, while, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, a number of persons, who came with the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, from the East Indies into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, were so strongly impressed with the resemblance of the Egyptian and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, which appeared even to excite the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> feelings of many of the natives who were among the troops employed, that a very general inclination has arisen from these circumstances, to consider the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a> as merely a branch of the Indian. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the Egyptian people had really been of Indian origin; that is, if the Egyptians and Indians had really been one people, at any later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> than that, at which the whole of the Indian and European races were separated from their common stock, the languages of India and of Egypt could not but have exhibited some features of resemblance, which would have preserved the traces of the connexion; while, in fact, there is much less similarity between the Egyptian and the Indian, than between the Indian and the Greek, or the English and the Persian; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> may here be adduced as confirming the evidence, or as justifying the silence, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; and the resemblance of the mythological representations must be considered as in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> accidental.\n\nIt is, however, only with regard to the languages of the ancient world that we can feel much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. The American dialects might afford equally extensive subjects of speculation in a metaphysical and critical point of view; but the concerns of barbarians, unconnected and remote from all contact with literature or civilization, and destitute of all historical records, will scarcely be thought to require any great portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> from a philosophical inquirer; and there is ample scope for the employment of all our faculties in the Languages <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the various languages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. If, indeed, an extraordinary exertion of enterprise and industry, which can be expected from a few distinguished individuals only in the course of as many centuries, should make known relations, such as Alexander von Humboldt has appeared to discover, between the American and Asiatic nations, a new field would be opened for the gratification of our curiosity; but it can scarcely be expected that these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of resemblance can be sufficiently numerous, to afford anything like demonstrative evidence, until the whole subject has been much more deeply and repeatedly discussed. In the mean time, a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> enumeration of the names of the American languages is all that can be required, on an occasion like the present; except the insulated though interesting remark, that the countries separated by Behring's Straits exhibit, as might indeed be expected, strong resemblances, in some of their languages.\n\nOf language in general this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> is not intended to treat, but merely of languages as they are distinct from each other. It is not, however, very easy to say what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> ought to be that should constitute a separate language; but it seems most natural to call those languages distinct, of which the one cannot be understood by common persons in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of speaking the other, so that an interpreter would be required for communication between persons of the respective nations. Still, however, it may remain doubtful whether the Danes and the Swedes could not, in general, understand each other tolerably well, and whether the Scottish Highlanders and the Irish would be able to drink their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHISKY\">whisky</a> together without an interpreter; nor is it possible to say, if the twenty ways of pronouncing the sounds, belonging to the Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, ought or ought not to be considered as so many languages or dialects, though they would render all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> intercourse between the persons so speaking the language actually impracticable. But, whether we call such variations different languages, or different dialects, or merely different pronunciations of the same dialect, it is obvious that they ought all to be noticed in a complete history of languages; and, at the same time, that the languages so nearly allied must stand next to each other in a systematical order; the perfection of which would be, to place the nearest together those languages, in which the number of coincidences in the signification of words, throughout the language, are the most numerous.\n\nIt has sometimes been imagined, that all languages in existence present something like a trace of having been deduced from a common origin; and it would be difficult to confute this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> by very positive evidence, unless every separate language had been very completely analysed and examined by a person\nLanguages well acquainted with a variety of other languages, with which it might be compared. But, without such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, the opinion must remain conjectural only, and no more admissible as demonstrated, than the opinion of some empirics, that there is only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, and that the only remedy for it is brandy.\n\nIn an essay on probabilities, lately published in the Philosophical Transactions, Dr Young has remarked, that \"nothing whatever could be inferred, with respect to the relation of two languages, from the coincidence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of any single word in both of them;\" that is, supposing the same simple and limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of sounds to occur in both, but to be applied accidentally to the same number of objects, without any common links of connexion; \"and that the odds would only be three to one against the agreement of two words; but if three words appeared to be identical, it would be more than ten to one that they must be derived, in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, from some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> language, or introduced in some other manner,\" from a common source; \"six words would give near 1700 chances to one, and eight near 100,000; so that, in these last cases, the evidence would be little short of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> certainty.\"\n\nThe author of the Review of Mithridates observes, that, setting out from the establishment of a certain number of separate languages as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, \"we may proceed to comprehend, in the description of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, such as have more coincidences with each other than diversities, and to refer to the same class such families as exhibit any coincidences at all that are not fortuitous, imitative,\" that is, from onomatopoeia, \"or adoptive. In order, however, to avoid too great a number of classes, which would arise from an inadequate comparison of languages imperfectly known, it may be proper, in some cases, to adopt a geographical distinction, as sufficient to define the limits of a class, or to assist in its subdivision into orders. We are thus obliged to employ an arrangement of a mixed nature;\" and, in fact, the tests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> here proposed depend so much on the progress of our knowledge, in the study of each language, that the results must unavoidably be liable to great uncertainty and fluctuation; so that we can reasonably expect nothing more than an approximation to an arrangement completely methodical.\n\n\"If,\" continues the Reviewer, \"the resemblance or identity of a single word, in two languages, supposed to be exempt from the effects of all later intercourse, were to be esteemed a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of their having been derived from a common stock, it would follow, that more than half the languages of the universe would exhibit traces of such a connexion, in whatever order we might pursue the comparison. Thus we find in a very great number, and perhaps in a majority of known languages, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of the vowel \\(a\\), with a labial consonant, is employed for the name of Father; and if this be supposed to be something like an onomatopoeia, or an application of the first sounds which an infant naturally utters, the same reason cannot possibly be assigned for the still more general occurrence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> \\(nm\\) in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Name, which is by no means likely to have originated from any natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of this kind. But neither these points of resemblance, nor any other that can be assigned, are absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>; for besides the numberless varieties referable more or less immediately to Abba, Father, we have at least twenty different and independent terms for the same relation in the old world;\" Tia, Issa, Plar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">Hair</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAMA\">Rama</a>, Diam, Bina, Ketem, Assaina-lagi, Medua, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THERES\">Theres</a>, Sink, Iot, Anathien, Meese, Indua, Nu, Nam, Monung, Dengalay, Ray, Tikkob, and Oa; and about as many for Name, besides those languages, in which the version of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> term of this kind is less likely to have been ascertained; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-MING\">Ming</a>, Tren, Diant, Sheu, Hessara, Shem, Tsarship, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">Ad</a>, Nipu, Lium, Sacheli, Assia, Wasta, Ngala, Tai-ra, Sanna, Ran, Hili, Ding, Dbai, and Anghara.\n\n\"At the same time, therefore, that we venerate the traces of our common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a>, wherever they are still perceptible, we must not expect to find them in all existing languages without exception; and an Etymologicon Universale, considered as intended to establish such a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of derivation, can only be regarded as a visionary undertaking. Nor must we neglect to unite, in some common arrangement of classification, those languages which have the words here specified, or any other radical words, in common, as incomparably more related to each other than the Chinese to the Cantabrian, or the Irish to the Hottentot.\n\n\"The gradations, by which a language is likely to vary in a given time, seem to be in some measure dependent on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of cultivation of the language, and of the civilization of the people employing it. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> to the Byzantine historians, the Greek language remained essentially the same for 2000 years; the German has varied but little in 1500; and even the English, notwithstanding its mixture with French and Latin, has altered but three radical words, out of the fifty four which constitute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRAYER\">Prayer</a>, in the same period. On the other hand, a few barbarians in the neighbourhood of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a> and of the Caspian Sea, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> origin, and ignorant of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, are divided into more nations speaking peculiar languages, radically different from each other, than the whole of civilized Europe. In such cases, little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> can be thrown upon history by etymological researches, while, with regard to more cultivated nations, we obtain, from the examination of their languages, historical evidence of such a nature, as it is scarcely possible for either accident or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to have falsified.\"\n\nAccording to the supposition of Professor Adelung, it seems not improbable that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIBET\">Tibet</a>, on the east of Cashmir, may \"have been the habitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> immediately after his fall, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> occupied by the descendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIN\">Cain</a>. In Tibet, and in the countries immediately beyond it, the languages of at least 150 millions of people are still principally Monosyllabic, and from this peculiarity, as well as from the singular simplicity of their structure, they are supposed to constitute the most ancient class of existing languages, though it must be confessed that much of Adelung's reasoning on this subject is extremely inconclusive.\" Mr Townsend remarks very judiciously, that one of the canons of Rudbeck is by no means admissible. \"He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>,\nthat a language, which has numerous monosyllabic expressions, is a parent language. The English has more than 3700 monosyllabic expressions, and the Chinese has none but such; yet neither of them is, for that reason, to be considered as a parent language. Certain it is, that all languages, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a>, have a tendency to become monosyllabic, and therefore a language, which abounds in monosyllables, is ancient, and these commonly are the most antiquated parts of every language. New compounds are incessantly created. These are abbreviated, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time become monosyllabic. In deriving, therefore, a word in one language, from its correspondent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> in some other language, we must ever bear in mind, that, unless in the formation of new compounds, the least abbreviated is commonly the parent, and the most abbreviated its offspring. Would it be possible for any one to persuade us that Collanus was derived from Cuff, or Blasphemy from Blame? \"A similar instance,\" says the Reviewer, \"might be found in Trachelos and Hals of the Greeks and Germans; for certainly Hals is more like Trachelos than like Collum.\"\n\nThe Chinese, however, which is the principal, and probably the most ancient of the monosyllabic languages, is distinguished from almost all others by a more marked peculiarity, which is, that its written characters, instead of depicting sounds, are the immediate symbols of the objects or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, and are even imperfectly represented by the sounds, whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> or tone may be exhibited by the most refined speaker; as indeed it may happen accidentally in our own language, that we may be at a loss to explain, without circumlocution, whether we mean to say Son or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a>; Beer or Bier; Bear or Bare; You, Ewe, Yew, or U; but in the Chinese the real cause of this essential characteristic appears to be, that the symbol was in fact originally intended as a hieroglyphic or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the object, though the resemblance, coarse as it probably was at first, has been generally altogether lost by the modifications which the character has conventionally undergone. And in this point of view the Chinese would require to be classed with the old Egyptian only, since we know of no other language which was habitually expressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> and their immediate derivatives. It is not at all uncommon for the same sound in Coptic, as in Chinese, to have four or five senses all essentially different; as may easily be observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>; hoo, for instance, means Bud, and Them, and a Shower, in two verses of St Matthew, v. 45, 46, and perhaps several other things.\n\nAnother ancient and extensive class of languages, united by a greater number of resemblances than can well be altogether accidental, may be denominated the Indo-European, comprehending the Indian, the West Asiatic, and almost all the European languages. If we chose to assign a geographical situation to the common parent of this class, we should place it to the south and west of the supposed origin of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; leaving the north for our third class, which we can only define as including all the Asiatic and European languages not belonging to the two former; which may be called Atactic, or, perhaps, without much impropriety, Tataric; and which may be subdivided into five orders, Sporadic, Caucasian, Tartarian, Siberian, and Insular. The African and American languages will constitute a fourth and a fifth class, sufficiently distinct from all the rest, but not intended to be considered as any otherwise united among themselves, than by their geographical situation. There is indeed little doubt, that some of the languages here called Tataric are essentially allied to others, which are referred to the Indo-European class; but they have been too little investigated, to allow us to make the selection that would be required for completing the classification.\n\nThe following tables are copied, with some considerable additions, from the Quarterly Review, where they stand as extracted, in great measure, from Adelung's Mithridates. The words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a> are chosen as specimens, because they seem to be known in a greater number of languages than any others, except the name of Father, which is supposed to exhibit, in some cases, a fallacious similarity. The German orthography has been principally employed, except in such languages as are usually written in the Roman characters, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSONANTS\">consonants</a> being more uniform than in English, and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOWELS\">vowels</a> differing little from the Italian.\n\nClasses, Orders, and Families of Languages.\n\nI.

The strongest proof of the great antiquity of the Chinese language appears to be the great simplicity of its structure, and the want of those abbreviations and conventional implications which have been sometimes called the wings of languages. It is natural that, in attempting to express ideas at once by characters, the rude pictures of material objects should first have been principally, if not exclusively traced; thus the Egyptians had \u2609 for the sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and \u2295 for a country or field, and the Chinese have still \u25a1, \u25b3, \u2295 for these objects respectively, the characters having been made square instead of round, which some of them were in their more ancient forms. The Egyptians represented a man by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> kneeling, and stretching out his hand, or in the encorial character, thus \u03a0. (See the article EGYPT, Pl. LXXV. n. 73.) The Chinese figure may originally have been of the same form, but at present is more like a pair of legs only, \u25b2, while a dog seems to have three or four legs; \u25b3, or \u25a1.\n\nA thousand, according to Mr Jomard's ingenious conjecture, was copied from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTUS\">lotus</a>, with its seed vessel, having a great multitude of seeds, and the Chinese is certainly not altogether unlike the Egyptian \u266b.\n\n(n. 202), nor is the character for light \u2600, which seems intended to represent a radiant body, altogether different from the \u2609 or \u2295 so often found among the hieroglyphics of Egypt, although it is not easy to believe, with Mr Palin, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> found with the mummies agree precisely with a Chinese version of the Psalms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, character for character. The successive introduction of figurative expressions and characters may easily be imagined, but it would be useless to enter at present into further details of this kind on grounds almost entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a>. The Chinese are said to have been, in the ninth century, a race of people resembling the Arabs; their physiognomy was contaminated, in the thirteenth and fourteenth, by a mixture with their conquerors, the Mongols; but their language remained unaltered. The dialect of Tonkin is sometimes called the language of Anam, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-GUAN\">Guan</a>; on occasions of state they use the Chinese character, but more commonly a character of their own, probably resembling that of the Siamese. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> observes, that at least twenty different nations employ the Chinese characters, though they read them quite differently; and he considers the Cochinchinese, the Cantonese, and the Japanese, as all essentially different from the Mandarin Chinese, though they have all some words in common. He gives us, as the names of the dialects of Chinese, constituting almost as many separate languages, 1, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KONG\">Kong</a>, spoken at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a>; 2, Way; 3, Nam; 4, Chew; 5, Sew; 6, Lui; 7, Limm; 8, Khum, or Mandarin; 9, Sin; 10, Kung; 11, Yong san, spoken at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACAO\">Macao</a>; 12, San takh; 13, Nam kei; 14, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">Plan</a> ngi; 15, Tong khun; 16, Fo khun; or Chinchow. There is also a language spoken by the Quan to, between Tonkin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, a people who consider themselves as more ancient than their neighbours. Notwithstanding, however, all this supposed diversity, we may trace a considerable resemblance in the spoken language, even as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COREA\">Corea</a>. In all these dialects, the conversation is a sort of recitative, and the different notes give distinct meanings to the words; as, in fact, we distinguish in English the sense of M! from M! or simply M.; tones perfectly understood, though never written. The Chinese are without the sound of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> r, and several other sounds common in Europe; the only way in which they express foreign words is, by putting together the characters of the nearest import, with a symbol of pronunciation annexed to them; thus, for Christus and Cardinalis they are obliged to write Ki lu su tu su and Kia ul fi na li su, with a mouth annexed to them. The names of places are generally distinguished by a square inclosing the characters which express them, and the names of men, in some books, by a line drawn on one side of the characters only. In this there seems to be a distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> which incloses proper names in the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>, but the names of places were not distinguished in this manner by the Egyptians. The dialects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMBODIA\">Cambodia</a> and Laos have received some mixture of Malayan from their neighbours;\nin writing the former of these, sometimes called K'hoimen, according to Dr Leyden, the Bali, or old Sanscrit character, is employed; and the latter has some analogy with the Siamese; indeed, both the Siamese and the Avanese are disposed to derive themselves from Laes. It may be seen, from the specimens exhibited in the article Philology of the Encyclopaedia, b. 125, that at least some of the Chinese dialects have sounds agreeing in several instances with European words of the same import; but the agreement is scarcely precise enough to justify our inferring from it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> connexion between the languages.\n\n2. The language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a> resembles the Chinese in its simplicity and metaphorical structure, though not so decidedly monosyllabic. It is obvious, however, that the distinction of monosyllabic and polysyllabic could not, in very ancient times, have been so positively laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as at present, since it was usual, in almost all countries, to write the words contiguous to each other, in a continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, without any divisions between them; and, even in modern printing, there is a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, which often restores this agreeable obscurity, under the name of a hyphen, by the use of which we avoid the difficulty of determining whether we wish to employ one word or several. The Siamese call themselves T'hai; and a part of their country is distinguished by the appellation Tai hai, or Great T'hai. The numerals resemble the Mandarin Chinese; several words of the language are borrowed from the Bali; it is written in an alphabetical character, which is said to be complicated and refined.\n\n3. The Avanese or Burmanish has also borrowed some polysyllabic words from the Bali, and is written in a peculiar alphabetical character. It must be considered as an era in the history of this country that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> has employed Mr Felix Carey, at his own expense, to establish a printing press at Ava, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, for printing a translation of the Scriptures in Burmanish. A dialect, spoken in the district called Tanengrari, is said to be of greater antiquity. The M\u00f4n or Peguan is called by Dr Leyden a distinct original language; but it is written in the Avanese character, and Adelung's specimen scarcely differs at all from the Burmanish. The language of Arakan and Rashaan is called Rukheng; it contains a number of words from the Bali, many of them converted into monosyllables by an imperfect pronunciation. Dr Leyden considers it as the connecting link between the monosyllabic and the polysyllabic languages, and he calls it an original language, notwithstanding its acknowledged derivation from its neighbours. It employs the Devanagri <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, including the letter r. Out of 50 words of Rukheng, quoted by Buchanan, the seven which are not Burman are only varieties of pronunciation. The Kiaya or Kolun, and the Kukus, northeast of Chatigong, are mentioned as neighbouring tribes, speaking languages almost entirely different from the Rukheng. We find, in Mr Buchanan's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, some specimens of the languages of the Burma empire, which it is difficult to distribute methodically, without a further knowledge of their peculiar characters, but some of which may, without impropriety, be introduced here.\n\nMyammar, in (Head, Kaung; Wind, Myacge Burma <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEE\">Lee</a>)\nYakain, in A- (Wind, Lee) rakan\nTanaynthoree Yo (Stone, Kionkag)\nMoitog, near (Head, Kop, Kok; O, Leipauk Assum Noomeet)\nKoloun, or (Head, Multoo; O, Dag Klagn Konce)\nKurayn or Kaloon Passooko (Head, Kozohui; O, Katchaykoo Moomag)\nMaploo (Head, Kohuin; O, Moo) Kolanghoo Play (Head, Kohui, Pokochui Kako, Lau- O, Mooi, Moomag) koo\n\nHindu of Burma Rooinga (Head, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATA\">Mata</a>; O, Bel) Kool Rossaven, Ara- (Head, Mustok; O, Murtiha kan Sooja)\nBanga, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AY\">Ay</a>- (Head, Teckgo; O, Matee hoba Bayllee)\n\n4. The language of Tibet, or the Tangutish, has some words in common with the Chinese, but is less simple in its structure. It is at least as ancient as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of the country, which is nearly coeval with Christianity. Its character is well known to be alphabetical, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the learned work of Father Georgi on the subject.\n\n5. The Indo-European languages have been referred to a single class, because every one of them has too great a number of coincidences with some of the others, to be considered as merely accidental, and many of them in terms relating to objects of such a nature, that they must necessarily have been, in both of the languages compared, rather original than adoptive. The Sanscrit, which is confessedly the parent language of India, may easily be shown to be intimately connected with the Greek, the Latin, and the German, although it is a great exaggeration to assert anything like its complete identity with either of these languages. Thus we find, within the compass of the Lord's Prayer only, Pida, Pitir, among the Sanscrit terms for Father, Gr. Pater; Nama, or Namadheya for Name, Gr. Onoma, Onomat; Radshiam, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">Kingdom</a>, Lat. Regnum from Rego; Manasam, Will, like the Greek Menio, and the Latin Mens; Stira, Earth, Gr. Era, whence perhaps the Latin Terra; and Danim, or Devanagri Dia, Day, Lat. Dies. There are also some singular resemblances of declension and conjugation between the Sanscrit and the Greek, as Dodami, Dodasti, Dodati; in old Greek Didomi, Didosis, Didoti. In a tablet of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> 23 B.C. we find Kritico for a Judge, Gr. Crites, Criticos. In Mr Townsend's work we also find some well selected instances of resemblance between the Sanscrit and other languages; thus Bhru, is Brow; Pota, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">Boat</a>; Bad, a Bath; Germ.

Pratham or Protoma, first, whence we may deduce both the Greek protos, and the Latin primus; and Upadesaca, Didasca, Doceo, and Disco. We have also Vayajan, wind, in Russian Vieyanie; and Vidha-va, widow, Latin, Vidua, German, Wittwe, Russian, Vdova. The rr of the plural verb is found in the Sanscrit Bhavanti, they are, Dadanti, they give. Sir William Jones and many others have attributed to some of the works, which are still extant in Sanscrit, an antiquity of four or five thousand years; but Professor Adelung denies the validity of any of the arguments, which have been adduced, in favour of a date at all approaching to this.\n\nThe Sanscrit, even in its earliest state, can scarcely have been altogether uniform throughout all the countries in which it was spoken, and it has degenerated by degrees into a great diversity of modern dialects: the term signifies learned, or polished. Beyond the Ganges, it is called Bali or Magudha, which the missionaries say \"scarcely\" differs from Sanscrit; the term Magudha is said to mean mixed or irregular. In Siam the Sanscrit is still the language of elegant literature; and it is often employed throughout India, with some little difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, under the name of Devanagara, the divine language. The Pratir is rather a vague term, meaning, according to Mr Colebrooke, common or vulgar, but it is also applied to the language of the sacred books of the \"Jainas.\" We find in a little publication, entitled, a Brief View of the Baptist Missions and Translations, some useful information respecting the Indian languages and dialects, into a great number of which these laborious and disinterested persons have made or procured translations of the whole of the Scriptures, which they have printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERAMPORE\">Serampore</a> near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>. The dialects, which they enumerate, are principally arranged in a geographical order; and beginning with those which are spoken towards the middle of India, as the pure Sanscrit and its least modified dialects, we may place next to them the languages of the countries bordering on the monosyllabic nations, towards the North and East; we have here the dialects of Nepal, Assam, or Uhumiya, Tipereh, and Kassai, of which little more is known than that translations into the first two have been already executed; the Bengalee is spoken in and about Calcutta: the Hindee or Hindudee is spoken about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGRA\">Agra</a>; it is printed in the Devanagri character, the font of which contains more than 800 varieties of letters and their combinations; the Urdu or Oordoo is a subdialect of the Hindee, as well as the Brijbassa, which is nearer to the Sanscrit than some other dialects: the Jypura is mentioned as another language, belonging to the same neighbourhood: the Hindustance is spoken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HINDUSTAN\">Hindustan</a> Proper, or Lower Hindustan; the missionaries say it is \"diametrically different\" from the Hindee: the Moors or \"Mongol Indostanish\" seems to belong to this country, being mixed with a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of Persian and Arabic, unless it be rather referable to the Hindee: the dialects of Udaipura, Benares, and Munipura, are also called separate languages: the Goandee is spoken at Nagpore, in the Mahratta country: further east is Orissa or Uriya, the language of which is printed in a character requiring 300 different types: the Telug or Warug is spoken about Cuddalore and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>: the Telenga further west: the Carnatic has a peculiar language, besides the Tamil, which is spoken from Paleacate, near Madras, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Comorin, and the Marwa, which appears to belong to a part of this country. About Cochin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVANCORE\">Travancore</a> we have the Maleaim: further north the languages of Malabar, Kanara, and of the Decan; the dialect of Malabar is of considerable antiquity, being found in two copper tablets as old as the eighth or ninth century; then comes the Kunkuna, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>: the Mahratta is further inland: the Guzurat on the coast: and beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a> the Beloosh in Belochistan: north of this we find the Afghan or Pushlu language, which contains more Hebrew words than any of its neighbours; the people are said to have come from the north, about 2000 years ago, and, according to a Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, to be descended from King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>: indeed, the language stands somewhat more correctly under the Median family in the Mithridates, but since it forms the connecting link between the two families, it might perhaps be as conveniently arranged among the more numerous species of the Sanscrit; it is written in the Arabic character, with some additional letters for expressing the Sanscrit sounds. The language of Multan, north of Sindh, has about one tenth of Persian mixed with it. The Gipsies were certainly expelled from some part of India by the cruelties of Timur Leng, about 1400; and they were probably some of the Zingans, in the neighbourhood of Multan; their language having a great number of coincidences with that of Multan, and being still more manifestly a dialect of the Sanscrit, although they have adopted many European, and especially Selavonian words. When they first appeared in Europe, they were supposed to amount to about half a million; at present they are less numerous.\n\nThe Maldivian is peculiar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of small islands from which it is named; the Baptists have already printed some books in it. The people are said greatly to resemble those of Ceylon. The Cingalese, which is spoken in great part of Ceylon, is a mixture of several of the continental dialects; and it has been observed that the proper names in Ceylon mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> are of Sanscrit origin. Dr Leyden gives as a proof of the antiquity of the Malayan, that the Temala of Ptolemy is derived from Temo, tin. The connexion of this language with the Sanscrit has not been very universally admitted; and some of those who have studied it most are disposed to consider it as wholly original; but in the purest part of the language, Dr Leyden confesses that there is a considerable resemblance to the Avanese and the Siamese; the words derived from the Sanscrit he considers as somewhat less numerous, amounting however to about 5000; they are generally less like the Bali than the Sanscrit; and a still smaller number are borrowed from the Arabic. The character of the monosyllabic languages is in some measure retained. Sir William Jones considered the Malayan as a derivative of the Sanscrit; Mr Marsden supposes it to have received its Sanscrit words through Guzurat; Dr Leyden rather from Ka-\nLanguages. linga or Telinga; and it exhibits some traces of the dialects of Tamul and Maleialam. Besides these various sources, it is said to have borrowed some of its simplest words from the Javanese and the Bugis; and it has become more nearly monosyllabic by dropping the first syllables of some of the words which it has adopted. The Javanese is said to be more ancient than the Malayan; the empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a> was formerly powerful and flourishing: the ancient language was much like the Sanscrit, more so than the Malayan, but was written in a peculiar character. Dialects of this language are still spoken in Bali and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADURA\">Madura</a>. Leyden thinks the Malays were derived from Java; Marsden rather from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a>: though he allows that there are some reasons for conjecturing that an old Sanscrit colony may have settled many hundred years ago in Java, and mixed its language with a supposed mother tongue of that Asiatic race.\n\nOf the Sumatran dialects, the principal, according to Dr Leyden, is the Batta, spoken by a people who occupy the centre of the island, and who still, like some other Indian nations, retain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of eating their old relations. The language seems to be partly original, and partly connected with the Malayan, and other dialects of the neighbouring islands. The Rejang is chiefly a mixture of Batta and Malayan; in the Lampuh or Lampung, there is also some Javanese. The Achi has admitted a still further influx of words belonging to all the Musulman jargons of the neighbourhood, especially to that of the Mapulas of Malabar. There are other dialects of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> in N\u00e9as and the Poggy Islands, most resembling the Batta. This language is provided with a peculiar alphabet, which is remarkable for being written from the bottom of the paper upwards, like the Mexican hieroglyphics: though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATTAS\">Battas</a>, as well as the Chinese, sometimes hold their books so as to read horizontally. In Borneo there appear to be several dialects, or rather separate languages, two of them, according to Dr Leyden, are the Biaju and the Tisun. The Andaman language is inserted here for want of a better place only; it does not appear to have any connexion with the Sanscrit, and may possibly be found to be more like that of Madagascar: the people seem to belong to the Papuas, a distinct original race, according to Dr Leyden, black, and with woolly hair.\n\nBesides the numerous translations into languages of the Indo-European class, the Baptist Missionaries have also printed some Armenian and Persian works at the indefatigable press of Serampore, which is supplied by a letter foundery and a paper mill, belonging to the same establishment, enabling them to execute the whole business at less than half the expense of European books of the same magnitude. The little pamphlet, already quoted, contains also specimens of the characters of the Sanscrit, Assam, Bengalee, Mahratta, Sikh, and Cashmirian, which somewhat resemble each other in the square form of their characters, as well as of the Burman, Orissa, Telinga, and Cingalese, which have a more rounded and flourished appearance; of the Tamul, which looks a little like Armenian; of the Afghan and the Persian used in India; and of the Chinese, both as printed from blocks, and from the moveable metal types which have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> at Serampore.\n\n6. The connexion of the Median family with the Sanscrit on one side, and with the Greek and German on the other, is sufficiently proved by the words Abitap, Zend. Sur, Sanscr. Abitaba; Dar, Ter, Pers. Door, Sanscr. Dura, Tuvura, Javanese, Turi, Gr. Thira, Germ. Thir, Thor; Dip, Pers. Land or Island, Sanscr. Dihp; Dochtar, Pers. Pothre Zend. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">Daughter</a>, Gr. Thugater, Germ. Tochter, Sanscr. Putri; Jar\u00e9, Zend. Year, Sanscr. Jahran, Germ. Jahr; and Ishk, Zend. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a>, Sanscr. Itsha. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> we may add, from Dr Leyden, Stree, Zend. Woman, Sanscr. Stri; Ast\u00e9, Zend. He is, Sanscr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTI\">Asti</a>, Gr. Esti; Hapl\u00e9, Zend. Seven, Sanscr. Saptah, Gr. Henta. There are also some coincidences with the Chaldee, but the Median is certainly not a dialect of the Chaldee. Sir W. Jones and others have said that the Zendish was nearest to the Sanscrit, and the Pehlvi to the Chaldee or Arabic. In ancient Media, the Zendish was the language of the northern, and Pehlei, or Parthian, of the southern parts; the word Pehlvi or Pahalevi is supposed by Leyden to have been nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with Pali or Bali, though this is said to be derived from Bahlika, an Indoeuropean country. The Zendish was more particularly appropriated to religious purposes, and the Pehlvi had in a great measure superseded it for common use at a very early period; under the Sassanides again, from the third to the seventh century, the use of the Pehlvi was discouraged, and the old Persian substituted for it. It is said, however, that in the remote parts of the country, about Shirwan, some traces of the Pehlvi may still be found in existence. The Zendavesta of Zoroaster, which is still extant in Zendish, is supposed to have been written 520 years B.C.; and Adelung follows Anquetil in asserting its authenticity, even in opposition to the opinion of Jones and Richardson. These languages have little or no connexion with the Georgian and Armenian, which have succeeded them in some of the same countries. The old Persian, which seems to be much connected with the Pehlvi, has remained in use either as a living or as a learned language ever since the time of the Sassanides; it was current among the Persians when they were conquered by the Arabs in the seventh century; and it is the language of the Shah Nameh of Firdusi, written in the tenth century, as well as of the Ayen Akbery, of which the date is about 1600. The modern Persian became a cultivated language about the year 1000, having received a considerable mixture of Arabic and Turkish words. The term Parsee is commonly applied to a corrupt Pehlvi, spoken by the refugee firework-shippers in Bombay.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a> are said to have inhabited, for some centuries, the countries about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black Sea</a>, and may originally have bordered on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>; from this circumstance, and probably also from the effects of a later irruption of the Goths into Persia, which is recorded in history, we may easily explain the occurrence of many Persian words in German, and in the other languages of Northern Europe. Professor Adelung has examined more than two hundred\ncases of such resemblances, and has found only one sixth part of them in Anquetil's vocabularies of the more ancient dialects; he has, however, omitted to state what proportion the whole magnitude of these vocabularies bears to that of a complete dictionary of the language. It is well known that an Essay was published a few years since in London On the Similarity of the Persian and English Languages; and a more elaborate work on the relations of the Persian languages, by Mr Le Pileur, has since appeared in Holland. Mr Le Pileur attempts to explain the is or s of the genitive of the northern languages, by the Persian proposition ez, which seems to be synonymous with the Greek and Latin ex; but he has not shown that this ez ever follows the noun to which it relates.\n\nThe Kurds speak a corrupt dialect of the Persian; they are probably derived from the Carduchi of the Greeks, who inhabited the Gordiaean hills. They spread into Persia about the year 1000, and are now situated on the borders of the Persian and Turkish dominions. The language of the Afghans, about Candahar, is said to contain about one fourth of Persian, and some Tartarian, besides the Sanscrit which abounds in it.\n\n7. The Arabian family is called by the German critics Semitic, from Shem the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, as having been principally spoken by his descendants. Though not intimately connected with the European languages, it is well known to have afforded some words to the Greek and Latin; it has also some in common with the Sanscrit, though apparently fewer than either the Greek or the German. Thus we have Acer, Hebr. a Husbandman; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AGER\">Ager</a>, Lat. a Field; Asther, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">Star</a>, Gr. Aster; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARA\">Bara</a>, Buri, Germ. Burg; Ben, Hebr. Son, Sanscr. Bun, Child; Esh, Hebr. Eshta, Chald. Fire, Sanscr. Aster; and Ish, Hebr. Man, Sanscr. Isha, Man or Lord. The Hebrew Ani, Anoki, I, has been noticed by Townsend and others as affording an etymology for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">Egg</a>, as well as for Ni or Mi of verbs, for the Anok of the Egyptians, and even for the Ngo of the Chinese.\n\nThe northern nations of this family have sometimes been comprehended under the name Aramaic, in contradistinction to the middle, or Canaanitish, and the southern, or Arabian. The Eastern Aramaic, or old Chaldee, is very little known; it was the language of a people situated in the north of Mesopotamia, which is now the south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a>; a part of them extended themselves further south, and became Babylonians; of whose dialect some traces are said still to exist, about Mosul and Diarbeker. The old Assyrians, between the Tigris and Media, were a colony of the Babylonians, and spoke a language unintelligible to the Jews. (II. Kings, 18.) The western Aramaic has become known, since the Christian era, as the Syriac, in which there is an ancient and valuable translation of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. It is still spoken about Edessa and Harran. The Palmyrene was one of its dialects; the modern Assyrian of the Russian Vocabularies appears to be another.\n\nThe language of the Canaanites is said, by St Jerome, to have been intermediate between the Hebrew and the Egyptian. The people are supposed to have come originally from the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILISTINES\">Philistines</a>, who were found among them, to have emigrated from the Delta to Cyprus, to have been thence expelled by the Phenicians, and to have adopted the language of the Canaanites, when they settled among them. The book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> is considered as affording some idea of the dialect of Edom; it is well known to contain many Arabisms, besides some other peculiarities. The Phenician is only known from a few coins and inscriptions found chiefly in Cyprus and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, and not yet very satisfactorily deciphered, though Akerblad is convinced, by some of them, that it varied but very little from the Hebrew; of its descendant, the Punic, or Carthaginian, a specimen is preserved in the speech of Hanno in Plautus, as happily arranged by Bochart; the objection of Adelung, respecting the want of a proper name, appearing to have arisen from a mistake. The last six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the text are probably either a repetition of the same speech in the old Lybian of the neighbourhood, or a jargon intended to imitate it.\n\nThe Hebrews originated among the Chaldeans; Terah, the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, having been a native of Ur, or Edessa, beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>; they adopted the language of the Canaanites, among whom they led a nomadic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, till their residence in Egypt, which must probably have had some effect in modifying their language. After that time, however, it appears to have varied but little, in a period of 1000 years, from Moses to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALACHI\">Malachi</a>; and this circumstance Adelung considers as so uncommon and improbable, that he is disposed to believe that the writings of Moses must have been modernised, at least as late as the time of Samuel. The old Hebrew became extinct, as a living language, about 500 B.C.; 1000 years afterwards, the Masoretic points were added, to assist in its pronunciation; and this was done in some measure upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the Syrochaldaic, which at that time was still spoken. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTUAGINT\">Septuagint</a> version, which is much older, supports, in the instances of many of the proper names, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> indicated by the points, but in about as many others it appears to deviate from that system, and to agree with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of pronunciation founded upon the text or principal characters alone. The reading in Greek letters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>, in his Hexapla, tends, on the whole, very strongly to support the points. The Chaldee had superseded the Hebrew at the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, and was gradually converted into the Syrochaldaic, which is called Hebrew in the New Testament. The Targums, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALMUD\">Talmud</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, are in the older Chaldee; and a Syrochaldaic translation of the New Testament has been discovered to be still in existence.\n\nThe Samaritan somewhat resembles the Chaldee; it was formed among the Phenicians and others, who occupied the habitations of the ten tribes, when they were carried into captivity by Salmanassar and Esarhaddon. Its peculiar alphabet is well known as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the Hebrew.\n\nThe Rabbinic dialect was principally formed in the middle ages, among the Spanish Jews, who were chiefly descended from the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>;\nwhile those of Germany and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> were generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALILEANS\">Galileans</a>, and spoke a ruder dialect of the Hebrew than the fugitives from the metropolis.\n\nThe Arabs have been a distinct, and in great measure an independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, for more than 3000 years. Some of them were descended from Shem; others, as the Cushites, Canaanites, and Amalekites, from his brother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>. Their language, as it is found in the Koran, contains some mixture of Indian, Persian, and Abyssinian words. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> was little cultivated until a century or two after the time of Mahomet. It is certainly copious, but its copiousness has been ridiculously exaggerated, and absurdly admired. The best Arabic is spoken by the upper classes in Yemen; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> it is more mixed; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> corrupt, and still more so in some parts of Africa. There are dialects which require the assistance of an interpreter to make them intelligible; at the same time, it has been maintained by Aryda, a learned Arab of Syria, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to Niebuhr, that the Arabic of the Koran is still employed in conversation among the best educated of the people, as well as in correct writing. The Arabs living in houses are called Moors; and those of Africa are the best known under this name. The Mapuls, or Mapulets, of Malabar and Coromandel, are a numerous colony of Arabs, who have been settled there above a thousand years.\n\nThe Ethiopians are descended from the Cushite Arabs. In the time of Nimrod they conquered Babylon: before that of Moses they emigrated into Africa, and settled in and about Tigri; in Isaiah's time, they seem to have extended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZ\">Fez</a>; and at present they occupy Tigri, Amhara, and some neighbouring countries. They became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> in 325, but retained the initiatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of the Jews and Mussulmen. The pure or literary Ethiopic is called Geez, or Axumitic, in contradistinction to the Amharic, by which it was superseded as the language of common life in Amhara, about the fourteenth century, although it is still spoken, without much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, in some parts of Tigri; while, in others, as in Hawasa, a different dialect is spoken. The Ethiopic was first particularly made known in Europe by the elaborate publications of Ludolf. Mr Asselin has lately procured a translation of the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> into the Amharic, as it is now spoken at Gondar; it was executed by the old Abyssinian traveller who was known to Bruce and to Sir William Jones, and it is said to be now printing at the expense of some of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>.\n\nThe Maltese is immediately derived from the modern Arabic, without any intervention of the Punic. The island, having been successively subject to the Phaeacians, Phenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and Goths, was subdued by the Arabians, in the ninth century; in the eleventh, the Normans conquered it, and it remained united with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, until it became in some measure independent, under the Knights of St John.\n\n8. The Lycian is only known from a few short inscriptions, copied by Mr R. Cockerell, and published in Mr Walpole's collection, together with two or three longer ones, which have been lately brought from Antiphellos, by the enterprising and indefatigable Mr W. J. Bankes. By means of a proper name, in Languages, one of Mr Cockerell's inscriptions, we obtain a part of the alphabet; thus i is A; \u0394, D; E, I; P, R; s; and probably \u039b, \u0397; and I, L. A further comparison of the different parts of the other inscriptions, with the Greek phrases that almost uniformly accompany them, implying \"for himself and his wife and his children;\" gives us the words A, or AT'HI, himself; SA, his, or for his, HRDI, or perhaps HROI, wife; TIDAIMI, son; TIDAIMA, children; and ATBI, and. It does not appear that any of these words would authorise us to place the Lycian language as a member of the great Indo-European class; but it is reported to have been much mixed with Greek, and on account of its geographical situation, it may be allowed to occupy a temporary rank between the principal Oriental and European languages. If it has a shadow of likeness to any other language, it is perhaps to the Cimbric; and Tidaimi may also possibly be allied to the Greek T\u016bk\u0113no, to nurse.\n\n9. Respecting the ancient Phrygian, we have a few traditions only, which at least agree in giving it a high antiquity, as the source of several Greek words. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> observes, in his Cratylius, that the terms denoting fire and water are not derived from any other Greek words, but are Phrygian primitives. It seems, however, that water was called Bedii by the Phrygians, and the word resembles the Bada, Bath, of the northern nations, as well as the Vate, water, of the Swedes; Moirai, the fates, derived from the Phrygian, is compared to Meyar, virgins, of the Gothic; and Bek, bread, is as much like our Bake, as like the Albanian Buk, bread.\n\n10. The Greek has no very intimate or general connexion with any of the older languages, which have been preserved entire, although there are a number of particular instances of its resemblance to the Sanscrit, some of which have been already mentioned; it has also many German and Celtic words, some Sclavonian, and, as it is said, a few Finnish. It can only have been immediately derived from the language of the neighbouring Thracians and Pelasgians, who seem to have come originally from the middle of Asia, through the countries north of the Black Sea, and to have occupied not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Thrace, but also the neighbouring parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, where they probably retained their ancient dialect to a later period than elsewhere. The whole of the Thracian states were greatly deranged by the expedition of the Celts, in 278 B.C., which terminated in their settling the colony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a>. The Dacians, or Getae, who principally occupied Bulgaria, extended themselves further northwards, and afterwards constituted the Roman provinces of Moesia and Dacia, which were conquered by the Goths, in the third century. The Macedonians, in the time of Alexander, spoke a language which was nearly unintelligible to the Greeks in general; even the Pelasgi, in Epirus and Thessaly, long retained a dialect materially different from their neighbours; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a> still longer. The Hellenes, who emigrated from Asia Minor into Greece, were not sufficiently\nLanguages numerous to carry their own dialect with them, although the language assumed their name. The Graeci in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> were Pelasgians, although Dionysius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALICARNASSUS\">Halicarnassus</a> includes them in the denomination Hellenic; their language must have been Aeolodic, and it was in this form that the Latin received its mixture of Greek; the Lacedemonian also retained it till a late period, writing, for instance, instead of Pais, Poir, as in Latin Puer. The Aeolic appears once to have extended over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>, and to have left some Aeolisms in the old Attic dialect. This dialect was the principal basis of the Common language of Greece at a later period, which must have been the most cultivated under the protection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, and which continued to be spoken and written in the highest circles of Constantinople throughout the middle ages; by degrees it degenerated into the modern Romaeic, having received a mixture of Turkish and Italian, and perhaps of some other neighbouring languages.\n\n11. The German family is sufficiently connected with a variety of others, belonging to the Indo-European class, to be admitted into it upon a very short investigation. Its resemblances to the Greek, within the compass of the Lord's Prayer, besides Father and Name, are Wille, Wollen, Gr. Boule, perhaps Brot or Proat, bread, like Artos, and Freyen or L\u00f6sen, like Rhiein and L\u00fcsein. Dr. Jamieson has shown very clearly, in his Hermes Scythicus, how immediately the structure of the Gothic languages is derived from that of the Greeks. Thus the ein of the Greek infinitive became in the Moesogothic an or ian, in German en; the icos of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ADJECTIVES\">adjectives</a>, Moesogothic, ags, ics, or eigs, as mahteigs, mighty; Germ. machtig; the Slavonians have ski, the Swedes ska; the inos, Lat. enus, Anglosaxon en; the licos, Latin lis, German lich, English like; thus pelicos is what like, as least in Scotland; the Moesogothic swaleiks is our such; sameleiks is similis. Los, lis, lion, of diminutives, in Latin lus, becomes in Moesogothic llo, as barnilo, a little child; in German m\u00e4nnl is a little man. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PRONOUNS\">pronouns</a> we have Ego in Greek and Latin, Moesogothic ik, Icelandic eg, Swedish jag; emou, mou, Gr., Latin mei, Moesogothic meina, German meiner; emoi, moi; Latin mihi, Moesogothic mts; Swedish mig, Dutch my; eme, me; Latin me, Moesogothic mik, Anglosaxon me, Dutch my. Si, Doric tu; Latin tu; Moesogothic thu. Is in Latin, Moesogothic is; ejus, Moesogothic is, izos; id, Moesogothic ita, English it; Quis, cujus, cui, quem; Moesogothic Quhas, quhis, quhe, quhana, the last having the n; as the Greek non; uter, whether; alter, other, seems to be derived from another, enthera, meaning one of them, so that in this instance the Gothic has the appearance of the greater antiquity, while the Greek affords, on the other hand, an etymology for ekeinos, from ekei, there, which is wanting to the Moesogothic gains of jains, the Alemannic gener, the German jener, and the English yonder or yon. Again, among the numerals, deka has been derived from deo, as if both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> were tied together, and pente has a strong resemblance to panta, as if all the five fingers were reckoned: and on the other hand, da cuig in Gaelic, meaning twice five, has been considered as the original of deca. But none of these etymologies seems to be so decisive of originality as that of caterva, which is evidently related to turba or turma; while the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> remains unexplained in Latin, but in the Celtic we have cad tarf, or cadh tarf, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> troop, agreeing undeniably with the sense. For another example, we may take ventus and wind, for which we find no Latin etymology, while the German furnishes us with wehen to blow, and thence wehend and wind; the words nodus and knot afford also a similar instance, nodus having nothing nearer to it in Latin than neo to spin, neco to unite; but in German we have kn\u00fcten to join, and in English knit and knead from the same root. The degrees of comparison are expressed in Greek by \u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; in Anglosaxon by er or era, and ist or ast. Er seems to mean before, as well as the Latin or. The Coptic has no comparative, but for better than I, the Egyptians said very good before me. It would seem at first sight natural to make than a proposition, as well as before, and to say better than me; but the fact is that in English, as well as in German, it was usual of old to say then or dem in this sense; and he is wiser than I meant only, he is wise before, then I follow. The idea of time or place is now dropped as unessential to the kind of priority in question, but the ground of the grammatical construction remains unaltered. In Moesogothic the comparative termination is 120 or ozo; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERLATIVE\">superlative</a> ists or ista; thus the Greek meizon becomes meizo; and maists is obviously megistos. The old megatos is nikils, mickle or muckle; and minor, minimus, became minito, minnits; in Persian mih is great, mihter, greater, mihtras, greatest; better seems to be from the old German bierd or bieder, upright, honest, and resembles the Persian binter, better. The Moesogothic verbs have also some striking resemblances in their form to the Latin, thus the present tense of to have is HABA, HABAI, HABAITH; HABAM, HABAITH, HABAND; HABAIT is HABAIDA; HABENS, HABANDS; HABENTIS, HABANDIS; HABENTEM, HABANDAM; HABENTES, HABANDANS. The substantive verb singular in Greek is eimi, eis, esti; the plural in Latin sumus, estis, sunt; the Moesogothic has Im, is, ist, siyum, sijuth, sind; and sis is sija\u00efs; esse, wisan. The Moesogothic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOUNS\">nouns</a> frequently retain the resemblance of the Greek more strongly than their more modern derivatives; thus a tooth does not seem to point very immediately to dentem or odonta as its source; but the older form tunthu is clearly the intermediate stage of this modification; and numberless other instances of the same kind might easily be found.\n\nThe Germans were known, as early as the time of Pythons, that is 320 B.C. as consisting of the Jutes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, the Teutones on the coast to the east of them, the Ostiaceans next, and lastly the Cassini, Cotini, or Goths. Professor Adelung imagines that the eastern nations, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEVI\">Suevi</a>, employed almost from the earliest times a high German dialect, and the western, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CIMBRI\">Cimbri</a>, a low German; the Suevi he supposes to have been driven, at a remote period, into the south of Germany by the Slavonians; and some of the Goths appear to have extended as far as\nLanguages. The Bible of Ulphila, in the Gothic or Moesogothic of 360, is the oldest specimen in existence of the German language. Besides the Greek and Latin, which appear to prevail so much in the language, it exhibits a considerable mixture of Sclavonian and Finnish; the translation is far more literal than it could be made in any of the more modern dialects of the German; and sometimes appears to follow the text with somewhat too much servility.\n\nThe modern German, founded on the higher dialects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, was fixed and made general by Martin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>. There are many shades of dialect and pronunciation in the different parts of this diversified country, but none of them of any particular interest, or established by any literary authority. There are still some German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, in the territories of Vicenza and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, called the Sette Comuni, which retain their language. The German Jews have a peculiar jargon, borrowed in some measure from their brethren in Poland, which they write in Hebrew characters; and another similar mixture of discordant dialects is spoken by the Rothwelsch, a vagabond people in the south of Germany, who have sometimes been confounded with the Gipsies.\n\nThe Low Saxon, or Platt Deutsch, is spoken about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALBERSTADT\">Halberstadt</a>; and further north, in the countries between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBE\">Elbe</a> and the Weser; it seems to be intimately connected with the Frieslandish and Danish, as well as with the English. The Frieslanders originally extended from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> to the Ems, and the Cauchi, thence to the Elbe; these countries still retain a dialect materially varying from those of their neighbours. The Brokmic laws of the thirteenth century exhibit some remarkable differences from the German of the same date: thus we find in them Redieva a judge, or Reeve, instead of Richter; Kenne, kin; and sida, side, as in Swedish, instead of seite. The Batavian Frieslandish approaches very much to the English; it has several subdialects, as those of Molkwer, and Hindelop. Some of the Cauchish Frieslanders remain in the territory of Bremen; the North Frieslanders occupy Heligoland, Husum, and Amr\u00f6m.\n\nThe Dutch language is a mixture of Frieslandish, Low Saxon, and German, with a little French. It appears, from Kolyn's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a>, to have been distinctly formed as early as 1156.\n\nThe Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family is characterized by the want both of gutturals and of aspirates, which renders its pronunciation softer and less harsh; and by some peculiarities of construction, for instance, by the place of the article, which follows its noun, both in Danish and Swedish, instead of preceding it, as in most other languages. The name of Denmark is first found in the ninth century; until the sixth, the people were called Jutes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, in the ninth century, was termed Nordmanland. A corrupt Norwegian is still, or was lately, spoken in some of the Orkneys, which were long subject to Norway and Denmark. In the eastern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a>, the language is much like the Norwegian; but, on the coast, it is mixed with Danish. The oldest specimen of Icelandic is the Jus Ecclesiasticum of 1123. The term Runic relates to the rectilinear characters cut in wood, which were sometimes used by the Scandinavian nations. The Swedes are derived from a mixture of Scandinavians with Goths from Upper Germany; but their language does not exhibit any dialectic differences corresponding to this difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>. Mr Townsend has given us a list, from Peringskiold, of 670 Swedish words, resembling the Greek; but it must be confessed that the resemblance is in many cases extremely slight.\n\nThe Saxons are mentioned by Ptolemy as a small nation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a>; whence, in conjunction with the Frieslanders, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">Angles</a> of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUTLAND\">Jutland</a>, they came over to England, about the year 450. The Saxons settled principally south of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, the Angles north. At the union of the Heptarchy, the Saxon dialect prevailed, and the English, which nearly resembled the Danish of that time, was less in use; but new swarms of Danes having inundated the north of England, in 787, the Danish dialect was introduced by Canute and his followers; and it is about this period that our earliest specimens of the Anglosaxon are dated. The Saxon dialect again obtained the ascendancy under Edward the Confessor; and although some French was introduced by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and still more by William the Conqueror, into the higher circles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, yet the use of the French language never became general among the lower classes, and the Saxon recovered much of its currency in the thirteenth century, when the cities and corporate towns rose into importance, under Edward the First; in the fourteenth century, it was permanently established, with the modifications which it had received from the French; and it may be considered as truly English from this period, or even somewhat earlier, at least if Pope Adrian's rhymes are the genuine production of 1156. It is still much more German than French; in the Lord's Prayer, the only words of Latin origin are Trespass, Temptation, and Deliver. Professor Adelung's remarks, on the simplicity of the English language, appear to be so judicious as to deserve transcribing. \"The language,\" he observes \"only received its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cultivation at the time of the Reformation, and of the civil disturbances which followed that event; nor did it acquire its last polish till after the Revolution, when the authors who employed it elevated it to that high degree of excellence, of which, from its great copiousness, and the remarkable simplicity of its construction, it was peculiarly capable. It is the most simple of all the European languages; the terminations of its substantives being only changed in the genitive and in the plural, and the alterations of the roots of the verbs not exceeding six or seven. This simplicity depends in some measure on a philosophical accuracy, which is carried systematically through the whole language, so that the adjectives, participles, and article, are indeclinable, being in their nature destitute of any idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENDER\">gender</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, or number; and the form of generic distinction is [almost entirely] confined to objects which are naturally entitled to it. The pronunciation, on the other hand, is extremely intricate, and foreign proper names, in particular, are much mutilated, whenever they are adopted by the English.\"\n\n12. The Celtic family forms a very extensive and\nLanguages very interesting subdivision of the Indo-European class. It has been asserted, by some writers, \"that the six original European languages, the Iberian, Celtic, Germanic, Thracian, Slavonian, and Finnish, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as distinct at the beginning of their history as they now are;\" but this assertion must be subjected to considerable modification; the thing is in itself so improbable, as to require far more evidence than we possess to establish it, even if that evidence were of a more decisive nature; and, in fact, it will actually be found, upon a comparison of the Gothic of Ulphil\u00e4 with the more modern dialects, that the Germanic of that day did approach more nearly, both to the Celtic and to the Thracian or Greek, than any of its more modern descendants do. The change of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUN\">tun</a>-thu* into *tooth*, for which the Germans have *zahn*, has already been noticed; the *atta* and *himina* of Ulphia seem to be more like the Irish *at\u00e1ir* and *nemh*, than the modern Vater and Himmel are; and the Moesogothic *va\u00edr*, which answers to the Cimbric *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a>*, a man, is not at present found in German, though its traces may still be observed in the *Firiobarno* of the Franks, in 1020; the antiquity of the root is shown by the Celtic names in Caesar beginning so often with *ver*, and still more strongly by the testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, that the Scythian called a man *aior*. At the same time, therefore, that we admit the propriety of considering the Celtic and Germanic as families clearly distinct, with respect to any period with which we are historically acquainted, we must not forget that they exhibit undeniable traces of having been more intimately connected with each other, and with their neighbours, in the earlier stages of their existence. The resemblances of the Celtic to the Latin are too numerous to require particular notice, the immediate and extensive connexion between these languages being universally admitted; but if any evidence were desired on this subject, it might be obtained in abundance, by a reference to Court de Gebelin's *Monde Primitif*. With respect to the Greek, the terms *Hael*, sun; *Dar*, water; *Deru*, oak; *Garan*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRANE\">crane</a>; *Crunn*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, are among the Celtic words of the most indisputable originality, and their resemblance to *Helios*, *Hidior*, *Druis*, *Geranos*, and *Cr\u00fcoen*, is equally undeniable. We find, also, in the Cimbric, *Bas*, low, connected with *Bathis*, *Bara*, bread, perhaps with *Bora*, food; *Deyrnas*, kingdom, with *T\u00faranms*: *Dyro*, give, with *Doreue*; and *Gogoriant*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, perhaps with *Gaurion*, exulting. With the German it is easy to find a number of very near approaches to identity, even in that Celtic, which can be proved, principally from the etymologies of proper names, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the date of any known or supposed secondary intercourse or mixture of the natives concerned; thus we have, either accurately or very nearly in the same signification, *Ap*, *Affe*, or *Ape*; *Barra*, *Barre*; *Bleun*, *Blume*; *Bolgan*, *Balge*; *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIG\">Brig</a>*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERG\">Berg</a>*; *Brogil*, *Br\u00fchl*; *Carra*, *Karre*; *Doga*, *Teich*; *Galb*, *Kalb*; *Garan*, *Kranich*; *Gnabat*, *Knabe*; *Lancea*, *Laune*; *Mare*, *M\u00e4hre*; *Marga*, *M\u00e4rzel*; *Redya*, *Reiten*; *Rit*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAT\">Rat</a>*, *Rad*; and *Ur*, *Auer*; and it is impossible to suppose that so numerous a series of coincidences can have been derived from accidental causes only.\n\nThe Celts may be imagined to have emigrated from Asia after the Iberians, or Cantabrians, and before the Thracians, or Pelasgians, settling principally in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, and spreading partly into Italy, under the name of Ausonians and Umbrians. In 570 B.C., they undertook expeditions, for the purposes of conquest, but they were subdued by the Romans. Their language was current in Gaul till the sixth or seventh century, when it was superseded by the rustic Roman, which by degrees became French; in Ireland and Scotland, it has remained with few alterations; in Wales and Britanny, it has been more mixed. The Gauls must have peopled Britain at least as early as 500 B.C. The true ancient Britons are the Highlanders of Scotland only, having been driven northwards by the Cimbri; they still call their language Gaelic. The Irish are probably derived from these Highlanders; they were originally termed Scots or Scuits, that is, fugitives, from the circumstance of their expulsion from Britain; so that, where the Scots are mentioned before the tenth century, as by Porphyry, in the third, we are to understand the Irish. Gildas, in 564, sometimes calls them Scotch, and sometimes Irish. After the retreat of the Romans from Britain, a part of them re-entered Scotland, about the year 503, and changed its name from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALEDONIA\">Caledonia</a> to Scotia Minor. In 432, St Patrick laid the foundation of the civilisation of Ireland; and, in the seventh century, several Irish priests undertook missions to the continent. At the beginning of this century, some Scandinavian freebooters had begun to visit Ireland; and, in the year 885, they formed large colonies of emigrants, who established themselves firmly in that country, and in the Scottish Islands, bringing with them many Gothic words, which became afterwards mixed with the Celtic, and which seem to constitute about one fifth part of the modern Irish and Gaelic, 140 Gothic words being found under the first six letters of the alphabet only. Some of these Normen remained distinct from the Irish till the year 1102. The oldest specimens of the Irish language, admitted by the continental critics to be authentic, are of the ninth century; though some of our antiquaries have imagined they have discovered records of a much earlier date. The Gaelic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Man is mixed with Norwegian, English, and Welsh. A Gaelic colony, formerly established at Walden, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, has been placed by Chamberlayne in Italy, as a nation of Waldenses.\n\nThe Cimbric or Celtogermanic language was remarked by Caesar as differing from the Gallic, although the distinction has not always been sufficiently observed. The Cimbrians seem to have existed as a nation 500 or 600 years B.C.; the Gauls called them Belge; they invaded Britain a little before Caesar's time, and drove the ancient inhabitants into the Highlands and into Ireland. Having called the Saxons to their assistance against the Scots and Picts in the fifth century, they were driven by their new allies into Wales, Cornwall, and Britanny. Their language is remarkable for the frequent changes of the initial letters of its radical words, in the formation of cases and numbers; thus from *Den*, a man, in *Britannish*, is derived the plural *Tud*; from *Vreg*, a woman, *Groges*. Almost half of the\nWelsh language seems to be German, and half of the remainder is perhaps Latin or Celtic; of the Britannic about half resembles the Latin or French. Britanny was originally inhabited by the Armoricans; whether they were properly Belgae or Gauls is uncertain; the country was named Britannia Minor from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a> of the British in 449; these new comers mixed with the original inhabitants, all speaking the same language, and in a few years became so numerous, as to be able to send an army of 12,000 men to the assistance of the Emperor Anthemius.\n\nProfessor Adelung is disposed to consider the German portion of the different branches of the Celtic, which varies from one fifth to one half of the whole language, as an accidental mixture, and derived through different channels. But we cannot in all cases find any historical evidence of the existence of these channels; it is difficult, for example, to suppose that the Scandinavian incursions were able at any early period to influence the language of the Highlands of Scotland; and wherever it happens, as it frequently does, that no term is to be found, in the Irish, the Gaelic, or the Welsh, for expressing the same idea, besides the word that they all have in common with the German, it is scarcely possible to believe that there ever was any other Celtic word, which has been so uniformly superseded by independent causes. We find, for instance, under the two first letters of the alphabet only, the words Ap, or Apa in Irish, Ap in Welsh, Agfe or Ape in Gothic; again Abal, Asial, Apfel; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">Anger</a>, Aneang, Enge; Bacail, Bach, Backen; Barad, Barr, Bare; Beoir, Bir, Bier; Biall, Biroll, Beil; Bocan, Bwch, Bock, Brathair, Bravd, Bruder; Bul, Bucla, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULLE\">Bulle</a>; and the same agreement is found in almost all other instances of German words that are detected in the Irish language.\n\nThe much disputed question, respecting the antiquity of the poems attributed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>, has an immediate reference to the history of the Celtic languages. It has been observed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, by Professor Adelung, who is not in general sceptical on such occasions, that if these poems were really very ancient, their language could not but exhibit marks of antiquity; there is an Irish Leabhar Lecan, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, written in the thirteenth century, and scarcely intelligible to the best Irish scholars of the present day; the oldest Gaelic manuscripts have also peculiar expressions no longer in use; while the works, supposed to be the productions of a period so much more remote, are found to be in \"excellent modern Gaelic, impressed with all the marks of the language of Christianity, and of that of the Norwegian invaders, whether these conquerors may be supposed to have influenced the Gaelic language immediately in Scotland, or by the intervention of Ireland.\" It must not, however, be forgotten that these marks of Scandinavian intercourse are somewhat more ambiguous than Professor Adelung is disposed to admit; and that a book written in the thirteenth century is more likely to have preserved the language in an antiquated form, than poems so marvellously committed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> from continual recitation only, by people supposed to understand them, and of course imperceptibly modifying the expressions without intending to alter them. But since an invasion from Lochlin, that is, Denmark or Norway, is actually mentioned in \"Fingal,\" the author of the poem could certainly not have been older than the seventh or eighth century, if we are to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> the historical accounts of these invasions; and since in the poems discovered by Dr Matthew Young, St Patrick is introduced discoursing with Ossian respecting the Christian religion, we have an additional argument for denying that he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARACALLA\">Caracalla</a> or Carausius; these Emperors having both lived in the third century, and St Patrick in the fifth.\n\n14. The ETRUSCAN is only known as the immediate parent of the Latin, but it was written in a character totally different, and was read from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to left. Notwithstanding the industry and ingenuity of Lanzi, the evidence of the accuracy of his interpretations is somewhat imperfect. We should naturally have expected to find more words of a Celtic or Gothic origin, and not merely Greek or Latin words, with the terminations a little varied, as Ustite for Ustria, Tribu for Trilus, and Urti or Urtia for Heorti; still less should we have expected that the same sense should be expressed sometimes by a Greek, and sometimes by a Latin word, as Urtu and Punii for Bread, Capros and Feres for a Boar. The Etrurians and Umbrians were originally a branch of the Celts, from Rhaetia, as is shown by the similarity of the names of places in those countries, as well as by the remains of Etruscan art found in that part of the Tyrol; they are supposed to have entered Italy through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, about the year 1000 B.C., and to have afterwards improved their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and workmanship under the auspices of Demaratus of Corinth, who settled in Etruria about 660 B.C.\n\n15. The LATIN language is placed at the head of a family, rather with regard to the number of its descendants, than to the independence of its origin, being too evidently derived from the Celtic, mixed with Greek, to require particular comparison. The first inhabitants of Italy appear to have been Illyrians or Thracians, Cantabrians, Celts, Pelasgians, and Etrurians. Rome, from its situation, would naturally acquire much of the languages of these various nations, and at the same time much of the Greek from the colonies in the south of Italy. In the time of Cicero, the Italian songs, supposed to be about 500 years old, were no longer intelligible, even to those who sang them. We find, in an inscription still more ancient, and approaching to the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMULUS\">Romulus</a>, Lases for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LARES\">Lares</a>; and for Flores, Pleores, which is somewhat nearer to the Celtic Bleun; in the time of Numa, for Hominem liberum, we have Hemomen lebesom; we find, also, a d added to the oblique cases, as Capited for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITE\">Capite</a>, which, as well as the termination Al, in the genitive aulai, pennai, is taken immediately from the Celtic, and is even found in modern Gaelic.\n\nThe Latin remained in perfection but a few centuries; in the middle ages, a number of barbarous words were added to it, principally of Celtic origin, which are found in the glossaries of Dufresne and Charpentier. At the end of the seventh century, it\nbegan to acquire the character of Italian, as Campo divisum est; and, in the eighth century, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, we find, as an example of its incipient conversion into Spanish, Vendant sine pecho, de nostras terras. The formation of the Italian language may be said to have been completed by Dante, in the beginning of the fourteenth century; and it was still further polished by the classical authors who immediately succeeded him. It contains many German words, derived from the different nations who occupied in succession the northern parts of Italy, and some Arabic, Norman, and Spanish, left by occasional visitors in the south. It is spoken by the common people in very different degrees of purity. Among the northern dialects, that of Friuli is mixed with French, and with some Slavonian. The Sicilians, having been conquered in succession by the Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Germans, French, and Spaniards, have retained something of the language of each. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a> has given shelter to Iberians, Libyans, Tyrrhenes, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Goths, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a>, Franks, Arabs, Pisans, and Arragonians; and the proper Sardinian language is a mixture of Latin with Greek, French, German, and Castilian. Corsica has also been occupied by a similar diversity of nations; its peculiar idiom is little known; but the dialect of the upper classes is said to approach nearly to the Tuscan.\n\nSpain, after its complete subjugation by the Romans, enjoyed some centuries of tranquillity. The Vandals and Alans retained their power in Spain but for a short time; the Suevi, on the north coast, somewhat longer; and, from these nations, the rustic Roman, which had become general in Spain, received some words of German origin; it derived, however, much more from the Arabic, during the domination of the Moors, which lasted from the beginning of the eighth century to the end of the fifteenth; and, at one time, the Arabic was almost universally employed throughout the country, except in the churches. The Spanish language advanced the most rapidly toward perfection during the height of the national prosperity, which immediately followed the conquest of America; it was afterwards neglected, and again more particularly cultivated by the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, in the eighteenth century; as far, at least, as an Academy can be supposed to have any influence in the modifications of a language.\n\nThe Portuguese is supposed to have received a mixture of French from the followers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Henry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, under whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> first formed a separate state, in 1109; but the language is very different from that of the confines of France and Spain; and the nasal vowels, which are remarkable in the Portuguese, differ materially from those of the French, or of any other nation. Many Latin words are retained in the Portuguese, which are not found in any other modern language; and it is remarkable that almost all the words of the language are contracted, by the omission of some of the radical letters of the originals.\n\nThe Rhaetians, in the country of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRISONS\">Grisons</a>, were subdued by the Romans in the time of Augustus. They became part of the Alemannish kingdom, under Theodobert, in 539; their union with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> took place in the beginning of the fourteenth century. Half of the Grisons speak the Romanish language, immediately derived from the Latin, though mixed with some German, which has been particularly made known by Mr Planta's account of it, in the Philosophical Transactions. One third speak German, with some mixture of Romanish words, and the rest a bad Italian.\n\nFrance, in the time of the Romans, was occupied by the Gauls, together with the Aquitanians, who were probably Cantabrians, and the Cimbrians or Belgians. From the rustic Roman, mixed with the languages of these nations, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMANCE\">Romance</a> was gradually formed. In the fifth century, the Franks took possession of the north-eastern part of the country; they retained their language for some centuries, but by degrees it became mixed with the Romance, and formed French, of which at least one fifth is supposed to be of German origin; though many of the German words seem to have been admitted through the medium of the Italian. In the south of France, the language remained more exempt from the influence of the German, under the name of the Proven\u00e7al; and the troubadours contributed, especially from the eleventh to the thirteenth century, to give it refinement and currency; but, in later times, the Langue d'oc, which is now spoken by a few of the lowest class only.\n\nThe last and least genuine of the descendants of the Latin is the Wallachian, about one half of which is borrowed from the German, Slavonian, and Turkish. The original Thracians of the country must have been in a great measure superseded by the successive settlements of various nations; in the third century, some of the Goths and Vandals; in the fourth, the Jazyges, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTILA\">Attila</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; in the fifth, some Huns and Alans; about the end of the seventh, the Bulgarians, and afterwards the Petschenergs and Hungarians established themselves in it; and, in the thirteenth century, Wallachia became an independent state. The Latin part of this language has much of the Italian form, and had even assumed it as early as the fifth century. It must have been derived from Roman colonies, and more lately, perhaps, from the missionaries sent into the country by Pope Gregory XI. The Dacian or Hungarian dialect prevails on the north of the Danube; the Thracian, or Cutzowallachian, on the south; the latter is more mixed with Greek and Albanian. There is also a small Wallachian colony in Transylvania.\n\nThe Cantabrian or Biscayan has many words in common with the Latin, whether originally or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>, and was probably in some measure connected with the Celtic dialects, which were the immediate predecessors of the Latin, though still sufficiently distinct from them. The Cantabrian Aita, Father, has some resemblance to the Irish Ailair, and the Moesogothic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTA\">Alta</a>; Seru is not wholly unlike Coelum; Ereenjaa, Regnum; and Borondatia, Voluntas; the coincidence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">Gun</a>, Day, with the Tartarian, is perhaps more accidental. But the word Lurre, Earth, which seems at first sight so unlike any\nLanguages other language, is in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the derivative of Tellure; and this form of the word affords, also, a connecting link with the Irish Talu, and may have been contracted into the more common Latin word Terra; a supposition which seems to lessen the probability of the original connection of this form of the word with the Greek Era, and the Sanscrit Stira.\n\nThe Biscayan is still spoken in the angles of France and Spain, adjoining to the northern extremity of the Pyrenees. The same people were called Cantabrians in the north, and Iberians in the south, and extended between the Pyrenees and the Rhine, as Ligurians, or inhabitants of the coast. They have adopted a few German words, perhaps from the empire of the west Goths; and they have furnished the modern Spanish with more than a hundred original words of their own. The construction of the language is extremely intricate; its verbs have eleven moods, among which are a consuetudinary, a voluntary, a compulsory, and a penitudinary. Larramendi's Grammar, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMANCA\">Salamanca</a> in 1729, is called El Impossible Vencido. A valuable abstract of the most interesting particulars relating to the language is found in the Additions to the Mithridates, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> William von Humboldt, late Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">Ambassador</a> to the Court of Great Britain, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, 1816. Dr Young has lately remarked, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819, that at least six of the words contained in Humboldt's vocabulary coincide very accurately with the Coptic, or ancient Egyptian, though they are not found in any of the languages of the neighbouring countries; and he infers that the chances are \"more than a thousand to one, that, at some very remote period, an Egyptian colony established itself in Spain.\" It may be observed, that one of these words, guchii, little, appears to be also Turkish or Tartarian; so that it becomes a second instance of a coincidence between this language and the Cantabrian.\n\n16. The connexion of the Slavonian and Lithuanian, and of the other branches constituting the Sclavic family, with the languages of the Indo-European class in general, is sufficiently established, without exceeding the limits of the Lord's Prayer, by the resemblance of Nebi or Nebest to the Cimbric Nefoedd, and the Greek Nephos, and of Wolfa and Chljeb to the Gothic Wilja and Hlaif. The Slavonians are the descendants of the ancient Sarmatians, who were situated north of the Black Sea and of the Danube. They were conquered by the Goths, and then driven by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a> and Huns into the northeast of Germany, and the neighbouring countries. Procopius calls them Spori, and divides them into the Selavi and the Antes, the latter, perhaps, the same as the Wends. They formed, at an early period, two principal states, Great Russia, about Novgorod, and Little Russia, on the Dnieper, its capital being Kiew. The Russi were a Scandinavian branch, under Rurik, to whom the Slavonians of the former state submitted in 862, whence they were called Russians; and Rurik's successor, Oleg, conquered Kiew. After several vicissitudes, the Russians were liberated by Iwan Wasiliewitch, at the end of the fifteenth century; and this period was the beginning of their greatness. Their language has some mixture of Greek, Finnish, Swedish, Tartarian, and Mongol. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> dialect was uniformly retained in all literary works, in the former part of the last century, but now the language of conversation is generally adopted in writing. This language is more immediately derived from that of Great Russia; that of the church, which is called the Slavish, rather from Little Russia, and especially from the dialect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVIA\">Servia</a>. The Malorussian dialect is somewhat mixed with the Polish, and is spoken in Ukrain and Little Russia; the Sudalian is mixed with Greek and other languages, and is spoken in Thrace.\n\nIn 640, the Slavonians took possession of Illyria, which before that time had been overrun by a variety of other nations, and they still retain it, under the names of Servians, Croatians, and Southern Wends. The Servians are supposed to have come from Great Servia, now East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALICIA\">Galicia</a>, on the Upper Visula; the Croatians from Great Chrobata, probably situated on the Carpathian mountains. Cyril first adapted the Greek alphabet to the Slavonian language in Pannonia; his letters were afterwards a little altered, and attributed to St Jerom, in order to reconcile the people to their use, and in this form they are termed Glagolitic characters. The Servian dialect is intermediate between the Russian and the Croatian. The Bulgarians speak a corrupt Slavonian, which Bosovich, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAGUSA\">Ragusa</a>, could scarcely understand. The Uskoks are a wild race of the Bulgarians extending into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIOLA\">Carniola</a>, and speaking a mixed language. The dialect of Slavonia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a> is nearly the same as that of Servia and Bosnia; the churches use the ecclesiastical language of Russia. In Ragusa, the orthography approaches, in some measure, to the Italian. The Servian is also imperfectly spoken by a small colony in Transylvania. The southern Wends were first distinguished in 630, and were probably so named, like the Veneti, from being settled on the shores of the Adriatic, the word Wend or Wand meaning Sea. They are now mixed with Germans in Carniola, Carinthia, and Lower Stiria. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, there is a small colony, who call themselves Slovens, and speak the Wendish dialect of the Slavonian. The western Slavonians, or the proper Slavi, write their language in the Roman characters; but the specimens, copied from Adelung, are accommodated in their orthography to the German mode of pronunciation.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">Poles</a> probably came with the Russians from the Danube into the countries abandoned by the Goths; the name Pole implies an inhabitant of plains. Their language was partly superseded by the Latin in the tenth century, when they received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of the Latin church; but it has in later times been more cultivated. The Cassubians, or Kashubians, in Pomerania, spake a Polish mixed with a little German. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a>, the names of places in the plains are Slavonian; in the hills, more lately occupied, German; but German has been the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRESLAU\">Breslau</a> ever since the year 1800.\n\nThe Bohemians emigrated, with the Moravians and Slovaks, into their present habitations, about the middle of the sixth century, after the destruc-\ntion of the kingdom of Thuringia by the Franks and Saxons. There is a Bohemian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYMN\">hymn</a> of the date 990, and a chronicle in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a>, of 1310. One third of the Bohemians are of German origin, and speak a corrupt German.\n\nThe Serbs, or Wends, came about the same time into the countries between the Saal and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODER\">Oder</a>, from the neighbourhood of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLGA\">Volga</a> or the Crimea; a few of them are still left in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUSATIA\">Lusatia</a>, under the name of Wends or Slavonians, and some in Misnia. In Pomerania the Wendish became extinct about 1400; but the Polabes in L\u00fcneburg, on the Leyne, kept up till lately a language consisting of a mixture of Wendish and German. The Sorabie of the Russian vocabulary seems to be the same with this Serbian.\n\nOf the Lithuanian or Lettish language, two thirds are Slavonian, the rest is principally German. When the Goths had removed from the Baltic towards the Black Sea, their neighbours the Aestii remained for some hundred years independent, till in the sixth century the Slavonians incorporated themselves with them, and formed the Lettish people and language. The Old Prussian was spoken, at the time of the Reformation, in Samland and its neighbourhood, but it is now lost; it contained more German than the other Lithuanian dialects. The Prussian Lithuanian is spoken from the Inster to Memel, especially in Insterburg. The Polish Lithuanian, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOGITIA\">Samogitia</a>, has a little mixture of Polish. The proper Lettish is current in Lettland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURLAND\">Courland</a>; it is purest about Mittau and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGA\">Riga</a>; the old Courlanders having been Fins, this dialect has received a little Finnish from them. The Crievingian is another dialect, spoken by the Krewins in Courland.\n\n17. The Tshudish or Finnish, the Hungarian, and the Albanian languages, have some traits of resemblance to each other; they are placed as forming the Sporadic or scattered order of the great Tartaric or Asiatic class, being in some measure geographically detached from the rest, and scattered through different parts of Europe: they immediately follow the Indoeuropean class, as exhibiting an occasional resemblance to some of the languages contained in it, though not enough to make it certain that the connexion is essential or original; thus the Finnish is said to have some coincidences with the Greek, the Laplandish with the Hebrew, the Hungarian with the Finnish, and the Albanian with all its neighbours.\n\nThe term Tshudish is employed as comprehending the Fins, Laplanders, Esthonians, and Livonians; a race of people of unknown origin; but in all probability unconnected with the Huns or Mongols. Their languages are remarkable for the great complexity of their structure; their nouns, for example, having from ten to fifteen cases, among which are reckoned, in the Finnish, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUNCUPATIVE\">nuncupative</a>, a conditional, accusative, a factitive, a mediative, a descriptive, a penetrative, a locative, a privative, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. The Esthonian has less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> variety of termination, but several intricate combinations. There is also a great multiplicity of dialects, partly from a mixture of Scandinavian, and partly from other causes; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a> almost every church has a peculiar version of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> kept for its use. The Finnish is intermediate between the Laplandish and the Esthonian. The Esthonian are the Aestii of the Romans, the name implying Easterly, and being appropriate to the country, and not to the people. The principal dialects of their language are those of Reval and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORPAT\">Dorpat</a>; some authors also consider the dialect of the Krewins in Courland as belonging to it. The Livonian is much mixed with other languages, and has been almost superseded by the Lettish. Among the Laplandish words, which Rudbeck has derived from the Hebrew, we find Aedhame, Earth, like the Hebrew Adamach; Hadas, New, H. Khadesh; Hadshe, the Moon, H. Hhadesh; Jed, the Hand, H. Id; Ise, Man, H. Ish; Pothi, persuaded, H. Pathekh; Saecke, law, H. Tzedek; and Safothi, rested, H. Sabbath. In the Finnish, Kana is something like the English and German Hen.\n\n18. The Hungarians inhabited in the fourth century the country of the Bashkirs, between the Tobol, the Volga, and the Jaik, perhaps as colonists, since their name signifies strangers; their language was spoken in this neighbourhood as late as the thirteenth century; in the sixth they were conquered by some of their Turkish neighbours; in the end of the ninth they were forced by the Petschenegers, a Tartarian nation, to remove nearer to the Carpathian mountains. They were then engaged in the German wars, and their country having been occupied during their absence by the Bulgarians, they took possession of the Bulgarian kingdom on the Theiss, as well as of Pannonia. Their language is somewhat like the Finnish, but the people are very different from the Fins in appearance; which might indeed be the effect of a difference of climate; but in fact the language appears to be still more like the Slavonian, with a mixture of a multitude of others; it has some words from various Tartarian dialects, German, French, Latin, Armenian, Hebrew, Persian, and Arabic; but it has no traces of the Mongol, nor is it possible that the people can be descendants of the Huns, whose character and cast of features can never be eradicated. The word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">Coach</a>, so general in Europe, is originally Hungarian, having been derived from the town of Ko\u00ebs, where coaches are said to have been invented. The Szeklers, in Transylvania, speak a language like the Hungarian; it is uncertain whether they are a Hungarian colony, or remains of the Petschenegers; but, however this may be, there is little doubt that the Hungarians are principally of Tartarian extraction, though much mixed with other nations.\n\n19. The Albanians speak a language, of which a considerable portion is Greek, Latin, German, Slavonian, or Turkish; but the rest seems to be perfectly distinct from any other language with which we are acquainted. They are probably connected with the Albanians between Mount Caucasus and the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a>, who are supposed to be derived from the Alanis; some of them seem to have entered Bulgaria as late as 1303. In 1461, many of them fled from the Turks to Italy and Sicily, where they still exist near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGGIO\">Reggio</a> and Messina. The Clemen-\ntines are an Albanian colony, who followed the Austrian army in 1737; such of them as escaped from the pursuit of the Turks established themselves in Syria.\n\n20. The languages referred to the Caucasian order have little to distinguish them from the rest of the class, except their geographical situation, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Caucasian mountains. They have a general resemblance to some others of the languages of Northern Asia, and particularly to the Samogedic dialects, spoken on the mountains between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> and the Mongols. Except the Armenian and Georgian, they are scarcely ever employed in writing; and principally, perhaps, from this cause, they exhibit as great a diversity in the space of a few square miles, as those of many other nations do in as many thousands. It is only conjectured that most of the inhabitants of these countries are derived from the miscellaneous fragments of expeditions of various nations, left behind in their passage through them at different periods.\n\nThe connexion of the Armenian with the Sanscrit and the Persian is just enough to make it equally possible, that the coincidences may have been derived from a common parent, or that one language may have simply borrowed detached words from the other. We find, in different parts of Mr Townsend's work, about ten Armenian words resembling some other language; these are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">Air</a>, a man, Air, Irish; Ataman, a tooth, Odonta, Greek; Chuerk, four; Chatuer, Sanscrit; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOR\">Dor</a>, a Door; E, is Est, Latin; Es, I, Jaze, Russian; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">Gas</a>, a Goose, Gans, German; House, a House; Lakel, to lick, Leichen, Greek; and Sirt, the Heart. Nothing is known of the history of the Armenian before the time of Miesrob, who translated the Bible into it, in 405; the historian Moses, of Chorene, was his pupil. The language flourished till the year 800, and is still preserved in tolerable purity, in the cloisters. The common people speak a dialect more corrupt and mixed. The Fathers of the Armenian convent at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> have been very laudably employed in the improvement of the literature of their nation, by the publication of several very elegant editions of Armenian books, which have been executed at their press; in particular, of an Armenian translation of Eusebius, containing some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> which are not extant in Greek, and said to have been copied from a manuscript of great antiquity at Constantinople; it is, however, very remarkable, that, as they candidly confess, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, when first received by them, contained the corrections and additions of Scaliger, in conformity with the text of the printed Greek edition, and the copyist, when questioned, asserted that he had merely translated and inserted passages of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, and in silence, in order to make the work more perfect. Still the Armenian Eusebius is a very handsome book, and every way calculated to do credit to the Venetian editors and their patrons; a Latin translation of it only has been published by Angelo Mai at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>.\n\n21. The Georgians are supposed to have derived their name from the river Cyrus or Gur, and to have extended formerly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCHIS\">Colchis</a>, under the denomination of Iberians. Moses of Chorene, in the fifth century, mentions the Georgian translation of the Bible. The old language is still preserved in the churches, and the common dialect of the country is derived from it, together with the Kartvelish, Imrettish, Mingrelish, and Swanetish, which are varieties of that dialect; the Tusketish is mixed with some Kistic. The Georgians have no fewer than thirty seven letters, and among them a variety of aspirates and sibilants, of no very agreeable sounds.\n\n22. The Abassic nations seem to be the oldest inhabitants of the Caucasian country; (23.) the Circassians are situated to the east of them, on the promontory of North Caucasus; (24.) the Ossetes, on the left of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEREK\">Terek</a>, north of the mountain; the dialect of the Dagors is scarcely distinguishable from this: (25.) the Kistic, spoken by the Ingushans, and their neighbours, at the head of the Terek, is connected with the Tushtic Georgian.\n\n26. The Lesgians, east of Caucasus, on the Caspian Sea, have a number of distinct dialects, or rather languages; thus, the Chunsag, and Avaric, the Dido, the Kasi Kumik, the Andi, and the Akushan, have little connexion with each other, except that the Dido somewhat resembles the Chunsag, of which the Avaric, the Antag, and the Dzhar, seem to be subordinate dialects. The Kasi Kumik appears to have adopted some words of the Armenian, and the Andi and Akushan of the Georgian. The dialect of Kubesh resembles that of Akusha, and retains no traces of a supposed European origin.\n\n27. The languages of the central and elevated parts of Asia are comprehended in the order Tartarian; they extend from the Caspian Sea to the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AMUR\">Amur</a>, through countries which have been, in former ages, the constant scenes of emigration and barbarism. The Turcotartarians are supposed to correspond to the descendants of the Magog of the Scriptures, and to some of the Scythians of the Greeks. The Turks of Turkestan seem to have been the Massagetae and Chorasmii of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; their country extended North of Persia and Tibet, from the Caspian to the Altaic mountains. In the twelfth century, they were brilliant and victorious; at present, a few of their descendants only are left in the neighbourhood of the Mongols, and their language is no longer spoken; the Turcomans, scattered in Persia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, are derived from the same race. The Osmans, now commonly called Turks, left Turkestan in 545, and succeeded in the conquest of Persia. They were denominated Osmans, from one of their leaders, in the fourteenth century; their language has been much mixed with Arabic and Persian. This language, with the neighbouring dialects, has been considered in the table as belonging to a family called Caspian, the word Tartarian having been previously applied to the whole order; several of these dialects exhibit a mixture of words from the language of the Mongols, which, as well as the Calmuk, has a sufficient connexion with them to be arranged as belonging to the same Turcotartarian family: it would, perhaps, be equally correct to consider some of them rather as distinct languages than as dialects of a single one; but it is not easy to discriminate those which are entitled to this rank; and, on the other hand, some specimens have been admitted, from the Comparative Voca-\nLanguages, which scarcely deserved to be noticed as separate dialects. The Bucharians are situated between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXUS\">Oxus</a> and Jaxartes, on the river Koly; they still retain some traces of a superior degree of civilization, by which they were once distinguished; their language is little known, but it seems to be at least as much connected with the Median and Arabian families as with the Caspian. The Tartars were described by the terms Scythians, Bulgarians, Avari, and other appellations, before they were conquered and united by Genghizkhan the Mongol; in the year 1552, they became subject to the Russians. The most westerly are, the Nogaic or Nagaic, and Crimean Tartars; their language is much like the Turkish, but mixed with some Mongol. Those of Cumania in Hungary have now forgotten their original language, and speak the Hungarian; the last person who understood the Cumanian having died in 1770; they entered Hungary in 1086, and became Christians in 1410. The Tartarian, or rather Caspian, is spoken in great purity about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KASAN\">Kasan</a>; a dialect somewhat different in Orenburg; and another by the Kirgishes, who occupy part of the ancient Turkestan. \"Among the Siberian Tartars, the remains of the kingdom of Turan, some are Mahomethans; others, as the Turalinzie villagers, have been made Christians; at least, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> Philophei performed the ceremony of baptizing them, by ordering his dragoons to drive them in a body into the river.\" The inhabitants of the banks of the Tara, a branch of the Irish, are said to be derived from the Bucharians. The Tshulimic Tartars enjoy the same advantage as the Turalinzie, and are considered as Christians by the Russians. The Teleutes, in Sonjor, are heathens, nearly like the Shamanites of India. The Jakuts extend along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENA\">Lena</a> to the sea; their language contains some Mantshuric and some Tungusic; that of the Tshuwashes, on the Volga, is said to have been once completely distinct from the Tartarian or Caspian, and even at present, though more mixed with it, may require to be classed as forming a separate species.\n\nThe Mongols are marked by their features as a race very different from the other Tartars; the character of their countenance seems to be easily propagated from father to son, and never to be completely effaced; their original habitation appears to have been in the neighbourhood of the Altai mountains. The description of the Huns, found in Ammian, Procopius, and others, agrees exactly with the present Mongols, whom the Chinese still call Kiong nu; and more particularly with the Calmucks: the proper names of the Huns are also found to be explicable from the Mongol language. In the first century they were driven westwards by the Chinese: under Attila they penetrated into the middle of Europe; and they were little less successful at subsequent periods, under Genghizkhan and Timur Leng. When they were expelled from China, after having held it in subjection for more than a century, they carried back no civilization with them; nor was either of the languages permanently affected by this temporary mixture of the nations, although the physiognomy of the Chinese bears ample testimony of its having once existed. The construction of their language seems to be very indirect and figurative. Mr Townsend has copied from General Vallancy a long list of words, in Strahlenberg's Mongol Vocabulary, which agree very remarkably with the Irish; among these we find Are and Ere, man, Irish Ar, Air, Fear; Arul, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>, Irish Oirle; Alemamodo, an apple tree, Irish Amhaluhaide; Asoc, to ask, Irish Ascadh; Baichu, I live long, Irish Baich, long life; Bugu, a buck, Irish Boc, a he goat; Chay a ewe, Irish Choi; and Choraga a lamb, Irish Caorog; without going any further in the alphabet. The last two instances are very striking, and seem to point very strongly at the part of the east from which the Celts may be supposed to have originally emigrated. The Calmuck dialect is somewhat mixed with the neighbouring Tartarian. The Tagurians, or Daurians, between the lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAIKAL\">Baikal</a> and the Mongol hills, are said to be of Mantshuric origin; but their language evidently resembles the Calmuck. The Burattish is from the Russian Vocabularies.\n\n28. The Mantshurians are sometimes improperly called Eastern Mongols; they are subjects of the empire of China. Their language is rude, and not much like the Chinese, though evidently derived from the monosyllabic class; it has some few words in common with the European languages, as Kiri, patient; Kirre, German, Cicar, Latia, tame; Furu, Furor; Lapta, rags, Lappen, German; Sengui, blood, Sanguis; Ania, a year, Annus; but considering the remoteness of their situation, we can scarcely form any conclusion from the occurrence of these resemblances. Mr R\u00e9musat has lately been appointed Professor of this language at Paris; but it will probably be difficult for him to render its study very popular in the midst of so busy a metropolis. Whether the language of the island of Sagalica, opposite to the mouth of the Amur, is a dialect of the Mantshuric, or totally distinct, and requiring to be classified with the insular languages, appears to be not yet sufficiently ascertained. The Corean has been supposed to be a mixture of Mantshuric and Chinese: the Coreans do not understand either of those languages when they are spoken; but this fact is perfectly compatible with the supposition.\n\n29. The Tungusians, in the east of Siberia, subject to the Chinese, speak a peculiar language, mixed with some Mongol; the Russian Vocabularies contain specimens of a variety of their dialects, besides those of the Tshapogirs on the Jenisei, and the Lamutii on the sea of Ochotsk, none of them particularly interesting or remarkable.\n\n30. The languages belonging to the Siberian order occupy the principal part of the north of Asia between the mountainous Tartarian territory and the Frozen Sea. At the commencement of this order, we find a variety of inconsiderable nations in the neighbourhood of the confines of Europe and Asia, which have their distinct languages, probably formed in times comparatively modern, out of the fragments of others. They have almost all of them some Finnish words, but none a sufficient number to justify us in considering them as dialects of the Finnish language, although the people were very probably connected with the Fins, as neighbours, in the middle ages, on the banks of the Dwina and\nThe Sirjanes, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Archangel, speak nearly the same language with the Permians, who are partly in the same government, and partly in that of Kasan. The Wotiahs, on the Wiatka, also in Kasan, have a dialect which seems to be intermediate between the Permin and the Tsheremissic. 31. The Wogulis, situated on the Kama and the Irtish, afford specimens of several dialects in the Russian collection; they seem to have borrowed a few words from the Hungarian, and much more from the language of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSTIAKS\">Ostiaks</a> (32), who are also divided into several races. 33. The Tsheremisses, situated on the Volga, in Kasan, have a little mixture of Turcotartarian. 34. The Morduins, on the Oka and Volga, have about one eighth of their language Finnish, and also some Turcotartarian words: the Mohtanic is a dialect differing but slightly from the Morduin. 35. The Teptjerai are people paying no taxes, who originated from the relics of the Tartarokasanic kingdom in the sixteenth century, and who are said to speak a language peculiar to themselves. The arrangement of all these dialects must remain very imperfect; for want of a greater number of specimens of their peculiarities.\n\n36. The Samojedic nations are situated north of the Tartars, by whom they may possibly have been driven into their present habitations. Their languages seem to have some affinity with the Caucasian and Lesgian dialects, and some of them with the Wogulic and Ostiak families; the specimens in the Comparative Vocabularies seem to have been multiplied somewhat too liberally. 37. The Camashes are situated on the right of the Jenisei; they are Shamanites or Buddhists; their language seems to be a mixture of several others, and is divided into several very distinct dialects. The Koibals have been baptized; they have borrowed some words from the Turcotartarian family. The Motors are situated on the Tuba. 38. The Ostiaks on the river Jenisei afford us five specimens of languages totally different from those of the Ostiaks already mentioned, but nearly connected with each other, so that they may properly be called Jenisciostiaks. 39. The Jukagirs or Jakudshirs are few in number; they are situated between the Jakuti and the Tshutshic; they have some Jakutish words mixed with their language, and some Tsheremissic. 40. The Koriahs and the Tshutshic occupy the north-easternmost point of Siberia; the proper Koriak is spoken on the bay of Penshin; the Kolymic on the river Kolyma, the Tigilic on the Tigil in Kamtchatka, and the Karaginian on the island Karaga; the Tshutshic has been considered as a dialect of the Koriah. 41. The Kamtchatkans are a little further south; the Tigilic Kamtchatkan is found, however, on the north of the Tigil; the Srednisk to the west, on the Bolshaia, and the Jozhnyshic on the river Kamtchatka, and towards the South Cape. The languages of the neighbouring parts of America, according to Professor Vater, greatly resemble the Tshutshic.\n\nThe Insular order of the Tataric or Atactic class of languages must be understood as comprehending all the Asiatic islands east of Borneo. 42. The language of the Carilees is spoken not only in the principal of these islands, but also in Kamtchatka, about Cape Lopatka; but in some of the islands the Japanese is spoken. The Japanese derive themselves from the Chinese; but their language contradicts this opinion; they have evident traces of Mongol extraction or relationship. The amiable islanders of Levchen will long be remembered by the British public for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> they showed to the Alceste and the Lyra; their language appears to be related to the Japanese, as might be expected from their situation. Formosa was conquered by the Dutch in 1620, but in 1661 it was taken from them by a Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRATE\">pirate</a>: the next year some books were printed in the Formosan language in Holland; the recapture of the island not being yet known there; in 1682, it was finally given up to the Chinese government. 47. The Moluccan is considered by Dr Leyden as an original language; that of Magindanao contains some Malayan, Moluccan, Tagalish, and Bugis. The Tagalish or Gala is the principal language of the Philippines, and almost as generally understood in that neighbourhood as the Malay and Hindustance in other parts; it is allied to the Malayan and to the Javanese, and was probably derived in great measure from these languages; it also resembles in some measure the Bugis. The Bisayish is a ruder dialect of the Tagalish. The Sulu differs but little from these dialects, being derived from the same sources. The Bugis is the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELEBES\">Celebes</a>; it is supposed to be more ancient than the Javanese; it seems to contain no Sanscrit, but much Malay, Tagalish, and Javanese, and some of the old Ternate or Moluccan; it is written in a peculiar character, and some good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> is found in it; there is a dialect called the Mungharar. The Bima somewhat resembles this dialect; it is spoken in the eastern parts of Sumbawa, and the western of Ende or Flores; it is written either in the Bugis or the Malay character; it seems to have a distant resemblance to the language of Orissa: the dialect of Sumbawa exhibits some slight variations. A few single words, as Matla, the eye, and Matle, death, are found to coincide in almost all the islands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>; the languages of which, notwithstanding their immense distances, seem to differ less than those of the inhabitants of some very small continental tracts; and they might probably be divided into a few well defined families, if our knowledge of them were more complete. The resemblance of Matle to the Arabian Mot, and the Latin Macare, is probably accidental.\n\nThe number of the African languages is supposed to amount to 100 or 150, and as many as 70 or 80 of them have been distinguished with tolerable accuracy. The population of Africa seems to have been derived from Arabia, and, as some critics think, rather from the southern than from the northern parts; a great number of its present inhabitants are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGROS\">negros</a>, but these cannot be distinguished from the rest by any infallible criterion. The account given by Ptolemy of the interior part of the country appears to be wonderfully accurate and extensive; although some of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> seem to be erroneous, and not sufficiently reconcileable with the truth, even by adopting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> respecting them. It is however remarkable that Pto-\nLemys followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a> in extending the eastern coast of Africa to the Ganges; although more correct ideas of its form had been entertained at Alexandria before his time.\n\nThe Egyptians demand the priority, in treating of the inhabitants of Africa, from their early connexion with ancient history, both sacred and profane. It is observable that the representations of the old Egyptians have countenances more or less approaching to the negro physiognomy, though the dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of the skeleton have that character somewhat less decidedly than they must have had when clothed with the thick lips and flattish noses of the generality of the representations; at the same time there are sculptures of great antiquity, which exhibit features not unlike those of correct Grecian or Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; and others have a considerable resemblance to the Arabian nation; at present the people of middle Africa, in general, are more or less like negros, but they are somewhat less dark, and their noses and lips are less peculiar; the women sometimes screamed if Burckhardt made his appearance on a sudden, and called him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a>, because he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>.\n\nThe Egyptians are supposed by some writers to have received their civilization from Ethiopia; but there are at present no traces of the remains of high civilization further south than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>, except a few scattered monuments about Axum, of no great antiquity. The Egyptians were first called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPTS\">Copts</a> by the Saracens, and their language has been commonly distinguished by the appellation Coptic, that is, as written in characters which are principally Greek, and frequently intermixed with a number of pure Greek words; but not a single fragment of Coptic has yet been discovered in this form, that is earlier than the establishment of Christianity in Egypt; and it seems probable that the character was introduced by the early Christians at the time of the translation of the Scriptures into Coptic, which is certainly of very high antiquity. The Greek authors frequently mention an Egyptian alphabet of twenty-five letters; but no traces of any such alphabet is found in the multitudinous inscriptions or manuscripts that have been preserved by the exertions of the numerous and adventurous travellers who have lately visited the country. (See the article Egypt, of this Supplement.)\n\nThe Greek words mixed with the Coptic are not considered by the grammarians as incorporated with the language, nor are they admitted into the dictionaries. The genuine language bears very evident marks of great antiquity; its construction is simple and often awkward; and a great number of its words are monosyllables. We have positive evidence of its having remained unaltered, from the time of Herodotus, Plutarch, and other Greek authors, and it affords us the etymology of the name of Moses, and of some other words mentioned in the Scriptures. It exhibits a few coincidences with other ancient languages, but not enough to enable us to consider it either as the offspring or the parent of any of them, except that it gives us something like an explanation of the meaning of some of the Greek particles. Out of 114 original Egyptian words, which are enumerated by the Quarterly Reviewer, in his account of Mr. Townsend's work, there are fifty-two that resemble the Greek, twenty-seven the German and English, eighteen the Hebrew, three the Syriac, two the Arabic, two the Sanscrit, one the Sclavonian, and one the Cantabrian. It is, however, probable, that a person more intimately acquainted with the languages of the Arabian family would have been able to find a much greater number of coincidences, since nations, which had so much intercourse as the Jews and the Egyptians, could scarcely fail to have many words in common, even if their languages had been at first completely different; and probably many of the Arabic roots, which are not Hebrew, may be found in the Egyptian. To the Cantabrian word inserted in this enumeration, Dr Young has added five others, in his late essay, already quoted, the whole six being Berria, new; Ora, a dog; Guchi, little; Ogulia, bread; \"Otsoa,\" a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>; whence the Spanish Onza; and Shashpi, seven; in Coptic, Beri, new; Uhors, a dog; Kudshi, little; Oik, bread; Uonsh, a wolf; and Shashpi, seven; whence he infers that \"if we consider these words as sufficiently identical to admit of our calculating upon them, the chances will be more than a thousand to one that, at some very remote period, an Egyptian colony established itself in Spain; for none of the languages of the neighbouring nations retain any traces of having been the medium through which these words have been conveyed. On the other hand,\" he continues, \"if we adopted the opinions of a late learned antiquary,\" General Vallancey, \"the probability would be still incomparably greater, that Ireland was originally peopled from the same mother country; since he has collected more than one hundred words, which are certainly Egyptian, and which he considers as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the same sense in Irish; but the relation, which he has magnified into identity, appears in general to be that of a very faint resemblance; and this is precisely an instance of a case in which it would be deceiving ourselves to attempt to reduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to a calculation.\" It may, indeed, be imagined that the Egyptian dominions may formerly have extended to the Straits of Gibraltar, and that Spain may have derived a part of its population from this part of Africa, which approaches so near to it; but it could scarcely have happened that no traces of Egyptian monuments should ever have been found at any distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, if that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> people had really occupied any considerable portion of the neighbouring continent. The word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, in Greek Chemia, is well known to be derived from the Egyptian; it has successively been compared, by the Quarterly Reviewer, to Chim or Chem, heat; and to Chem, secret; the latter is the more probable origin of the two; and a third etymon might be found, if it were required, in the word Dshem, or Ghem, to find, or Invention. The Coptic language has been nearly extinct for about two centuries; but the service has been read in Coptic much more lately in some of the churches; though it has now been almost entirely superseded by the Arabic. The proper Coptic, or Memphitic, which was the dialect of Lower Egypt, is supposed, from a word quoted by Herodotus, to be the most ancient; the Sahidic or Thebaic of Upper Egypt was probably preserved for a longer time, especially in some of the monasteries;\nthere is a separate version of the principal part of the Bible in this dialect, fragments of which have been published by Mingarelli and Woide; a third dialect, much resembling the Thebaic, is commonly called the Bashmuric, and a fourth, the Oasitic, has been partially made known by Mr Quatremere de Quincy.\n\nThe Egyptians have left no traces of their language among the people who at present occupy the countries that they inhabited; the Nubian vocabularies collected by Burckhardt contain no Coptic words; the people are of different Arab races, but have acquired peculiar dialects, probably mixed with those of the neighbouring negro nations, of several of which we find specimens in Mr Salt's Voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>.\n\nBut one of the most learned, as well as the most adventurous and industrious of modern travellers, has remarked some coincidences between the old Egyptian language and that of the Barabras, who are neighbours of the Nubians, and extend to the confluence of the Tacazz\u00e9 and the Nile. The Geez and Amharic have already been mentioned as descendants of the Arabian family; they seem to have introduced some traces of this extraction into several of the neighbouring dialects, probably by the translations of the Scriptures, or by the use of the Koran.\n\nProfessor Vater has taken some pains to prove that the language of Amhara, the Camara of Agatharchides, is wholly independent of the Ethiopic and Arabian; but in this he appears to be mistaken. It exhibits some slight resemblance to the Sanscrit, in a few instances; thus, Tsh\u00e9gure is hair, in Sanscrit, Tshicura. Macrizi tells us, that there are, in the whole, fifty Abyssinian dialects; but he has probably exaggerated their number. We have obtained more authentic information respecting them from the collections of Bruce, and of his editor, Murray, and still more lately from Dr Seetzen and Mr Salt.\n\nOf the Mek of Dungola, the representative of a long race of the Christian Kings of Nubia, little is now known, except that he is in a great measure dependent on the King of Sennar on the one hand, and has been expelled from a part of his territories by the Mamelukes, on the other. Of the Agows and the Gafats, neighbours of the Abyssinians, and situated on the Bahr el Azrek, as well as the Jewish Falashas, who are scattered over the country, especially in Dembea, we have read much in the historical romances of Mr Bruce, which certainly give a faithful picture of the countries to which they relate, notwithstanding some unaccountable inaccuracies with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> adventures of the author.\n\nThe north of Africa is occupied by inhabitants not much differing in appearance from the Arabs; its three principal divisions are the coast, the country of wild beasts, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>. The later Arabs have expelled the earlier Africans from the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and partly from the second; the Berbers occupy the third, inhabiting principally the Oases, or cultivable islands, scattered through the desert, from Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a> to Egypt, and speaking, as Horneman first ascertained, the same language throughout this vast extent. They were first well described by Leo Africanus; they are probably the remains of the Mauritians, Numidians, Gaetulians, and Garamantians; there is no foundation whatever for the opinion of some modern authors of celebrity, that their language is derived from the Punic; we even find, from Sallust, that the Numidian language differed from the Carthaginian, and from Valerius Maximus, that it was written in a peculiar character, perhaps the same with that which is found in the inscriptions from Lebeda, now in the court of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>. The language of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANARIES\">Canaries</a> considerably resembles the Berber; thus, Milk is Acho in Berber, and Aho in the Canaries. These islands were discovered in 1330, and afterwards conquered, with some difficulty, by the Spaniards; the inhabitants were a fine race of men, and lived in comfort and tranquillity; and they still present some traces of their original character and condition.\n\nThe country between the desert Zaraa and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a> is inhabited by a race of people who have a great resemblance to negros, but are somewhat different from them. In the east are those of Sudan or Afuu, and Begirma; in the west the Fulaks; the Phellatas are a branch of these, extending considerably to the north east, with a mixture of negros.\n\nOf the languages of the negros, strictly so called, many interesting specimens have been collected by the zeal of the evangelical missionaries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARIBBEE_ISLANDS\">Caribbee Islands</a>, and published by Oldendorp, in his Account of the mission; but they do not afford us sufficient materials to enable us to trace any extensive connexions or dependencies among their multifarious dialects.\n\nThere are some points of coincidence between the language of Madagascar and those of the Malays, the Philippine islanders, the Beeljauana Caffres, and the Corana Hottentots; there are also a few words, in many of the African dialects, borrowed from the modern Arabic, not, as Court de Gebelin would persuade us, from the Phoenician: nor can any other of the affinities be very distinctly established.\n\nThe Caffres have little of the negro character, except the black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and less of this as they become more remote from the equator; they are supposed to extend across the whole of Africa, immediately north of the Hottentots, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGUELA\">Benguela</a> and Quiloa. The Hottentots, with their neighbours the Bosjemen, speak different dialects of the same singular language, in different parts of their country. Of that of the Dammaras, little or nothing is known. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LICHTENSTEIN\">Lichtenstein</a> has classed them as Hottentots; but Barrow, who was better acquainted with them, considers them as Caffres.\n\n(Gesner, Mithridates, de Differentiis Linguarum, 8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZURICH\">Zurich</a>, 1555.\u2014Megiser, Specimen XL.

The deaths, the year preceding, were, 1366 males, and 1370 females. The baptisms of the same year were 2034 males, and 2024 females; the marriages, 1206. The number of families was 31,480; those employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> were 11,700; those in trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> 17,027, and those of neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> 2753.\n\nThe towns whose inhabitants exceed 1500 are the following:\n\n| Towns               | Houses | Inhabitants |\n|---------------------|--------|-------------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>           | 4,683  | 23,146      |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HINCKLEY\">Hinckley</a>           | 1,123  | 6,058       |\n| Loughborough       | 1,140  | 5,400       |\n| Ashby-de-la-Zouch  | 647    | 3,141       |\n| Sheepshead         | 547    | 3,026       |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONNINGTON\">Donnington</a> Castle   | 493    | 2,308       |\n| Melton-Mowbray     | 422    | 2,145       |\n| Wigston Magna      | 388    | 1,901       |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUTTERWORTH\">Lutterworth</a>        | 425    | 1,845       |\n| Market Harborough  | 342    | 1,704       |\n| Kegworth           | 313    | 1,550       |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Shilton       | 310    | 1,533       |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOUNT_SORREL\">Mount <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORREL\">Sorrel</a>       | 281    | 1,502       |\n\nThe county of Leicester may be described generally as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> district, whose undulations are very gentle, and exhibiting but few interesting prospects. The exceptions to this remark are the Charnwood Hills, on the northern part of the county, which rise in an insulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and from the summit of which the rest of the county appears extended in a well-wooded but even surface under the feet. The most lofty prominence of this range of hills (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> denominated the Forest, though it is destitute of trees) is Bardonhill, whose top is 850 feet above the level of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. The vale of Belvoir, in which the castle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Rutland stands, displays much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of a soft, rather than a romantic and picturesque character.\n\nNone of the rivers of this county are considerable Rivers and streams, nor any of them calculated for the conveyance of commodities except the Soar, for a short distance, but they are abundant, and contribute to increase the beauty and fertility of the district. Their names are, the Anker, Avon, Blackbrook, Deane, Eye, Scalford, Sence, Saite, Soar, Swift, Trent, Willand, and Wreke. The intercourse of the county, both in its own different districts and with the surrounding parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, is amply provided for by several navigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>. One of these connects the town of Leicester with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Junction Canal, in Northamptonshire; another communicates by Loughborough with the river Trent; another from the coal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, passes by Hinckley, and proceeds into Warwickshire; and one is designed to connect Melton-Mowbray with the centre of Rutlandshire.\n\nThough the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is various, yet, in general, it may be classed under the denominations of either clay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> loam, for there are very few portions of it that are calcareous, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, or gravelly. The best soil is on the hills, and generally the valleys are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> clay, very wet in the winter, and with the turf so tender as scarcely to bear the treading of sheep in that season. The soil is naturally productive of the best and most abundant crops of grass, and better fitted for feeding cattle than for arable culture. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, a very small portion is under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, but those parts produce most excellent wheat, oats, and beans; the latter have great celebrity. There are few open fields now remaining, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of waste <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is very small. The productions of the soil are principally from the sheep and cows. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKEWELL\">Bakewell</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> in improving the breeds of all cattle is generally known, has been the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> this county first, and afterwards many other parts of England, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of sheep produced by various crosses, that by many farmers is now preferred to every other, and universally known by the name of the new Leicesters. They unite perfect symmetry of shape with the smallest possible quantity of bone and offal, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> is both fine and abundant. The horned cattle were, in like manner, improved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> of this skilful breeder; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> part of England exceeds Leicestershire either in its beef or in the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a>. The cheese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STILTON\">Stilton</a> commonly made is in great request through all the Cheese north of England, and the kind called Stilton, from having been first sold in that town, though made near Melton-Mowbray, is perhaps the richest in the world.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of making it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> kept a secret in a few villages, but is now universally known. Its richness arises from one-half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> being skimmed, and the cream taken from that added to the other milk, so that the cheese have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the usual quantity of cream in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. Bakewell improved, also, the breed of horses to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. In this line there was less room for any extraordinary progress; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> horses, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a> kind, originating principally from mares which he brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, enabled him to introduce the method of ploughing with two horses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a>, by which much labour in agriculture is saved.\n\nThe manufacture of most eminence in this county is that of Hosiery, which gives employment more or less constant to two-thirds of its inhabitants. The quantity of stockings made here is prodigious, and supplies the greater part of the British dominions, as well as many other parts of the world, with those of an inferior and middling quality. The first frames were invented about 1590, but the first introduced in Leicestershire was used at Hinckley, in 1640. Since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, many improvements in the machinery of them have been made. At each step in advance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of diminishing the labour has occasioned riots and tumults among the workmen, which have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and recently has embodied them under the denomination of Luddites, to the terror of the peaceful inhabitants, some of whom have transferred their capitals and machinery to less turbulent districts. The only other manufactures of consideration are, an extensive one of cotton-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a>, at Loughborough, and some small ones, of stuffs, at Market Harborough.\n\nIn the north-west part of the county there are extensive mines of valuable coal, which supply the inhabitants of the surrounding districts. With them terminate the mines in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the German Ocean to the southward. At Bredon, on the confines, the singular rock, called Bredon Hill, is composed of a most valuable kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, which forms an excellent cement in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and which was used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the pier of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMSGATE\">Ramsgate</a>.\n\nThe Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> are still visible in many parts of the county, though in many instances they have been covered by the more recent highways. The Watling Street <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, the Fossway, and the Via Davana, traversed the county, and have been traced with great accuracy by antiquarians. At Radcliffe, on the Wreke, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> tumulus, generally attributed to the Celts, 350 feet long, and 120 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. At Leicester, which was a Roman station, are still visible the remains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> of that people, in what is called the Jewney wall, consisting of a mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, brick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and dilapidated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, built in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> courses of brick in three layers, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. Near the town is the vestige of a British Cursus, according to some antiquarians, or of a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, according to others. At different and distant periods a great number of coins have been discovered, with the names of Titus, Trajan, Diocletian, Constantine, Constantius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HADRIAN\">Hadrian</a>, and other Roman emperors. Other Roman antiquities have been found at Rothley, at Wanlip, at Market Harborough, at Burrow, and at Cathorpe. The Gothic remains are considerable; those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a> of Leicester, of the Nunnery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a> Dieu, Ulvestoft Priory, Laund Priory, the Castle of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, the churches of Hinckley and Melton-Mowbray, and the chapel of Market Harborough, all reward the inspection of the antiquarian.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Lutherworth, the pulpit and part historical of the vestments of the great reformer Wickliffe are Notices, still preserved. He was buried there in 1387; but, in 1428, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> were taken up and burnt, and the ashes thrown into the river, by order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>. Leicestershire has been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of two great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> events, which have been the means of transferring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of England. The first the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSWORTH\">Bosworth</a>, which terminated the reign and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Richard III. in 1485, and the other the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NASEBY\">Naseby</a> in 1645, which led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I., and the subsequent elevation of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nLeicestershire returns but four members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, viz. two for the county, and two for the borough of Leicester.\n\nThe noblemen and gentlemen's seats are very numerous: the most remarkable are, Belvoir Castle, Duke of Rutland; Beaumanoir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, W. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HERRICK\">Herrick</a>, Esq.; Buckminster, Sir William Manners; Staunton Harold, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Ferrers; Kirkby Park, Sir R. Milbank; Normanton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, George Pochin, Esq.; Rothley Temple, T. Babbington, Esq.; Stapleford, Earl of Harborough; Stoughton Grange, G. A. L. Keck, Esq.; Donnington Park, Marquis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HASTINGS\">Hastings</a>; Gospat Hall, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">Honourable</a> R. Curzon; Stewards Hay, Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMFORD\">Stamford</a>.\n\nSee Nicholls's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Leicestershire; and Parliamentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a> Papers.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITRIM\">LEITRIM</a> is a county in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONNAUGHT\">Connaught</a>, bounded on the north by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DONEGAL\">Donegal</a> and the county of Fermanagh, on the east and south-east by Cavan and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGFORD\">Longford</a>, and on the south and west by Roscommon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLIGO\">Sligo</a>. It is about 58 English miles long, and from 7 to 20 broad, and contains 604 English square miles, or 386,560 English acres, divided into five baronies, and seventeen parishes. Half this area or more consists of bog, waste, and water. The centre of the county is in north latitude 55\u00b0, and west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> 7\u00b0.\n\nThe river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHANNON\">Shannon</a>, which enters Leitrim on the surface, &c., north-east from Cavan, about five miles from its source, and soon after flows into Lough Allen, forms, after issuing from that lake on the south, the boundary with Roscommon, on the south-west, till it leaves this county at the village of Rusky. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRICK\">Carrick</a> on Shannon to Rusky the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is well wooded, fertile, and exceedingly pleasant; but from the southern side of Lough Allen to the northern boundaries, throughout its whole breadth, the greater part of the surface is occupied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and presents, though not without several exceptions, a very rugged and sterile appearance. The Shannon is the only river of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; another, the Abhain-Naille, is remarkable for having its source in the lake Killowmawn, situated on the summit of a mountain, called Leacka, into which no streams flow.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> lake is Lough Allen, near the middle of the western boundary, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles long, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> miles broad. Lough Melvyn and Lough Gill, though much smaller, deserve to be noticed for the beauty of the scenery on their banks, and the former for its wooded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> and ruins. In these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and also in the Shannon and most of the rivulets, various sorts of fish, the perch in particular, are in great abundance.\n\nThere are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tracts of a dark fertile soil incumbent on limestone in the low grounds, but the hills are for the most part covered with a coarse unproductive clay mixed with gravel, and very retentive of water. Below this clay, slate of different colours sometimes occurs. Ironstone, in some places alternating with limestone, is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and it was formerly worked to some extent. Coal is found in the mountain Sliebh-an-Erin, on the east side of Lough Allen, and has been raised in quantities for some years, but it is not of a good quality, and is employed only in founderies. Pipe-clay and ochre appear in the beds of the rivulets that descend from this mountain. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">Lead</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> are known to exist in several places; and there is a great variety of clays and marls. Mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, both chalybeate and sulphurous, are not unfrequent, and have been used with very beneficial effects.\n\nAbout the beginning of the eighteenth century, Leitrim is said to have been almost a continued forest. There is now little wood in it, and no considerable plantations. The proprietors, however, have of late paid some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to this method of improvement, and several large nurseries have been established for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of forest and other trees.\n\nThis county is in general divided into large estates, and nearly all the great proprietors are absentee. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> are commonly for three lives or thirty-one years. Agriculture is here in a very low state. The tillage farms are small, seldom exceeding fifty or sixty acres, and these are almost always subdivided among a number of tenants. The plough is very little used. The most common implement is the loy, a kind of spade eighteen inches long, about four inches broad at the bottom, and five or six inches at the top, where it is furnished with a wooden handle about five feet long. The first two crops are potatoes, which are followed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, and then oats for one or more years. Clovers and other green crops are unknown in the practice of the tenantry. The county raises grain and potatoes sufficient for its own consumption, but exports very little of either. Its cattle have been much improved by the introduction of English breeds, to which some of those now bred and reared in it are said to be not inferior. There are no considerable dairies, yet a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> is made throughout the district, and some of this is sent to the market of Sligo. The sheep are of the native race, small, and but few in number.\n\nIn 1802, the number of families multiplied by five, gave a population of 76,630, in which, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a>, the Catholics are as thirty to one. The principal towns are Carrick on Shannon, Carrigallen, Mohill, Ballinamore, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANOR\">Manor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, none of which contains more than a few hundred inhabitants. Leitrim, from which the county takes its name, has been for many years of still less importance, though it is pleasantly situated on the Shannon. There are several bleachfields, and some coarse potteries; and a number of people are employed in weaving. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> made here, as well as the coarse woollen goods, is chiefly for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the inhabitants themselves. The houses of the lower classes are of the worst description; even the more recently erected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> buildings, including a little barn and cow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, do not cost more than \u00a310 or \u00a312. Turf is their only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, and potatoes and oat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of food, meat being used on extraordinary occasions only; but the people are said to be comfortably clothed. In 1802, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> were only from Wages and 4d. to 6d. a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> for cottars, and 6\u00bdd. with breakfast Prices and dinner, for occasional labourers, and these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> have not been much altered since. The price of potatoes is from 1\u00bdd. to 3d., and of oatmeal from 1s. to 1s. 9d. per stone. Even among the old people the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is in general use. Leitrim county sends two members to Parliament. See Macparlan's Agricultural Survey of Leitrim, and the general works quoted under the former Irish counties.","sp":542,"ep":545},{"h":"LEMONNIER","t":"a diligent and accurate astronomer, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 23rd November 1715, was the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Lemonnier, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ST_SEVER\">St Sever</a> in Normandy.\n\nHis father was a professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> d'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARCOURT\">Harcourt</a>, and a member of the Academy of Sciences: he distinguished himself, as a teacher, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> in promoting the introduction of mathematical reasoning into the Cartesian philosophy. Under such auspices, the son might have enjoyed facilities for the cultivation of any of the sciences; but he soon showed a decided preference for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and began to be a practical observer before he was sixteen. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November 1732, Mr Fouchy procured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURAL\">mural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> of three feet radius, and he soon applied himself with diligence to the determination of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s greatest equation,\u2014an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for many years; and in 1741, he found the equation to amount to $1\u00b0 55' 31''$, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> differing only by $7''$ from Delambre's latest determination.\n\nHe presented to the Academy of Sciences, in 1735, an elaborate map of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, accompanied by some remarks; and in the month of April of the following year, before he was twenty-one years old, he was made a member of the Academy, in the character of Adjunct Geometrician. He continued to be a constant contributor to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> for more than fifty years. The winter of 1736 and 1737 he passed at Torneo, with Clairaut and Maupertuis, as a member of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> appointed by the Academy for measuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>; and he was not less zealous than any of his colleagues in the execution of that arduous undertaking.\n\nHe is considered as having effected, in conjunction with Lacaille, a complete reformation in the practical astronomy of France. He entered very early into correspondence with the English astronomers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; they had carried their instruments and modes of observation to a higher degree of per-\nLemonnier. flection than their neighbours; and Lemonnier was of great use to the science, in making known to his countrymen the practical methods of Flamsteed, and in introducing the instruments of Graham and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a>. In April 1739, he was made a Foreign member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and for the last twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fourteen years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he is said to have been the senior member of the Society. He was the first that introduced the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUTATION\">nutation</a>, then lately discovered by Bradley, into the solar tables; and he complained bitterly of Lacaille's injustice, in not giving him due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> for the improvement.\n\nThe Duc de Noailles made him known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of France, who was fond of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, and showed him many kindnesses; in 1742, he gave him apartments at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPUCINS\">Capucins</a> in the Rue St Honor\u00e9, where he continued to live till the Revolution: on another occasion, when he had taken great pains to fix an accurate meridian at St Sulpice, the king made him a present of 15,000 livres, which he expended in the purchase of instruments, as the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> that he was capable of enjoying.\n\nThe places of the stars, which he determined in 1740, served Lalande for the purpose of computing their proper motions, though they differed a little from the results of Bradley's observations. About 1746, he was much engaged in examining the inequalities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>: and Euler employed his computations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, which obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> in 1748; each confirming the accuracy of the other. He continued to observe the moon, without intermission, for fifty years, though a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> only of his observations was published.\n\nIn the year 1748 he went to England, partly for the purpose of obtaining further information, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> acquaintance with the astronomers and opticians resident in London, and partly in order to observe the solar eclipse of that year, in a situation where it would be very nearly annular. He proceeded accordingly to Scotland with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Morton, accompanied by Short the optician, and they observed the eclipse together at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABERDOUR\">Aberdour</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> residence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Morton's in Fifehire. They obtained their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> from the College at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where there was a transit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, by means of the flash of a cannon fired from the castle at twelve, and another five minutes after. \"The eclipse was so nearly annular, that at the nearest approach, the cusps seemed to want about one-seventh of the moon's circumference to be joined; yet a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> was plainly observed, both by Lord Morton and myself,\" says Mr Short, \"to proceed or stretch along the circumference of the moon, from each of the cusps, about one-third of the whole distance of the cusps from each cusp; and there remained about one-third of the whole distance of the cusps not enlightened by this brown light, so that we were for some time in suspense whether or not we were to have the eclipse annular with us. During the greatest darkness, the planet Venus was seen at Edinburgh, and other places, by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people, but I did not hear of any other stars being seen. The darkness was not great, but the sky appeared of a faint languid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.\" In fact, our mornings and evenings are always illuminated by a light, which Lemonnier has acquired more or less of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> tinge in its oblique passage through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; and when we have a similar light without the redness, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> makes it appear \"faint,\" that is, greenish or grey, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. Mr Lemonnier was particularly anxious to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the moon's diameter, which \"he found 29' 47\u00bd,\" agreeing precisely with the computed diameter, and not requiring any correction for the supposed effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRADIATION\">irradiation</a>. A similar remark was made by a very accurate practical astronomer in the eclipse of 1820.\n\nIn order to verify the position of his mural quadrant, which was of eight feet radius, and made by Bird, Lemonnier felt the advantage of having a moveable one to compare with it, and he procured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of marble eight feet by six, and fifteen inches thick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> on an axis, to which he fixed his smaller instrument, of five feet radius, in order to be able to reverse its position. He devoted a considerable portion of his time to the investigation of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, and especially to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the compass; and he endeavoured to ascertain the effect of the moon's influence on the winds, and on the atmosphere in general.\n\nLemonnier had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> disputed the accuracy of the Parisian base, measured by Cassini and Maraldi, but he was at last convinced that his objections were groundless. He was originally a most zealous friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of Lalande, but afterwards, having taken offence at some slight cause, he refused to see him for many years. In fact, he appears to have been somewhat obstinate and irritable; but he is said to have had genius, zeal, activity, and intelligence, as well as credit in the world, and reputation among men of science. He was a voluminous writer; he had much learning and sagacity, but he often wanted precision in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and his reasoning. In November 1791, he had a paralytic attack, which terminated his scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, though he survived it till the 2d April 1799, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> stroke carried him off, at H\u00e9ris, near Baieux. He was made, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, one of the 144 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> members of the National Institute, as a testimony to the merit of his past labours.\n\nHe had married, in 1763, Mlle. de Cussy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of very respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in Normandy. He had three daughters; the first married Mr de Parfouru, who was an early victim of the Revolution; the second the celebrated Lagrange; and the third her uncle, Lemonnier the physician, who was also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of considerable science, and a Member of the Royal Society of London.\n\nFrom 1735 to 1790, there are very few volumes of the Memoirs of the Academy without one or more of Lemonnier's papers; but though not unimportant in the aggregate, they are somewhat uninteresting in the detail. They relate almost exclusively to astronomical observations: eclipses, occultations, appulses, oppositions, and conjunctions; solstices, longitudes and latitudes; with some accounts of astronomical instruments and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>. There are also some memoirs relating to the sun's equation and diameter, and on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, as compared with\nLemonnier. Areturus; on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of Saturn, and on his fifth satellite; on the expansion of wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; on the transit of Venus, and on the diameter and the tables of that planet; on Euler's formula for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>; on the variation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>; on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> altitudes; on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>; on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> refraction; on Saturn's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, and on some currents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. He also published separately some extensive works, which acquired considerable celebrity.\n\n1. The first was his Histoire C\u00e9leste, 4. 1741.

Together with some remarks on navigation, and on the currents of the South Seas; all apparently from the Memoirs of the Academy. The eclipse, which was observed as annular in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, should have been total, according to the computed distances of the luminaries concerned.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, is the name of an instrument which is indented into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and has a ring for the purpose of making fast a rope, in order to move the stone, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a stay. It is called in Italian Ulivella, in French La Louve, in German Stein Zang. The lewis consists of three wedges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, forming, when put together, a dove-tail. The wedges are inserted into an equal and similar hollow dove-tail excavated in the stone. This hollow dove-tail is made exactly of the form and size of the lewis, and is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of six sides; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of vertical sides, which are opposite, equal, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, and in form of truncated isosceles triangles; a pair of inclined sides, opposite equal rectangles, equally inclined to the axis of the hole, and not parallel. The top and base of the hole are rectangles parallel to each other, the base being longer than the top. The centre of the base and the centre of the top are in one vertical line. The form of the hole, therefore, is that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> wedge, with the point cut off; it is like a cavity fitted to contain the inverted keystone of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>. When the iron dove-tail called the lewis is inserted into this hollow dove-tail made in the stone, the ring at the smaller and upper end of the iron dove-tail serves for making fast a rope, for the purpose of raising the stone. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the substance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> enables the workman to fix a rope to it by merely inserting a screw or a spike into the log; stone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not admit of these, and is made fast by the contrivance of the lewis. The lewis of the most useful form, and that which is used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, is represented at fig. A, Plate XCIV.; a and b are two pieces of iron in form of inverted wedges. These pieces are inserted into a quadrangular hole which is made in the stone. The two opposite and shortest sides of the hole are dove-tailed, or, in other words, undercut, as represented at fig. B, which is a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the hole; t is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the hole at top, o is the plan of the bottom of the hole. The hole, as represented in the figure, is five inches long at top, and six inches at bottom; the width is one inch; the depth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches. Sometimes the width is one and a half inch, and the depth four or five inches. The hole is made of such a size that the lewis fits exactly into it; a', c', b', are transverse geometrical views of the pieces a, c, b; in the transverse views it is seen that the transverse sections of the parts of these pieces that enter the stone are of the same breadth from top to bottom. The piece c is represented with a perforation at top, for the purpose of taking out this piece more easily when the lewis is to be unshipped, but the lewis is usually made without this upper perforation. The pieces a, b, are first introduced into the hole, then is driven in c, which may either be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a>, or it may be a little thicker above, in form of a wedge; the ring m is then put on, and the bolt g h is passed through the holes of the ring and of the three pieces; the bolt enters at g, and forelocks at h. The tackle by which the stone is to be elevated is hooked on the ring m.\nThis ring, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where a rope is to be passed through it, is bound round with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, to prevent the rope from being chafed by the iron of the ring.\n\nPiranesi has proposed and figured some other forms of this machine in his Antichita di Roma, but they do not appear to be so convenient as the lewis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> form above described: one of the forms of lewis given by Piranesi is represented at fig. F. The two pieces which constitute the iron dove-tail open and shut by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>; n is a bolt, which is put into the round hole at p after the instrument is inserted into the stone; this transverse bolt serves to keep the legs of the instrument spread out, so as to retain the form of the dove-tail. The lewis of the most usual form, represented at fig. A, and a lewis of another form, fig. G, are figured and described in Perrault's Vitruvius, lib. x. chap. 2, and in the Theatrum Machinarum, tab. XXXV. p. 111. In the lewis, fig. G, the iron dove-tail L has a ring at top, r, for receiving a rope; L is put into the dove-tailed hole in the stone, and then the two parallelopipedal iron bolts e, u, are put in on each side of the iron dove-tail; e and u are of equal thickness throughout. The top of the hole must not be less than the bottom of the piece L, to the end that L may enter into the hole. The ring must not project beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> which form the prolongation of the inclined sides of the wedge L; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the ring projected, the pieces e, u, could not be put into the hole. The hole must be formed so that the machine fit accurately into it.\n\nThe lewis is used for raising large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of several tons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, bridges, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> fabrics, which, from the forces by which they are assailed, or on account of the long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> they are designed to endure, require to be constructed of great masses of stone. Leopold, in his Theatrum Machinarum, mentions, that in many churches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> the pavement consists of large slabs of stone or marble, each of them the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>, and covering a burying place; these slabs are laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to one another, and join accurately, so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> or crow can be introduced into the joint to raise them; in each of the slabs there is a hole cut in form of a hollow dove-tail, and into this hole a lewis is introduced when occasion requires that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> should be opened.\n\nIn the construction of harbours, the lewis fixed in a large stone frequently serves to make fast the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> which stay the cranes. The lewis is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used in the docks at London for fixing mooring-rings in the stone: the ring is easily removed when requisite, by unshipping the bolt of the lewis; for this and other reasons it is found more convenient to employ the lewis for fixing rings, than to run the ring-bolt into the stone with melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>.\n\nThe largest stones that have been wrought and moved by the industry of man occur in the buildings of the ancient Egyptians, but it is not ascertained whether their architects employed the lewis.\n\nPiranesi, in his Antichita di Roma, describes and figures lewis holes existing in the upper surface of the large stones of the tomb of Caecilia Metella at Capo di Bove, near Rome. The forcipes ferrei quorum dentes in saxa forata accommodantur, mentioned by Vitruvius, lib. x. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 2, denote a machine in the form of nippers, used to effect the raising of stones in the same way as the lewis; but the words seem to indicate a machine different in form from the lewis. Piranesi also observed in some ancient unfinished buildings, stones which appeared to have been raised by another method, namely, by knobs left on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> and side of the stone, to which knobs the ropes were attached. The knobs were taken off when the building was finished.\n\nVasari relates, in his Account of Brunellesco, that the use of the lewis was revived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, who was well skilled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, and who constructed the cupola of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Santa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> del Fiore at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, about the year 1430; the first great cupola that was built in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and which Michael Angelo had in view when he designed the cupola of Saint Peter's. The lewis called Brunellesco's is represented at fig. C Plate XCIV. Leo Baptista Alberti, a Florentine architect, who lived in 1440, in his Treatise de Architectura, mentions the lewis by the Latin name of Implocta: he describes the side wedges as having the figure of the letter D, and from that form the machine had its Italian name Ulivella, that is to say, Little Olive. Philander of Chatillon, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on Vitruvius, published at Rome in 1544, gives a figure of the lewis used at Rome in his time, which resembles that used in England, and represented at figure A. In the Archaeologiae, Vol. X. there is a description of holes observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of the keystones of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITBY\">Whitby</a>, which was built about 1370, in the reign of Edward III. as is supposed. These holes appear to have been lewis holes; they are of the form of an inverted Y, as represented at fig. D, where t is the plan of the top of the hole, and t' the plan of the bottom; the lewis that fitted into these holes would resemble that represented at fig. E: these keystones at Whitby weigh about 1\u00bd ton.","sp":545,"ep":548},{"h":"LIBERTY OF THE PRESS","t":"The task of pointing out which of the acts capable of being committed by the press it would be expedient to prohibit under penalties, we trust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found to be greatly diminished, by what we have already established in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">Jurisprudence</a>.\n\nThere is scarcely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, for the violation of which, scarcely an operation of government, for the disturbance of which the press may not be employed as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. The offences capable of being committed by the press are indeed nearly co-extensive with the whole field of delinquency.\n\nIt is not for that reason, however, necessary to give a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> for every such violation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> disturbance, for that would be to write the penal code over; first describing the violation as produced in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and then describing them anew for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in which the press is the particular instrument.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a>, for the prevention of the violation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, it were necessary to give a separate definition for every instrument which might be employed as a means of producing the violation, the penal code would be endless. In general, the means is an immaterial circumstance. The violation itself, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of alarm which may attend, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is put in fear of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and robbed of his purse, it is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> whether he is threatened with a pistol or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. In the definition of a theft, of a fraud, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, it is not necessary to include an account of all the sorts of means by which these injuries may be perpetrated. It is sufficient if the injury itself is accurately described. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to prevent the injury, not merely when produced by one sort of means or another sort of means, but by any means.\n\nFrom these illustrations it sufficiently appears, that if an accurate penal code were composed, defining the violations of rights, and disturbances of the operations of government, to which penalties were to be annexed, every offence capable of being committed by the press would be defined without mentioning its name. It is no less evident, that if we include in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBEL\">libel</a>, as, to the great encouragement of confusion, is generally done, all the offences capable of being committed by the press, we include in the definition of libel all the definitions of the penal code.\n\nAs far as persons and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> are concerned, the general definition of the acts by which rights are liable to be violated, has been held sufficient; and has been regarded as including not less the cases in which the instrumentality of the press has been employed, than those in which any other means have been employed to the same end. Nobody ever thought of a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> for restraining the press on account of the cases in which it may have been rendered subservient to the perpetration of a murder or a theft. It is enough that a law is made to punish him who has been guilty of the murder or theft, whether he has employed the press or anything else as the means for accomplishing his end.\n\nThere can be no doubt, however, that the press is an instrument peculiarly adapted for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of injuries against reputation, and for effecting disturbance to the operations of government, while it has no peculiar adaptation for the commission of other offences. Here, too, it is equally certain there is the greatest disposition to restrain the press within improper limits. It is demanded of us, therefore, upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the subject, to enter into greater detail.\n\nWe are then to inquire, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, what are the acts of the press with respect to private reputation? and next, which are the acts with respect to government, which it is desirable that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> should be employed to restrain?\n\nAgreeably to the principles which have been already considered in the article Jurisprudence, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> can be regarded as an offence with respect to an individual, which is not a violation of some of his rights.\n\nIn considering the rights which ought to be established with respect to reputation, one proposition may be assumed, that every man should be considered as having a right to the character which he deserves; in other words, to be spoken of according to his actions.\n\nIn what manner the definition of this right, which would form a part of the civil code, should be expressed, is not now the question; but it is evident that no peculiar difficulty belongs to it. As words, not thoughts, are the object of legal cognizance, the right can only have respect to security against certain words;\u2014words imputing to the individual actions which he has not performed, or a disposition to actions, of which disposition there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>.\n\nSuppose that one man has instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> against another, for the offence of having violated, through the press, his right to all the reputation he deserves. In his ground of complaint he must affirm that the man has imputed to him either the performance of actions which he did not commit, or a disposition to certain actions, of which disposition no evidence can be given.\n\nThe words are produced; and the first question is, whether they do or do not impute the actions which, in the complaint or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>, they are alleged to impute?\n\nIt is to be observed, that they who oppose the attempt to define the offences, which, for shortness, we call the offences of the press, make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of such occasions as this to raise their objections. How, they ask, can all the forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> be defined, by which the imputation of such and such actions may be either more openly, or more covertly conveyed?\n\nIt is very evident that the question on such an occasion, whether the words do or do not impute such\nor such actions, is a question of fact. The law says, that such and such actions shall not be imputed, defining the actions. Whether such and such a man has imputed such actions, either by one set of words or another, is a question of fact.\n\nThe law, when it said that such and such acts should not be imputed to a man, could not determine whether A, who is accused by B of having imputed to him one of these acts, did so or not. That is to be determined by evidence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> upon the fact. One, and in general the main article of that evidence, are the words which have been used. What is the import of these words; or, which comes to the same thing, what is the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> involved in them, is to be determined, as all questions respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of evidence are in each instance to be determined, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> before which the accusation is brought. The interpretation of words rests upon the same footing in this as in all other cases, that, for example, of a Will. The law determines that whatsoever disposition a man has made with respect to his property, shall take effect after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. But whether A has left his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a> of Dale to B, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of fact to be determined by evidence applying to that particular fact; principally by that arising from the words of the will.\n\nIt may still be argued by persons who do not easily renounce an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> to which they have once given their support, that even the actions, the interpretation of which, or that of the disposition to which the legislature means to prohibit, cannot be defined.\n\nThis, however, is a position which it is impossible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> to maintain. Some actions it is hurtful, others it is not hurtful, to a man, if he is believed to have committed, or to have a disposition to commit them. Evidently it is by imputation of the first sort alone, that any right with respect to reputation can be infringed.\n\nThe acts which a man receives injury from being believed to have committed, or to be disposed to commit, are either those to which the law has annexed penalties, or those to which the penalties of public disrepute and dislike are annexed.\n\nWith respect to those acts to which the law has annexed penalties, as theft, murder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, and so on, it will not be pretended that there is any difficulty; the law has already defined them, or ought to define them, and they may be included with perfect precision in a few words.\n\nThose acts which it is hurtful to a man, solely on account of the disrepute and dislike which they produce, to have it believed that he has committed them, may also be with sufficient accuracy determined.\n\nThe ends to be attained by punishment are, reparation to the individual to whom injury has been done, and prevention of similar acts in future.\n\nIn the idea of all punishment, effectual reparation to the injured individual is a necessary and essential ingredient. Suppose, then, it were declared by the legislature, that the imputation falsely of all acts, hurtful to the person against whom the imputation is brought, by reason of the disrepute and dislike which attach to him by whom such acts are suppo-\n\nsed to be committed, shall be punished at least by reparation to be made to the party injured; the word hurtful is to this purpose perfectly precise. It would remain with the complainant to show what kind and degree of injury he had received; which is a matter of fact, to be estimated in each instance from the evidence adduced, by the tribunal before which the question is brought. If the injury sustained is a pecuniary injury, the question coincides exactly with the question of damages, decided regularly, in English courts, as a question of fact by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>.\n\nInjuries of the kind which we are now considering can affect a man only in two ways; either, as stated above, by lessening the pecuniary value which he might otherwise have enjoyed; or, secondly, by lessening the marks of respect and affection which he would otherwise have received. What the loss is, in this latter instance, is also evidently a question of fact. It has nothing, therefore, to do with the legal definition of the offence, the business of the legislature. It is a question, which, like all other questions of fact, must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> be determined upon evidence by the tribunal before which it is brought. It is no doubt a question of delicacy, and considerable difficulty, because the evidence must often consist of very fine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstances, which can seldom be precisely ascertained. But this is not the only class of judicial questions, the determination of which depends upon such evidence as it is very difficult accurately to collect and to weigh.\n\nWhat it is of greatest importance, on this occasion, to remark is, that all the difficulty lies in the matter of fact. There is no doubt or obscurity in the law, which says, that for whatsoever hurt a man has sustained through actions or dispositions falsely imputed to him, he shall receive compensation. Difficulties, however, arising either from the complexity of the matter of fact, or the obscurity of the evidence, no legislature enactments can prevent. These are committed to the skill and fidelity of the judge.\n\nOne question for the legislature we have not yet considered; and that is, the compensation which can be made to a man for the diminution of those marks of respect and affection which he would otherwise have received. Let us suppose that a soldier has been accused of cowardice, in such a manner as to create a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the accusation; that a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> has been accused of mendacity, or of some of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> propensities to which the horror of the public is attached; it is evident that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is not an appropriate compensation for injuries thus received.\n\nWhen a man, through the offence of another, has been deprived of a certain amount of money, or of money's worth, we say that he has received compensation, when he is placed in the same situation in which he would have been if the offence had not taken place.\n\nAccording to this idea of compensation, a man, against whom an unfavourable opinion has been created by the act of another man, has received compensation, when he is placed in the same situation with regard to the opinion of those with whom he is connected, as if that act had not taken place. This,\ntherefore, is the object which it ought to be the endeavour of the legislature to effect.\n\nOne expedient is perfectly appropriate. It is, that the man who has falsely propagated an unfavourable opinion with respect to another, should be made to do whatever is in his power to remove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> he has made. To this end, he should publish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the judge, declaring that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, or disposition which he had imputed to the individual injured, he had imputed to him falsely. He should at least be made to publish it in every way in which he had published the imputation. Frequently a more extensive publication might be required.\n\nIn most cases, it will be allowed, that this much would suffice. It may, however, be affirmed, that often the impression would be too profoundly struck, to be effaced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> knowledge of the sentence of the judge. In such cases, something more in the way of compensation would be required. On this, it is of importance to be observed, that if the impression produced by an imputation, which, after solemn inquiry, the judge has declared to be false, should not, by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, be completely effaced, it implies necessarily one of two things; either that the public have evidence of the truth of the accusation, which was not adduced to the judge, and then the remaining impression is not owing to the imputation which the judge has condemned, but to the evidence; or, secondly, that the public mind is in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and imbecility, capable of forming opinions, even on the clearest subjects, not only not according to evidence, but in opposition to it. If the public mind, however, is in such a deplorable condition, it is the fault of the legislature; and for the rectification of this evil, the best course undoubtedly is, to take effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> for the instruction of the people, which instruction would soon place them beyond the danger of such contemptible as well as mischievous delusions. In the meantime, if something more than the publication of the sentence of the judge were necessary to restore a man to that degree of consideration of which the false imputation had deprived him, governments have numerous ways of raising the consequence of individuals; and no legislature would be at a loss for a gradation of expedients suited to the scale of demand.\n\nWe have now illustrated that part of this question which regards compensation to the injured individual. It remains to inquire what is best to be done in this case, for the attainment of the other object of punishment, namely, the prevention of similar offences in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to come.\n\nTo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> a punishment sufficient to prevent an offence, is to provide a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> sufficient to counteract the motive which leads to the offence. We have hence to consider what are the motives by which men are incited to make false imputations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of others.\n\nThese motives may be of three different sorts. A man may derive pecuniary profit, he may derive comparative distinction, or he may satisfy his desire of vengeance, by blackening the character of his neighbour.\n\nIn the case in which a man has by calumny wrongfully intercepted the pecuniary receipts of his neighbour, the obligation of making satisfaction to the party injured would, it is obvious, alone suffice, provided the machinery of the laws were sufficiently perfect, to render the execution of them certain. Seldom would any man calumniate his neighbour, for the sake of placing L20 in his own pocket, if he were sure that next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, or next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, he would have to restore it, with all the profit which might have been made by the use of it, and with the disgrace besides of having committed an action which other men abhor.\n\nSometimes, however, a man may derive pecuniary profit from calumniating persons whom he has not by that means deprived of any pecuniary advantage; by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, for example, of a slanderous publication; when the satisfaction due to the individual may not be of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to counteract the motive which leads to the offence. The expedient in this case, also, is sufficiently obvious, and sufficiently simple. It is necessary to ascertain the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> which has been made by the offender, and to take it away from him. This, together with the satisfaction which he ought to make to the injured individual, would, if it were certain, create a surplus of motive to abstain from the injurious act.\n\nIn both of these cases, if the execution of the law is uncertain, an additional punishment may be necessary, sufficient to compensate for the chance of escape. The allowance to be made on this score must depend upon the imperfection of the laws; while one important fact is to be kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>, that as severity of punishment, beyond a certain point, is increased, certainty of execution is diminished. The true expedient, therefore, is to render the machinery of the laws so perfect, that the penalties which they denounce may always be sure of execution; and then hardly any thing beyond compensation to the individual, and the abstraction of any additional gain which might have been made by the propagation of slander, would be necessary to repress all offences against the reputation of others, to which the motive was constituted by pecuniary gain.\n\nThe two remaining cases are still more simple. If a man propagates a falsehood, for the sake of injuring the character of a man by whom his own consideration is eclipsed, it is only when he expects to obtain by that means a permanent advantage. If he knows that immediately the law will take its hold upon him; that he will be compelled to re-elevate the character of his neighbour, and to proclaim his own disgrace, he will see that, to attempt depressing the character of another man by calumny, is the very worst of all expedients, for giving a comparative elevation to his own. The same is the result in the case where vengeance constitutes the motive to injure the reputation of another. To render this proposition manifest, the most obvious illustration will suffice. No man, to gratify his malignity to another person, would kill his ox or his ass, provided he were sure that immediately he would be obliged to make him full satisfaction; and instead of injuring the man whom he hated, to injure only him-\nNo, the rudeness and inefficacy of the law, holding out a chance of escaping the duty of making reparation, is the sole origin and cause of all offences of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>; and if the law were placed in a state but approaching perfection, hardly any thing beside the obligation of making satisfaction would be necessary to repress the whole of this order of crimes.\n\nWe have now made considerable progress in this important inquiry. We have ascertained, we think, with sufficient evidence, all that is necessary to be done for preventing injuries to the reputation of individuals; provided the rights of reputation are, by the civil code, not made to extend beyond the boundaries of truth. Whether or not they ought to extend farther, and individuals ought to be protected from the disclosure of acts which they may have committed, is, we confess, a question highly worthy of solution; upon which, therefore, before we proceed to any of the subsequent topics, we shall offer the following reflections.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the feelings of the individual may be as painful, where actions of a disreputable nature are truly, as where they are falsely imputed to him. It is equally certain that no painful feelings ought to be wilfully excited in any man, where no good, sufficient to overbalance that evil, is its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> consequence.\n\nWe have already shown, that reputation is injured by the imputation of acts of two different descriptions; first, those to which the law annexes penalties; secondly, those to which disrepute and the dislike of others are annexed.\n\nWith respect to those acts to which the law annexes penalties, there is no room for uncertainty or dispute. Unless the law is a bad law, which ought to be repealed (this, we confess, constitutes an exception), and one, which, in very imperfect codes, extends a great way), the law ought not to be disappointed of its execution. The man who gives information against a murderer, or a thief, by the press, or without the press, renders a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and deserves not punishment but reward.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the question, whether a man ought to be protected from the imputation of actions which he has really committed, refers solely to those acts which, without being punishable by the law, are attended with disrepute; acts, in other words, which the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> disapprove and dislike.\n\nThe prospect of the immediate and public exposure of all acts of this description, would be a most effectual expedient to prevent their being committed. Men would obtain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of abstaining from them, and would feel it as little painful to abstain, as at present it is to any well educated person to keep from theft, or those acts which constitute the ill manners of the vulgar. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOMUS\">Momus</a> has always been understood to carry an important moral. He found grievous fault that a window had not been placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of every man, by which, not his actions alone, but his thoughts, would have been known. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> of that Roman has been highly applauded, who not only placed his residence in such a situation that his fellow citizens might see as much as possible of his actions, but declared a wish that he could render open to the eyes of all his breast as well as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>.\n\nIf the hatred and contempt of the people, therefore, were always rightly directed, and rightly proportioned; if they never operated against any actions but those which were hurtful, either to the individual himself, or to others, and never, but in the degree in which they were hurtful, the case would be clear; the advantage which would be derived from the true exposure of any man's actions of any sort, would exceed beyond calculation the attendant evil. The great difficulty of insuring the practice of morality, in those numerous and highly important cases, to which the legal sanction, or the security of pains and penalties does not extend, consists in the want of a motive always present, and powerful enough to counteract the temporary motive which urges to the momentary offence. That motive almost every man would derive from his knowledge that the eyes were upon him of all those, the good opinion of whom it was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to preserve; and that no immoral act of his would escape their observation, and a proportionate share of their hatred and contempt. It is in this view that the aid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> has been sometimes regarded as of importance to morality; suggesting the idea of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and constant observer. All motives, however, are feeble, in proportion as the pains and pleasures upon which they depend are distant, and vague, or uncertain. Divines agree with all other men in complaining of the trifling effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> motives upon the lives of the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men. From the nature of the prospect on which these motives depend, they were necessarily as feeble as they have so often been described. Such is not the case with the motives arising from the sentiments which we know we shall inspire in the breasts of our fellow creatures. It is a matter of daily and incontrovertible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that these are among the most powerful which operate upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind. The soldier rushes upon death, and endures all the hardships and toils of his cruel profession, that he may enjoy the admiration, and escape the contempt, of his fellow men. On what else is founded the greater part of all the pursuits of mankind? How few, even of those who toil at the meanest occupations, but exert themselves to have something for show, something to make an impression upon the eyes of those who surround them? The very subject of the present inquiry derives from this source the whole of its importance. The value of reputation is, indeed, but another name for the value which we attach to the favourable and unfavourable sentiments of our fellow men.\n\nIt is, however, true, that their unfavourable sentiments do not always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> where they ought, and this, we confess, is a consideration of the highest importance. It very often happens that men's antipathies are excited to actions from which no evil ensues, either to him who performs them, or to any body else. If any man derives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> from such actions, it is to limit his sphere of innocent enjoyment, to debar him from them. And if the press exposes him to the antipathies, the hatred, and contempt of his fellow-creatures, on account of those actions, it produces.\nan evil, uncompensated by the smallest portion of good. If an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Brahman were known to have eaten, even when starving, a morsel of food which had been prepared by a Christian, the consequences to him would be dreadful. Where the Roman Catholic religion is in vigour, a man who should indulge himself in animal food on forbidden days would be regarded with horror. The use of wine, however moderate, would render a Mahomedan execrable to the whole of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>.\n\nThis misdirection of the favourable and unfavourable sentiments of mankind, in other words, this perversion and corruption of their moral sentiments, has, in by far the greater number of instances, been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of priests, contriving the means of increasing their influence. In some very important instances, such, for example, as the prejudices of birth, at one time so powerful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, as to make ineffable contempt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of the low, the highest veneration that of the man of elevated birth, the perversion of the moral sentiments, is evidently the work of the aristocratical class, securing to themselves a more easy dominion over the rest of their fellow creatures. It is, therefore, evident, that where antipathies, religious or aristocratical, should prevail, the press would be hurtfully employed in giving notoriety to the facts which would expose a man to the operation of either.\n\nWe have now ascertained the cases in which it would not be good that men should be protected from the declaration of truth by the press, and also the cases in which it would be good that they should be so protected.\n\nWhat, upon this view of the subject, would be desirable, is sufficiently clear. It would be desirable that, in the one set of cases, the declaration should be allowed, in the other it should not be allowed. Are the two sets of cases, however, capable of being accurately distinguished?\n\nIf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> is made with any attention, it will not be difficult to determine that the evil to be incurred by the loss of truth in the set of cases in which the declaration of it would be useful, is much greater than that which would arise from permitting the declaration in the cases in which it would be hurtful.\n\nIn the first place, the set of cases in which the declaration would be useful are much more numerous, and much more important, than those in which, in any tolerably civilized state of society, it would be hurtful. Those in which it would be useful embrace the whole field of morality, all those acts, the performance of which, on account of their singular importance, has been elevated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of virtues. Every body believes and proclaims, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> practice of the moral virtues would ensure the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; no one doubts that the misery which, to so deplorable a degree, overspreads the globe, while men injure men, and instead of helping and benefiting, supplant, defraud, mislead, pillage, and oppress, one another, would thus be nearly exterminated, and something better than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> would be realized upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Toward the attainment of this most desirable state of things, nothing in the world is capable of contributing so much as the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of truth upon all immoral actions,\u2014all actions, the practice of which is calculated to lessen the amount of human happiness. According to this view, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of which it is impossible to dispute, the evil incurred by forbidding the declaration of truth upon all immoral actions is incalculable. That which would be incurred by the antipathies of misguided minds against actions innocent in themselves, nobody, we should imagine, would so much as think of placing in comparison.\n\nIn our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, for example, the classes of actions which, though they injure nobody, expose a man to the unfavourable sentiments of others, are not numerous. The number of persons who would be exposed to inconvenience on account of the declaration of truth, in regard to them, would be small in comparison with those who would benefit by its declaration, in the case of all really hurtful acts.\n\nIt is, indeed, important to be observed, that a comparative smallness of number is necessarily implied in the supposition of injury from any unfounded antipathy. Those who share in the antipathy, of course, abstain from the action. And unless the antipathy were so general as to include almost the whole of the society, it would lose its injurious effect. Besides, all the injury which can be done to the individuals against whom truth would in this manner operate injuriously, would be, to make them abstain from the acts which were thus condemned.\n\nAnother thing to be considered is, that the whole of the evil arising from the exercise of truth is dependent upon an accidental circumstance, capable of being removed upon a mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, requiring to be cured; of which, of course, the legislature ought to undertake the case, and toward the cure of which truth is likely to operate as the most effectual of all expedients. If any considerable inconvenience were experienced from exposure to unfounded antipathies by publications of truth, the groundlessness of these antipathies could not fail to be so often canvassed, and made to appear, that at last it would become familiar to the multitude, and the antipathies would expire.\n\nIt clearly, therefore, appears, that, if the cases in which the declaration of truth would expose to unfounded prejudices could not be clearly defined, and separated from the cases in which the declaration would be salutary, the rule of permitting truth ought to be universal. But though we perceive, that, to a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, there are cases, in respect to which it would be vain to hope for agreement in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the line of distinction between what is hurtful and what is not, we are persuaded that principles might be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in which all would agree, and which would serve to mark out certain cases for exception with sufficient exactness. If any such cases could be separated, either of actions which, though injurious to nobody, excited antipathies, or of facts, as those of birth, for which, though a man was in no respect worse, he might be regarded as worse, the exercise of truth, with regard to them, might, on the express ground of these being actions innoxious, or facts which ought to be\nWe have now explained, we trust, with sufficient clearness for the present occasion, the principles upon which laws should be constructed for protecting the rights of individuals against violations committed by the press. The first part of this inquiry, therefore, we must consider as completed. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> part we have to explain the principles upon which they should be constructed for protecting the operations of government.\n\nThis question involves a point which presents the appearance of considerable difficulty. In the first place, unless a door is left open to resistance of the government, in the largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the word, the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience is adopted; and the consequence is, the universal prevalence of misgovernment, with the misery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of the people. In the second place, unless the operations of government, instituted for the protection of rights, are secured from obstruction, the security of rights, and all the advantages dependent upon the existence of government, are at an end. Between these two securities, both necessary to obtain the benefits of good government, there appears to be such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a>, that the one can only be obtained by the sacrifice of the other.\n\nAs this difficulty, however, arises chiefly from the largeness of the terms, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> inspection of the cases which they involve, and which they have a tendency to confuse, will enable us to discover the course which it belongs to practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> to pursue.\n\nIt is necessary, first of all, to ascertain what sort of obstructions are inconsistent and what are not inconsistent, with the operations of government, which are necessary for the protection of rights.\n\nThe application of physical force to resist the government in applying, to the execution of the laws, the physical power placed at its disposal by the law, is such an obstruction of the operations of government as would, if frequent, render it inadequate to the ends which it is provided to secure. This application of force, therefore, must be treated as an offence; and any thing proceeding from the press, tending directly to produce it, as a similar offence.\n\nThis proposition requires to be illustrated. The application of physical force which is here described, and treated as an evil, is clearly distinguishable from that resistance of government which is the last security of the many against the misconduct of the few. This is an application of physical force to obstruct the operations of government in detail; the proceedings, for example, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of justice; the proceedings of the legislative organ, or the proceedings of any of the administrative functionaries, in the execution of the duties with which they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>. This is not that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of resistance which is necessary in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to secure the people against the abuse of the powers of government. This last is not a resistance to the operations of government in detail. It is a resistance to all the powers of government at once, either to withdraw them from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> in which they have hitherto been deposited, or greatly to modify the terms upon which they are held.\n\nEven this last species of resistance it may be necessary to punish, at least in a certain degree, whenever it is not successful; that society may not be disturbed by frequent commotions, in the motives to which, the majority of the people do not partake. This, however, is a question which belongs to the penal code in general, and does not concern the inquiry into the offences capable of being committed by the press: because we think it may be satisfactorily shown, that no operation of the press, however directly exhorting to this species of resistance, ought to be treated as an offence. The reason is, that no such exhortation can have any immediate or formidable effect; can, indeed, have any effect at all, except through such mediums as ought to be at all times perfectly free. Suppose that a work is published, exhorting the people in general to take arms against the government, for the purpose of altering it against the consent of its rulers. The people cannot take arms against the government without the certainty of being immediately crushed, unless there has been already created a general consent. If this consent exists in such perfection as to want nothing to begin action but an exhortation, nothing can prevent the exhortation, and forbidding it is useless. If the consent does not exist in nearly the last degree of perfection, a mere exhortation, read in print, can have no effect which is worth regarding. In all circumstances, therefore, it is useless, and consequently absurd, to treat this species of exhortation as an offence. If, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it were clearly recognized, that every man had a licence to exhort the people to the general resistance of the government, all such exhortations would become ridiculous, unless on those rare and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> occasions in which no prohibitions and no penalties can or ought to prevent them. The doctrine of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>, which will appear somewhat startling and paradoxical to minds accustomed only to a certain train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, will receive illustration, and we trust will be amply confirmed as we proceed.\n\nHaving mentioned this as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> exception, we now return to the cases in which not only physical force applied to obstruct the operations of government, but the publishing of exhortations to that obstruction, ought to be treated as an offence. These relate solely, as above remarked, to the operations of government in detail. Obstructions, it is evident, may be offered to the operations in detail of a government which possesses and deserves the fullest confidence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and the press may be employed in directly and efficiently exciting to these obstructions. A hand-bill, for example, may be distributed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, which, operating upon an inflamed state of mind, in a narrow district, may excite a mob to disturb the proceedings of a court of justice, to obstruct the officers of law, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, or government, in the execution of their duties, or to disturb, on this or that occasion, the deliberations of the legislature itself.\n\nThese are clearly hurtful acts; they may be very\naccurately defined; and penalties, of moderate severity, would be sufficient to deter from the performance of them. The obligation of the offending party to make satisfaction to the party injured, would often, in offences of this description, be excluded, because there would be no definite party to whom an injury would be occasioned. It would only be necessary to ascertain the sorts of motives by which such offences would be liable to be produced, and to apply skilfully, as in other cases, motives of an opposite tendency, sufficient to counteract them. This would not be more difficult in this than in other cases, and it is not, therefore, necessary to explain at any length the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of performing it. One principle is to be carefully and most religiously observed, that of not imposing an atom of punishment for the purposes of vengeance. This is a principle, the justness and importance of which are so completely recognized, that we might have expected to be relieved ere now from the necessity of recommending attention to it. The fact, however, is, that so long as there are abuses in governments, so long will the men who have the means of profiting by those abuses, exert themselves to multiply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of offences against government, and to apply to them punishments of the greatest severity. Punishments for contempt of court; punishments to vindicate the honour of the court, of the government, of the magistracy; punishments for the support of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; punishments severe in proportion as the dignity of the party offended is supposed to be high, and so on, are punishments almost always applied for purposes of vengeance, or the protection of the instruments of abuse. They are punishments, therefore, which will be rigidly excluded from a code which wisely and steadily pursues the general good.\n\nWhat the sort of acts are, to which the exhortations of the press ought not to be applied, has been so far ascertained. The next point is, to determine with accuracy what sort of exhortation it is that ought to be forbidden. To all those who profit by the abuses of government, that is, more especially to all those who, in a defective government, wield any of its powers, it is of great importance to leave, as undefined as possible, the sort of exhortation that ought to be forbidden. The point of greatest importance to them is, to keep the people at large from complaining, or from knowing or thinking that they have anything of which to complain. If this grand object is fully attained, they may then, without anxiety, and without trouble, riot in the pleasures of misrule. There is no limit to the degree in which the few may pursue their own advantage at the expense of the many. There can be nothing, therefore, in which they have a greater interest, than preventing the press from being employed in any such way, as will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the people to think that they have anything, on the part of their rulers, of which to complain. All artifices possible will be sure to be employed to effect that prevention. And if it is enacted, that exhortations to acts which obstruct the operations of government in detail should be punished, without defining accurately what sort of exhortations, they will easily find expedients which, to a great extent, will accomplish their purpose.\n\nUnder the sort of constructions which it will be their interest to apply, every thing which can be done by the press, to make the people know or believe that there is anything in the system of their government, or the conduct of their rulers, of which they have to complain, may be treated as an exhortation to obstruct the operations of government. Of these constructions, our experience affords innumerable examples. Does not the imputing of defects to the government, or misconduct to those who wield the powers of government, tend to bring both \"into hatred and contempt?\" And if the people hate and contemn the institutions and rulers of their country, will they not oppose their operations? The imputing of these faults, therefore, is it not, in essence and effect, an exhortation to oppose the operations of government? And are we to be governed, in our legislature, by the mere forms in which a set of words may appear, and not by our knowledge of their nature and consequences?\n\nThis is not only exceedingly plausible, but almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> which it involves are perfectly true. It is thus, therefore, the more easy to establish such a mode of interpreting an indefinite law of the press, as will prevent, or where the people cannot yet bear a total prevention, will go far towards preventing whatever can lead the people to believe that anything is amiss in the manner in which they are ruled.\n\nThere are two species of exhortations, one the explicit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, the other implied and constructive. In the one, a particular act is pointed out, and the party, or parties, addressed are called upon to perform it. In the other, certain grounds only are laid, from which the opinion of the addressee may be inferred, more or less certainly, that the act ought to be performed.\n\nWith respect to the first, there is no occasion for doubt. A direct and explicit exhortation to commit one of those acts described above, as obstructing the operations of government in detail, should be treated as an offence. The precise question is, whether any exhortation, which is only implied and constructive, should be considered an offence? In the answer to this question, almost everything which relates to the use of the press in matters of government, will be found to be involved.\n\nWe have already divided the subject of resistance to government into two parts; first, that general resistance, the object of which is, some great change in the government at large; and, secondly, resistance to this or that of its operations in detail.\n\nWe have already adduced an argument, which appears to us to be conclusive, to show, that no exhortation, whether explicit or implied, direct or indirect, the object or tendency of which is to produce the first species of resistance, ought to be subject to legal restraint.\n\nIt is necessary here to enter a little more fully into the grounds of that opinion.\n\nWe think it will appear, with sufficient evidence, that in the way of indirect exhortation to resistance,\nthat is, in laying the grounds of dissatisfaction with the government, there is no medium between allowing every thing and allowing nothing; that the end, in short, which is sought to be gained, by allowing any thing to be published in censure of the government cannot be obtained, without leaving it perfectly free to publish every thing.\n\nThe end which is sought to be obtained by allowing any thing to be said in censure of the government, is to ensure the goodness of the government, the most important of all the objects, to the attainment of which, the wisdom of man can be applied. If the goodness of government could be ensured by any preferable means, it is evident that all censure of the government ought to be prohibited. All discontent with the government is only good, so far as it is a means of removing real cause of discontent. If there is no cause, or if there is better means of removing the cause, the discontent is, of course, an evil, and that which produces it an evil.\n\nSo true it is, however, that the discontent of the people is the only means of removing the defects of vicious governments, that the freedom of the press, the main instrument of creating discontent, is, in all civilized countries, among all but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of misgovernment, regarded as an indispensable security, and the greatest safeguard of the interests of mankind.\n\nFor what is meant by a vicious government? or wherein do the defects of government consist? Most assuredly they all consist in sacrificing the interests of the many to the interests of the few. The small number, in whose hands the powers of government are in part directly, in part indirectly placed, cannot fail, like other men, to have a greater regard for what is advantageous to themselves, than what is advantageous to other men. They pursue, therefore, their own advantage, in preference to that of the rest of the community. That is enough. Where there is nothing to check that propensity, all the evils of misgovernment, that is, in one word, the worst evils by which human nature is cursed, are the inevitable consequence. (See the article Government.)\n\nThere can be no adequate check without the freedom of the press. The evidence of this is irresistible. In all countries, the people either have a power legally and peaceably of removing their governors, or they have not that power. If they have not that power, they can only obtain very considerable ameliorations of their governments by resistance, by applying physical force to their rulers, or, at least, by threats so likely to be followed by performance, as may frighten their rulers into compliance. But resistance, to have this effect, must be general. To be general, it must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from a general conformity of opinion, and a general knowledge of that conformity. How is this effect to be produced, but by some means, fully enjoyed by the people, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> their sentiments to one another? Unless where the people can all meet in general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, there is no other means known to the world of attaining this object to be compared with the freedom of the press.\n\nIt is, no doubt, true, that in countries where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of the press is unknown, evil governments are frequently overthrown. This is almost always accomplished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force, revenging some grievance of their own, or falling in with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and animosity of the people. But does it ever enable them to make a new government, in which any greater security is provided for their interests than there was before? In such cases, the people get rid of one set of rulers, whom they hate, only to obtain another set, with equal powers of doing them injury.\n\nThere are, however, we believe, some people who say, that though the liberty of the press is a necessary instrument to attain good government, yet, if it is fairly attained, and if legal and peaceable means are in the hands of the people of removing their governors for misconduct,\u2014if the people of England, for example, really chose the members of the House of Commons, and renewed their choice so frequently as to have the power of removal after a short experience of misconduct, the freedom of the press would be unnecessary.\n\nSo far is this from being true, that it is doubtful whether a power in the people of choosing their own rulers, without the liberty of the press, would be an advantage.\n\nIt is perfectly clear, that all chance of advantage to the people from having the choice of their rulers, depends upon their making a good choice. If they make a bad choice\u2014if they elect people either incapable, or disinclined, to use well the power entrusted to them, they incur the same evils to which they are doomed when they are deprived of the due control over those by whom their affairs are administered.\n\nWe may then ask, if there are any possible means by which the people can make a good choice, but the liberty of the press? The very foundation of a good choice is knowledge. The fuller and more perfect the knowledge, the better the chance, where all sinister interest is absent, of a good choice. How can the people receive the most perfect knowledge relative to the characters of those who present themselves to their choice, but by information conveyed freely, and without reserve, from one to another?\n\nThere is another use of the freedom of the press, no less deserving the most profound attention, that of making known the conduct of the individuals who have been chosen. This latter service is of so much importance, that upon it the whole value of the former depends.\n\nThis is capable of being rigidly demonstrated. No benefit is obtained by making choice of a man who is well qualified to serve the people, and also well inclined to serve them, if you place him in a situation in which he will have motives sufficient to serve himself at their expense.\n\nIf any set of men are chosen to wield the powers of government, while the people have not the means of knowing in what manner they discharge their duties, they will have the means of serving themselves at the expense of the people; and all the miseries of evil government are the certain consequences.\n\nSuppose the people to choose the members of the Legislative Assembly, with power of rechoosing, or dismissing, at short intervals: To what desirable end\ncould these powers be exercised, without the liberty of the press? Suppose that any one of those whom they have chosen has misconducted himself, or promoted, as far as depended upon him, the ends of misgovernment, how are the people to know that the powers with which they had entrusted him had been treacherously employed?\n\nIf they do not know, they will rechoose him, and that as cordially as the man who has served them with the greatest fidelity. This they are under a deplorable necessity of doing, even to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a>; for, as they know no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between him and the best, it would be on their part iniquity to make any. The consequences would be fatal. If one man <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that he might promote misrule for his own advantage, so would another; so, of course, would they all. In these circumstances, we see laid the foundation on which, in every country, bad government is reared. On this foundation it is impossible that it should not be reared. When the causes are the same, who can expect that the effects will be different? It is unnecessary to dwell upon these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> truths, because they have already been developed in the article Government.\n\nWithout the knowledge, then, of what is done by their representatives, in the use of the powers entrusted to them, the people cannot profit by the power of choosing them, and the advantages of good government are unavailable. It will surely not cost many words to satisfy all classes of readers that, without the free and unrestrained use of the press, the requisite knowledge cannot be obtained.\n\nThat an accurate report of what is done by each of the representatives, a transcript of his speeches, and a statement of his propositions and votes, is necessary to be laid before the people, to enable them to judge of his conduct, nobody, we presume, will deny. This requires the use of the cheapest means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, and, we add, the free use of those means. Unless every man has the liberty of publishing the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, the people can have no security that they are fairly published. If it is in the power of their rulers to permit one person, and forbid another, the people may be sure that a false report\u2014a report calculated to make them believe that they are well governed, when they are ill governed, will be often presented to them.\n\nOne thing more is necessary, and so necessary, that, if it is wanting, the other might as well be wanting also. The publication of the proceedings tells what is done. This, however, is useless, unless a correct judgment is passed upon what is done.\n\nWe have now brought the inquiry to this important point; in the article Government, we have seen that, unless the people hold in their own hands an effectual power of control on the acts of their government, the government will be inevitably vicious. We have now seen, that they cannot exercise this control to any beneficial purpose without the means of forming a correct judgment upon the conduct of their representatives. We have likewise seen, that one of the means necessary to enable them to judge correctly of the conduct of their representatives, is the liberty to every body of publishing reports of what they do. It remains to inquire, by what other acts the press can be made to contribute to the same desirable end.\n\nWhat is wanted is, that all the people, or as many of them as possible, should estimate correctly the consequences of the acts proposed or done by their representatives, and also that they should know what acts might have been proposed, if the best were not proposed, from which better consequences would have followed. This end would be accomplished most effectually, if those who are sufficiently enlightened would point out to those who are in danger of mistakes, the true conclusions; and showing the weight of evidence to be in their favour, obtain for them the universal assent.\n\nHow is this to be accomplished? In what manner are those wise men to be chosen? And who are to be the choosers? Surely it is evident the object cannot be attained. There are no distinct and indubitable marks by which wisdom, and less by which integrity, is to be known. And who is to be trusted with the privilege of pointing them out? They whose judgment requires to be directed are not well qualified to determine who shall direct them. And if the rulers are to choose, they will employ those only who will act in uniformity to their views, and enable them to benefit themselves by the pillage and oppression of the people.\n\nAs there is no possible organ of choice, no choice whatever ought to be made. If no choice is to be made, every man that pleases ought to be allowed. All this is indubitable. The consequences of denying any part of it are so obvious, that hardly any man, we suppose, will risk the imputations to which such a denial would justly expose him.\n\nThey who say that no choice ought to be made, say, in effect, that no limit whatsoever ought to be imposed upon the liberty of the press. The one of these propositions is involved in the other. To impose any restraint upon the liberty of the press undoubtedly is to make a choice. If the restraint is imposed by the government, it is the government that chooses the directors of the public mind. If any government chooses the directors of the public mind, the government is despotic.\n\nSuppose that, by the restraint imposed upon the liberty of the press, all censure of the government is forbidden, here is undoubtedly a choice. The government, in this case, verbally says, the people who might attempt the task of directing the public mind are of two sorts; one that of those who would censure, another that of those who would not censure; I choose the latter.\n\nSuppose that not every censure, but only such and such kinds of censure, are forbidden, here, again, is still a choice, while confessedly there is no party to whom the power of choosing for the rest can with safety be given.\n\nIf not every censure, but only some censures, are to be forbidden, what are those to which the prohibition should extend? The answer to this question will elucidate nearly all that yet remains in any degree obscure, of the doctrine of the liberty of the press.\n\nIt will not be said that any censure which is just\nLiberty of the press should be forbidden; because that would undoubtedly be to detract from the means of enabling the people to form correct judgments; and we have, we trust, rendered it indisputable that no source of benefit to society is at all to be compared with that of correct judgments on their government and its functionaries, formed among the people, and determining their actions.\n\nBut what censures are just and what are unjust; in other words, what are the conclusions which ought to be formed respecting the properties and the acts of the government, is exactly the point to be determined. If you say that no man is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> an unjust censure upon the government, who is to judge? It is surely unnecessary to repeat the proof of the proposition, that there is nobody who can safely be permitted to judge. The path of practical wisdom is as clear as day. All censures must be permitted equally, just and unjust.\n\nWhere various conclusions are formed among a number of men, upon a subject on which it would be unsafe, and therefore improper, to give to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> portion of them a power of determining for the rest, only one expedient remains. Fortunately, that is an expedient, the operation of which is powerful, and its effects beneficial in the highest degree. All the conclusions which have formed themselves in the minds of different individuals, should be openly adduced; and the power of comparison and choice should be granted to all. Where there is no motive to attach a man to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, it is natural to him to embrace the truth; especially if pains are taken to adapt the explanation to his capacity. Every man, possessed of reason, is accustomed to weigh evidence, and to be guided and determined by its preponderance. When various conclusions are with their evidence, presented with equal care and with equal skill, there is a moral certainty, though some few may be misguided, that the greater number will judge aright, and that the greatest force of evidence, wherever it is, will produce the greatest impression.\n\nAs this is a proposition upon which every thing depends, it is happy that the evidence of it should be so very clear and striking. There is, indeed, hardly any law of human nature more generally recognized, wherever there is not a motive to deny its existence. \"To the position of Tully, that if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">Virtue</a> could be seen, she must be loved, may be added,\" says Dr Johnson, \"that if Truth could be heard, she must be obeyed.\" (Rambler, No. 87.)\u2014 \"Je vous plains, mes Peres,\" says Mons. Pascal to the Jesuits, \"d'avoir recours \u00e0 de tels remedes. Vous croyez avoir la force et l'impu\u00e9rit\u00e9; mais je crois avoir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et l'innocence. C'est une \u00e9trange et longue guerre que celle ou la violence essaie d'opprimer la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Tous les efforts de la violence ne peuvent affoiblir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et ne servent qu'\u00e0 la relever davantage: toutes les lumi\u00e8res de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ne peuvent rien pour arr\u00eater la violence, et ne font que l'irriter encore plus. Quand la force <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> la force, la plus puissante detruit la moindre: quand l'on expose les discours aux discours, ceux qui sont veritables et convainquants confondent et dissipent ceux qui n'ont que la vanit\u00e9 et le men-\n\nsonge.\" (Lett. Provinc. 12.)\u2014\"Reason,\" says Burke, \"clearly and manfully delivered, has in itself a mighty force; but reason, in the mouth of legal authority, is, I may fairly say, irresistible.\" (Lett. on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGICIDE\">Regicide</a> Peace.)\n\nIt is of importance to show how many of the greatest men, of all ages and countries, have borne testimony to the prevalence of true over false conclusions, when both are fairly offered to the human mind. \"Truth,\" says Mr Locke, \"certainly would do well enough, if she were once left to shift for herself. She seldom has received, and I fear never will receive, much assistance from the power of great men, to whom she is but rarely known, and more rarely welcome. She is not taught by laws, nor has she any need of force to procure her entrance into the minds of men.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> on Toleration.) The following is the emphatical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Montesquieu: \"La raison a un empire naturel; elle a m\u00eame un empire tyranique: on lui resiste, mais <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> resistance est son triomphe, encore un peu de temps, et l'on sera force de revenir \u00e0 elle.\" (Esp. de Loix, l. 28, ch. 38.)\u2014It is noted out of Cicero, by Machiavel, that the people, though they are not so prone to find out truth of themselves, as to follow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, or run into error; yet if they be shown truth, they not only acknowledge and embrace it very suddenly, but are the most constant and faithful guardians and conservators of it.\" (Harringtons)\u2014\"The labour of a contutation,\" says Chillingworth, \"I have not in any place found such labour or difficulty, but that it was undertakeable by a man of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> abilities; and the reason is, because it is Truth I plead for; which is so strong an argument for itself, that it needs only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> to discover it.\" (Religion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>)\u2014\"About things on which the public thinks long,\" says Dr Johnson, \"it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> attains to think right.\" (Life of Addison.)\u2014\"The adversary,\" says Dr Campbell, \"is both subtle and powerful. With such an adversary, I should on very unequal terms enter the lists, had I not the advantage of being on the side of truth. And an eminent advantage this doubtless is. It requires but moderate abilities to speak in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of a good cause. A good cause demands but a distinct exposition, and a fair hearing; and we may say, with great propriety, it will speak for itself.\" (Campbell on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">Miracles</a>. Introd.)\n\nWe have then arrived at the following important conclusions,\u2014that there is no safety to the people in allowing any body to choose opinions for them; that there are no marks by which it can be decided beforehand, what opinions are true and what are false; that there must, therefore, be equal freedom of declaring all opinions, both true and false; and that, when all opinions, true and false, are equally declared, the assent of the greater number, when their interests are not opposed to them, may always be expected to be given to the true. These principles, the foundation of which appears to be impregnable, suffice for the speedy determination of every practical question.\n\nAll censure thrown upon the government, all censure thrown either upon the institutions of the government, or upon the conduct of any of the func-\nLiberty of the Press.\n\ntionaries of government, supreme or subordinate, has a tendency to produce resistance to the government. Of the censures thrown upon government, some may have a tendency to produce resistance to the operations of government in detail; others to produce that general resistance which has in view some great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the government.\n\nOf the first sort would be any such accusation of the conduct and disposition of a judge, as might excite the people, whose sympathies were roused in favour of the individual against whom his sentence was to operate, to rescue him from the officers of justice. We have already shown that such a rescue ought to be punished, and any direct exhortation to it ought to be punished. It will now be evident, we trust, that no censure on the judge, though capable of being treated as an indirect exhortation, ought to be punished.\n\nThe reason is conclusive. The people ought to know, if possible, the real qualities of the actions of those who are entrusted with any share in the management of their affairs. This they have no chance of knowing, without the unlimited power of censure upon those actions, both in gross and detail. To see the full force of these propositions, it is only necessary to apply the principles which have been already established.\n\nIf the people have not the means of knowing the actions of all public functionaries, they have no security for the good conduct even of their representatives. Suppose it is the duty of their representatives to watch the conduct of the judges, and secure the perfection of judicature, the people cannot know whether their representatives perform their duty, unless they know what the conduct of the judges is. Ignorance of this would of itself suffice to vitiate the government. A door would be left open, through which the rulers might benefit themselves at the expense of the people. All the profit to be made by an abuse of the power of justice, would thus become the profit of the representatives, by whom it would be allowed, and encouraged as far as the knowledge, which they could not withhold from the people, would permit.\n\nThat the people ought, therefore, to know the conduct of their judges, and when we say judges we mean every other functionary, and the more perfectly the better, may be laid down as indubitable. They are deprived of all trust-worthy means of knowing if any limit whatsoever is placed to the power of censure.\n\nAll censure consists in the delivery of an unfavourable opinion, with or without the grounds of it. This is the essence of censure. But if the conduct of the judge deserves that an unfavourable opinion should be entertained of it, the more perfectly that is known to the people the better.\n\nThe conduct of the judge, on this occasion, says a defender, does not deserve an unfavourable opinion: A public expression of such an opinion ought, therefore, to be prohibited. But the conduct of some judge, on some occasion, deserves an unfavourable opinion. When it is deserved, there is no security for good government, unless it is allowed to be made known. How can you allow an unfavourable opinion to be delivered in the one case, and not delivered in the other? To have the benefit of it in the one case, you must submit to the evil of it in the other.\n\nAs the real point of importance is, to establish correct opinions in the minds of the people, it is as mischievous to inculcate a favourable opinion, when an unfavourable is deserved, as an unfavourable when a favourable is deserved; and, in the eye of reason, it is incontrovertible, that, if the one deserves to be prevented by punishment, so does the other. But, if an unfavourable opinion is pronounced of any public functionary; of a judge, for example, would you have it left uncontradicted? Would you not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> the liberty of calling in question the truth of the allegations, and of supporting a different opinion? In that case, it is abundantly evident, that the character of no public functionary would be safe, and that any man, however deserving, might be made to appear the proper object of the most unfavourable sentiments.\n\nIt is perfectly certain, that it is not in the power of law to mark out, by antecedent definition, any sort of men, of whom it can say, all opinions favourable to such men shall be punished. It can never be affirmed of any men beforehand that they will certainly perform such and such injurious actions. If they do perform them, all declarations conformable with the matter of fact are good. But the question is, whether they have performed them? One man affirms that they have. Is that to be taken for granted? And is no man to be allowed to affirm the contrary, and to sift the grounds upon which the allegations of the other man are supported? It is by weighing well the evidence on both sides, that a well-founded opinion is capable of being formed. This is perfectly certain. It is equally certain, that the best security for having the evidence on both sides fully adduced, and the strength and weakness of it perfectly disclosed, is by permitting all those who are attached to different opinions to do what they can for the support of their own.\n\nIf it is evident that it ought not to be permitted to speak evil of public functionaries without limit, while any limit is put to the power of speaking well of them; it is equally evident that, for the purpose of forming a correct opinion of their conduct, it ought not to be permitted to speak well of them, and oppose any limit whatsoever to the power of speaking ill of them. It ought not to be permitted to speak evil of them without an equal liberty of speaking well; because, in that case, the evidence against them might be made to appear much stronger than it was. It ought not to be permitted to speak well of them without an equal liberty of speaking ill; because, in that case, the evidence in favour of them might be made to appear much greater than it really was. In either case, the people would be misguided, and defrauded of that moral knowledge of the conduct of their rulers, the paramount importance of which has so fully appeared.\n\nIt may be said (as by the short-sighted, if we did not anticipate them, it would be said), that if, by limiting the power of censure, the people are made to judge more favourably of their rulers than they deserve, the evil is small; but if they are permitted to\nLiberty of form a very unfavourable opinion, the consequences are alarming.\n\nWe believe it may be rigidly demonstrated, that no evils are greater than those which result from a more favourable opinion of their rulers, on the part of the people, than their rulers deserve; because just as far as that undue favour extends, bad government is secured. By an opinion of their rulers more favourable than they deserve, is implied an ignorance on the part of the people of certain acts of their rulers by which the people suffer. All acts by which the rulers have any motive to make the people suffer, are acts by which the rulers profit. When the ignorance of the people extends to material <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, all the evils of bad government are secured. These are the greatest of all possible evils. To this it will not be said that the ignorance of the people ought to extend. On all material points, it is admitted, then, that the freedom of censure ought to be complete. But if it is to be allowed on great points, on those where it is calculated to exact the greatest disapprobation, what can be thought of their consistency who would restrain it on those where it is only calculated to excite a small? If it is proper to protect the people from great injuries at the hands of their rulers, by exciting a strong, it is good to protect them against small injuries by exciting a weak disapprobation.\n\nTo public functionaries may be imputed either acts which they have not performed, or a want of certain qualifications, moral or intellectual, which they do possess.\n\nWith respect to acts, and even dispositions, which do not, either directly or indirectly, concern their public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, the same protection may be safely extended to them as to private men.\n\nActs in their public capacity which they have not performed, may be imputed to them either by mere forgery, and without any appearance of ground, or they may be imputed with some appearance of ground. From permitting the former, no good can be derived. They ought, therefore, to be prevented, in the same way as false imputations, injurious to individuals in their private capacity. That there should be no restraint in imputing actions to any public functionary which he may appear to have done, flows immediately from the principles already established, and requires not that anything should here be added to its proof. Any appearance sufficient to lay the foundation of the slightest suspicion, renders it useful to call the attention of the public to the suspected part, which can only be done by making the suspicion known. A man may, indeed, publish, as a matter of fact, what is supported by appearances which would only justify the slightest suspicion. In that case, he is sure of incurring the disgrace of temerity, if not of malignity; and this is all the penalty which needs or can safely be inflicted upon him.\n\nIn imputing inaptitude to a public functionary, on the score either of intellectual or moral qualities, scarcely any limitation would be safe. Every man ought to have liberty to declare upon this subject any opinion which he pleases, and support it by any evidence which he may think adapted to the end. If, in supporting his opinion of the inaptitude of any public functionary, he imputes to him actions which there is not even an appearance of his having performed, that limited prohibition, the propriety of which we have just recognised, will strictly apply. With this exception, freedom should be unimpaired.\n\nWe have now, therefore, explained, we hope sufficiently, in what manner the principles which we have established require that the use of the press should be regulated in speaking of the action of public functionaries, and their fitness for the duties which they are appointed to discharge; whether those functionaries are the immediate representatives of the people, or others whom it is the business of their representatives to control.\n\nWe have next to inquire in what manner those principles require that the use of the press should be regulated in speaking of the institutions of government. The illustrations already adduced will supersede the use of many words upon this part of the subject.\n\nInstitutions of government are good in proportion as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the people from evil, whether it be evil created by the government, or not prevented by the government. Institutions of government are bad in proportion as they are the cause of evil to the people, either by what they create, or fail in preventing.\n\nAccording to this statement, which it is impossible to controvert, institutions of government may, in strict propriety of speech, be said to be the cause of all the evil which they do not save the people from, and which any other institutions would save them from.\n\nIt is therefore of the highest importance that the people should know what are the institutions which save them from the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of evil, and how much their own institutions want of being conformable to those best institutions.\n\nInstitutions of government are bad, either because those in whose hands the powers of government are placed do not know that they are bad, and though willing, cannot improve them; or they are bad, because those who have in their hands the powers of government do not wish that they should be improved.\n\nWhere the rulers are willing, but do not know how to improve, every thing which leads to a knowledge of these defects is desirable to both rulers and people. That which most certainly leads to such knowledge is, that every man who thinks he understands any thing of the subject, should produce his opinions, with the evidence on which they are supported, and that every man who disapproves of these opinions should state his objections. All the knowledge which all the individuals in the society possess upon the subject is thus brought, as it were, to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> stock or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, while every thing which has the appearance of being knowledge, but is only a counterfeit of knowledge, is assayed and rejected. Every subject has the best chance of becoming thoroughly understood, when, by the delivery of all opinions, it is presented in all points of view; when all the evidence upon both sides of every question is brought forward, and all those who are most interested in showing the weakness of what is weak in it, and the\nLiberty of the Press.\n\nstrength of what is strong, are, by the freedom of the press, permitted, and by the warmth of discussion excited, to devote to it the keenest application of their faculties. False opinions will then be delivered. True; but when are we most secure against the influence of false opinions? Most assuredly when the grounds of these opinions are the most thoroughly searched. When are the grounds of opinions most thoroughly searched? When discussion upon the subject is the most general and the most intense; where the greatest number of qualified persons engage in the discussion, and are excited by all the warmth of competition, and all the interest of important consequences, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the subject with the deepest attention. To give a body of rulers, or any other body of men, a power of choosing for the rest opinions upon government without discussion, we have already seen, upon good evidence, is the way to secure the prevalence of the most destructive errors.\n\nWhen institutions are bad, and the rulers would gladly change them if they knew they were bad, discussion, it will not be disputed, would be good for both parties, both rulers and ruled. There is, however, another case, and that by far the most common, where the rulers are attached to the bad institutions, and are disposed to do all in their power to prevent any alteration. This is the case with all institutions which leave it in the power of them who are entrusted with the powers of government, to make use of them for their own advantage, to the detriment of the people; in other words, which enable them to do injury to the people, or prevent the people from good. This is the case with by far the greater number of those institutions by which the people suffer. They are institutions contrived for benefiting the few at the cost of the many.\n\nWith respect, therefore, to the greater number of defective institutions, it is the interest of the rulers that true opinions should not prevail. But with respect to these institutions, it is of still greater importance to the people that discussion should be free. Such institutions as the rulers would improve, if they knew that they were defective, will be improved as the rulers themselves become sensible of their defects. Such defective institutions as the rulers would not wish to see improved, will never be improved, unless the knowledge of these defects is diffused among the people, and excites among them a disapprobation which the rulers do not think it prudent to disregard.\n\nThat the prevalence of true opinions among the people, relative to those defects in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> institutions, by which the rulers profit at their expense, is of the utmost importance to the people, is therefore a proposition which no improbity will dare openly to controvert. That freedom of discussion is the only security which the people can have for the prevalence of true opinions has already been proved. It is therefore proved that freedom of discussion, in its utmost perfection, they ought to enjoy.\n\nWhat is included in the term freedom of discussion, is evident from what has already been said.","sp":553,"ep":566},{"h":"LINCOLNSHIRE","t":"an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">Extent</a> and boundaries.

The largest of these, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINDSEY\">Lindsey</a>, is more extensive than the other two, containing more than 1,000,000 acres, and stretching from the shores of the German Ocean to Nottinghamshire. It is rather an elevated tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, but the whole so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> as scarcely to contain a single hill. The north-eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is a very extensive district of heathy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, generally very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, especially the northern part of it, and denominated the Wolds.\nThough some parts of it have recently been brought into cultivation, yet a great portion has scarcely any other live stock than the numerous rabbits, which multiply in extended warrens. A small part, however, of this division, contains a rich tract of low land, formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a>, and Idle, where horned cattle are pastured, and some excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> is produced. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Lindsey is subdivided into fifteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> and two sokes.\n\nThe province of Kesteven extends along the western side of the county, from its middle to its southern extremity; on which latter part is a portion of the fens. Notwithstanding there are many extensive heaths, especially near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCASTER\">Ancaster</a>, and though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and elevation is various, yet, on the whole, it may be properly described as a fertile country. Towards the west, a ridge of hills, which forms an abrupt boundary, extends from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANTHAM\">Grantham</a> nearly to Lincoln; but none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> attain a great elevation. This province is subdivided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hundreds and three sokes.\n\nThe third province, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, contains the greater part of that unhealthy division of Lincolnshire usually called the Fens. It is subdivided into three hundreds, sometimes denominated Sokes, sometimes Warentakes. The character of this province is similar to the province of the same name in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>, after which it has been called. Nearly the whole of it appears, at a remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, to have been covered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and only brought to its present state of productivity by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and persevering labour of the inhabitants. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-EMBANKMENTS\">embankments</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> have been expensive, perpetual, and progressive, and the soil that has been redeemed has conferred a most abundant remuneration. Excellent pasture land has been formed out of the swamps and bogs, and some of it produces extraordinary crops of corn, especially oats. Even in those parts that have not been reclaimed, the reeds, which abound, are converted into good covering for houses and barns, and they are well stocked with aquatic wild fowl. The taking of them is a profitable employment to many persons, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> are principally supplied from thence with those delicacies. The decoys in this district are more numerous than in any other part of England. They are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> formed around quiet pools, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> made of bent willows, and covered with nets, gradually enlarging as they approach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, are conducted. Into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> orifice of the pipes, the wild birds are enticed by tame ones trained for that business, and who conduct them into the funnel, when the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> or his dog behind, drives them to the most contracted part, where they are taken. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of birds taken in some seasons is prodigious, amounting to some hundreds of thousands. They usually consist of teal, widgeon, and wild ducks, but occasionally wild geese, godwits, coots, ruffs, and reeves and whimbrels are caught. In these otherwise unproductive fens, the keeping of geese, principally for the sake of the feathers, is a considerable branch of rural industry, and supplies a large part of the demands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, both for beds and for pens.\n\nThe feathers are plucked from the birds at three, four, sometimes five different periods in the course of a year. This is thought to be a barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> is denied by the breeders, who assert, that, for their own profit, they pluck only those feathers which are so near falling off as to occasion little pain; those more firmly fixed, and which have some portion of blood at their end, being of very inferior value. The young ones are plucked as well as the old ones; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> having taught that, when plucked early, the future growth of the feathers becomes greater. During the breeding season, the birds are lodged in the same houses as their owners, in wicker pens, which are arranged in rows, frequently in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-chambers. A gooseherd in attendance on the flock leads them daily to water, and assists them, on their return, to get into their several cells. The attendants are acquainted with each individual goose in the flock, and can commonly distinguish them by the tones of their voices. Near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPALDING\">Spalding</a>, there is a considerable heronry, and a smaller one near Surliefet, where the herons, like rooks, build their nests on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> trees.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in the fens is generally insalubrious, and the inhabitants suffer much from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the water, which is generally of a brackish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; and though they make reservoirs to preserve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> water, in dry summers, they experience very great distress. In warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, vast swarms of insects add to the annoyances of this district.\n\nBy the returns of 1811, the inhabitants of Lincolnshire were 237,891, viz. 117,022 males, and 120,869 females. In the preceding year the baptisms were 3963 males, 3857 females; the deaths 2736 males, and 2784 females. The houses were 47,467, which were inhabited by 50,904 families; of these 29,881 were chiefly employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, 13,184 in trade, and 7839 in neither.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> containing more than 2000 inhabitants are the following:\n\n| Town          | Houses | Inhabitants |\n|---------------|--------|-------------|\n| Lincoln (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>)| 1839   | 8861        |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a>        | 1837   | 8180        |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAINSBOROUGH\">Gainsborough</a>  | 1227   | 5172        |\n| Lowth         | 1035   | 4728        |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMFORD\">Stamford</a>      | 820    | 4582        |\n| Spalding      | 944    | 4330        |\n| Grantham      | 683    | 3646        |\n| Holbeach      | 617    | 2962        |\n| Great Grimsby | 668    | 2747        |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HORNCASTLE\">Horncastle</a>    | 571    | 2622        |\n| Barton        | 486    | 2204        |\n\nThe towns whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> is betwixt 1000 and 2000 are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLEAFORD\">Sleaford</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROWLAND\">Crowland</a>, Bourn, Swineshead, Dennington, Epworth, Crowle, Brigg, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALFORD\">Alford</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAINFLEET\">Wainfleet</a>, Kirton-in-Lindsey, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAISTOR\">Caistor</a>.\n\nLincolnshire returns twelve members to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, viz. two for the county, two for the city of Lincoln, and two for each of the boroughs of Boston, Grantham, Great Grimsby, and Stamford.

The Foss Dike, the earliest canal made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, was constructed in the year 1121, to form a connection between the city of Lincoln and the river Trent; and though, from the nature of the soil, it has been often obstructed, and the expense of keeping it in order has been great, it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be used from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The river Trent, though rising in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, may be considered as a Lincolnshire river, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> upon it belonging to this county. It receives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUN\">Dun</a> and the Ouse, and, before reaching the sea, unites with the Humber. It is navigable for large barges to Gainsborough. It has, on the influx of the tide, a most extraordinary bore, or, as it is provincially termed, eager, when the waters run up resembling a wall with a rapidity that has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> equal in any of our English rivers, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WYE\">Wye</a> at Chipstow. The Witham rises within the county, about ten miles from Stamford. The early part of its course is through a beautiful district till it reaches the fen country, when its course becomes sluggish; but being navigable to Boston, is highly beneficial both for draining and for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. The other rivers are the Anholme, the Welland, the Glen, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">Grant</a>, and the Ouse. The Humber, indeed, is its boundary on part of the northern side, but is more commonly and properly considered as a Yorkshire than a Lincolnshire river, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HULL\">Hull</a>, its principal port, being in that county. Two small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> communicate with the river Witham, one from Horncastle, the other from Sleaford.\n\nThe great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> or estuary into which the different rivers and dikes that drain the fens are disembogued, is very shallow, and filled with drifting sands, that make the approach to the shore highly dangerous. The rivers are constantly loaded with mud, and, in times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, encounter the tide, equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with its floating silt, which causes a stagnation and deposit that is constantly shifting its position, as the strength of the rivers or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> happen to be the most powerful.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the country in the fens is generally uninteresting, exhibiting extensive plains, with nothing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the continuity of the line of vision, and only rendered less monotonous by the vast numbers of cattle with which the green meadows are covered. On the wolds a more bleak and dreary prospect presents itself, but the western division of the country, near Stamford and Grantham, is variegated, woody, and undulating, and presents generally pleasing pictures.\n\nAgriculture. The agriculture of the fens is of the simplest kind; for where nature has created such a productive soil, little remains to be done by the operations of man. In the more elevated parts of the county the cultivation is conducted with various, but, on the whole, good judgment; and the land produces ample crops of wheat, oats, barley, and beans, and, in some parts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> and flax. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, however, of the whole county is more turned to derive profit from cattle than from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>.\n\nThe oxen of Lincolnshire are proverbial for their goodness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> were of a great size, with large heads and short horns, thick in the bone, deep in the belly, short on the neck, high on the rump, and bare on the shoulders; but these have been improved by such various and judicious crossings of breeds, that their symmetry and excellent qualities render them the best in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. Many cattle bred in other countries are fattened here on the rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> pastures, but a portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-cake is very commonly given, to fit them earlier for the market of Smithfield, to which numerous droves are weekly dispatched. This fattening of cattle for the supply of London is so advantageous, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> is almost everywhere considered as a secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>.\n\nThe sheep of this county are almost peculiar to it. They are of a large size, have horns, and produce heavy fleeces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, highly prized in the manufacture of stuffs and some kinds of baizes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> is, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in flavour, and, unless the animals are improved by crossing with other races, is not generally relished. As the foundation of an excellent breed, they were selected by the late judicious Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKEWELL\">Bakewell</a>, who, from mixing them with other races, produced those excellent sheep known by the name of \"new Leicesters.\" The fleeces of the pure Lincolnshire sheep in general weigh from ten to twelve pounds, but extraordinary instances have been known in which they have attained more than twenty pounds.\n\nThe live stock, in which this county exceeds every other, is rabbits, which the numerous warrens on the wolds produce in vast numbers. From their prodigious quantity the flesh is of small value, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of the skins for the use of the furriers and hatters is the principal source of profit. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of warrens has considerably diminished of late years, and the land they occupied appropriated to tillage; but they are still very extensive.\n\nLincolnshire is not a manufacturing county: before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of machinery, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> of their native wool gave occupation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> part of the population, but that employment has been nearly discontinued of late years, and no other has yet been substituted in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. In some parts the flax is spun for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> use. The nature of its seashores operate to prevent foreign commerce, and there is little or no intercourse between Lincolnshire and the ports even of Holland and Germany, that are opposite to it. The county produces neither minerals nor coals.\n\nThe antiquities of Lincolnshire are numerous. Almost all the churches are fine specimens of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, a singularity which distinguishes them from those in every other county of England.\nremains of Crowland, founded in 716, the seat of a Mitred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBOT\">Abbot</a>, and anciently a place of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, are still visited by every antiquary; and near them, is the triangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over three streams, in good preservation. It is, however, so lofty and precipitous, that it is only useful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and foot travelers, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> under it. The other most prominent antiquities are Torksey Castle, at the junction of the Foss Dike with the Trent; Thornton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>, near the Humber; Bardney Abbey, on the banks of the Witham; Tattershall Castle, on the same river; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMERTON\">Somerton</a> Castle, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Boothby.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Burleigh, Lord Bolingbroke, Stukeley the Antiquarian, and Wesley, the founder of Methodism, were, among many other eminent men, natives of this county.\n\nThe most remarkable seats of noblemen and gentlemen are, Blankney, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Chaplin, Esq.; Brocklesby <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, Lord Yarborough; Coleby <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Lindsey; Gautby, Robert Vener, Esq.; Ginsthorpe Castle, Lord Gwydir; Hanby Hall, Sir Wm. Manners; Harmston, Sam. Thorold, Esq.; Hainton Park, G. Heneage, Esq.; Nocton Park, Earl of Buckinghamshire; Belton House, Lord Brownlow; Normanby Hall, Sir J. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEFFIELD\">Sheffield</a>; Reevesby Abbey, late Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks; Sabton, Sir Robert Heron; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">Summer</a> Castle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Wrey; Syston, Sir John Thorold; Thurgunby, Lord Middleton.\n\nSee Young's General Agricultural View of Lincolnshire; Brayley and Britton's Beauties of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a>'s Agricultural Survey.\n\nLinlithgowshire, or West-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a>, a county in Scotland, having the Frith of Forth on the north, Edinburghshire, or Mid-Lothian, on the east and south-east, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANARKSHIRE\">Lanarkshire</a> on the south-west, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a> on the west, is situated between $55^\\circ 49'$ and $56^\\circ 1'$ north latitude, and $3^\\circ 18'$ and $3^\\circ 51'$ west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. It is of a triangular form, about 19 miles long on its eastern boundary, and 13 on its western; but at a medium it is only about 7 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and 16 long, according to the Agricultural Survey, and its area is therefore 112 square miles, or 71,680 English acres.\n\nSo large a portion of the surface of this county is either level, or gently undulating, that only a fifth part of it is stated to be unfit for cultivation. Yet a considerable space is occupied by hills. A ridge extends across it from north-west to south-east, of which Cairnpapple, the most elevated point, is about 1500 feet high. The highest ground is in the middle, and towards the west; on the south there is much moor and moss; but the hills for the most part yield good pasturage, and some of them are planted.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, though variable, is not severe. The prevailing winds are from the west, which blow for about two-thirds of the year. According to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the weather, kept at Duddington on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Frith, about the middle of the northern boundary, the greatest number of rainy and snowy days, in any one year, for a period of thirty years, from 1778 to 1808, was 111 (in 1780), and the smallest number 22 (in 1803); but days on which slight showers fell are not included. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in that period was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1785, when the thermometer stood at $87^\\circ$ in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, in a northern exposure. In June 1787, there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> one-sixteenth of an inch thick.\n\nThough there is a great variety of soil in this district, and considerable tracts of gravel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, yet clay is the most general. The better kinds of clay extend over a fourth of the area; but the inferior sorts, incumbent on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> bottom, are still more extensive.\n\nThe only streams of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> are the Almond, Waters, which rises on the border of Lanarkshire, and flows north-east for about 24 miles between this county and Edinburghshire; and the Avon, which forms the western boundary for about 12 miles. Both these rivulets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the Frith of Forth. On the north side of the town of Linlithgow, there is a lake about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> long, and half a mile broad, which contains pike, perch, and cels; and a smaller one on the south, stocked with the same kind of fish. In the parishes of Linlithgow, Ecclesmachan, and Abercorn, are several sulphureous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, and a strong chalybeate is found in the parish of Torphichen; but none of them are much resorted to.\n\nSilver and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> were at one time got in the hills of Minerals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHGATE\">Bathgate</a>, in the parish of Linlithgow, and in the neighbourhood a small vein of silver ore was found several years ago in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a>. Ironstone is wrought occasionally in the parishes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BORROWSTOUNNESS\">Borrowstounness</a> and Carriden. Sandstone, in some places of an excellent quality, prevails along the coast of the Forth, and also in the interior; and there is an inexhaustible store of limestone. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> mineral production is coal, which abounds in almost every part of it, and is wrought in the parishes of Borrowstounness and Carriden on the Forth, in Uphall and Whitburn on the east and south, and in the parish of Bathgate in the middle. An excellent kind of coal has been wrought within these few years near Cultmuir, on the south-western border. The Union Canal, which passes through this county, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> afford the means of transporting the coal of the interior to the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. (See Edinburghshire in this Supplement.)\n\nLinlithgowshire is for the most part divided into estates worth from \u00a3200 to \u00a33000 a-year; but there are a few above, and several below these extremes. In the neighbourhood of the burghs of Linlithgow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEENSFERRY\">Queensferry</a> there are properties of only a few acres. Four of the greatest estates, rented at from \u00a34000 to \u00a310,000, belong to as many noblemen. In 1806, the number of freeholders, entitled to vote in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a member for the county, was 67. The valued rent, taken in 1649, is \u00a375,027, Rental. 12s. 2d. Scots; in 1806, the real rent was \u00a364,518, 18s. 7d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>; and, in 1811, the real rent of the lands and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> was \u00a382,947, 2s., and of the houses \u00a35,798, 8s. Almost half the county is entailed. The principal seats are Hopetoun House, Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEATON\">Seaton</a>; Hopetoun, two miles west of Queensferry; Barnbougle Castle and Livingston House, Earl of Rosebery; Craigiehall, Mr Hope Vere; Duddington, Mr Dundas; Hallyards, Mr Ramsay; Houston, Mr Sharp; Kinneil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, near Borrowstounness; and Polkemmet, Mr Baillie.\nThe size of farms is from 50 Scots acres to 600, but the greater part are between 100 and 300 English acres. The rent of the better soils, which extend over half the county, varies from L2 to more than L5 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>; that of the inferior clays is from 14s. to 20s., and of the high grounds from 6d. to 10d.; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rent of the whole, in 1811, being rather more than 23s. the English acre. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> is 19 or 21 years; but, in some instances, they are for 24, 38, and even 57 years; grazing farms are let on short leases, from one to four years. The crops raised are the same as in the other counties in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of Scotland, which have been already described; and the general system of husbandry is not materially different, except that the dairy is more an object here than in the counties to the east and south-east.\n\nThe towns are Linlithgow, Borrowstounness, and Queensferry; and the principal villages are Whitburn and Bathgate. Linlithgow, the county town, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> burgh, sixteen miles west from Edinburgh, contained, in 1811, 2557 inhabitants. It was formerly a place of considerable trade, but is now in a decaying state. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of the town and parish are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, stockings, malt, and spirituous liquors, calico <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> and tambouring. The standard dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of Scotland were committed to the charge of this burgh, and still bear its name. These are the firiot of 2199 cubic inches for wheat, rye, beans, peas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; and another of 3208 cubic inches for malt, barley, and oats. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">Palace</a>, situated on an eminence overlooking the lake on the north side of the town, was founded by Edward I. of England. The Regent Murray was assassinated on the streets of this town, by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, on 22d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1569. Borrowstounness is a port on the Frith of Forth, eighteen miles west from Edinburgh, containing about 2200 inhabitants, who are partly employed in shipbuilding, and in the manufacture of salt, earthenware, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>.\n\nQueensferry, a royal burgh, is nine miles west from Linlithgow-Edinburgh. The width of the Frith of Forth here is only two miles, with convenient landing-places on either side. (See Queensferry in the Encyclopaedia.) In the middle of the Frith at this place is the small island of Inchgarvie, surmounted by a ruinous fort. The village of Bathgate is eighteen miles west, and Whitburn twenty-one south-west from Edinburgh. Borrowstounness is the only place which carries on some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> commerce, but its trade has declined since the Forth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a> Canal was opened. The chief exports are coal, salt, and soap, and the imports <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, hemp, flax, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> fishery in the Frith is prosecuted with various success; the usual season is from November to February. There is also a salmon fishery on some parts of the coast, particularly between Queensferry and Blackness.\n\nLinlithgowshire sends one member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; and, in the elections for the burghs, the town of Linlithgow unites with Selkirk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANARK\">Lanark</a>; and Queensferry with Stirling, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULROSS\">Culross</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERKEITHING\">Inverkeithing</a>, and Dunfermline. It is divided into twelve entire parishes, and contains portions of other three, the rest of which belong to the county of Edinburgh. With the exception of the parish of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRAMOND\">Cramond</a>, of which only a small part is situated in Linlithgowshire, all these parishes belong to the Presbytery of Linlithgow, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of Lothian and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TWEEDDALE\">Tweeddale</a>. The poor are relieved for the most part by the rents of land and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, the donations of individuals, and from the ordinary funds of the kirk-sessions; but in some parishes poor-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> are raised by assessment. The annexed tables contain an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the census of 1800 and 1811.\n\nSee Beauties of Scotland, Vol. III.; Trotter's General View of the Agriculture of West Lothian, 1811; The General Report of Scotland, and Playfair's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of Scotland, Vol. I.; and for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and antiquities, Chalmers's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALEDONIA\">Caledonia</a>, Vol. II.

Its inventor, Alois Senefelder, the son of a performer at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">Theatre</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> of Munich, was placed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in the University of Ingolstadt, as a student of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>; but, after his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he attempted a theatrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. Not succeeding in this, he became an author, though his poverty prevented him from publishing his works. He now tried many plans with copper-plates and compositions, as substitutes for letter-press, in order to be his own printer. He found, in the course of his experiments, that a composition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, wax, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, formed a good material for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> on his plates; that, when dry, it became firm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, and that it resisted aquafortis. Wanting facility in writing backwards on the plates, he got some pieces of Kilheim stone, as cheap materials, on which he could practise after polishing their surfaces. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> being desired by his mother to take an account of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> about to be sent to be washed, and having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he wrote the account on a polished stone, with his composition ink, intending to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> it at his leisure. When he was afterwards about to efface this writing, it occurred to him that he might obtain impressions from it; and, having eaten away the stone with acid for about the hundredth of an inch, he found that he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> with printing-ink, and take successive impressions. This new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of printing appeared to him very important, and he persevered through all difficulties in applying his discovery to practical purposes, and in improving it.\n\nIn the course of many experiments, he found that it was not necessary to have the letters raised above the surface of the stone, but that the chemical principles by which grease and water are kept from uniting, were alone sufficient for his purpose. This point obtained, Lithography may be said to have been fully discovered. All that was required was the improvement of the materials, and the mode of working with them, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of a proper press for taking the impressions.\n\nThe perseverance with which he followed up his experiments, in order to overcome the difficulties which successively arose in his progress, is astonishing, and the more so, considering the total want of method in his proceedings. Often has he wasted months in surmounting a difficulty which a little knowledge, or a very little reasoning, would have enabled him to conquer immediately. His uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> seems to have been, to try the first thing that came to hand, and so on in succession, till chance rewarded his assiduity by presenting to him the material suited to his purpose.\n\nThe first essays to print for publication were some pieces of music, executed in 1796; afterwards he attempted drawings and writings. The difficulty he had in writing backwards led him to the process of transfer, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of dry soap, which was found to leave permanent traces, which would give impressions, naturally led to the mode of chalk drawings.\n\nHaving made considerable improvements, Mr Senefelder obtained, in 1799, a patent privilege for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, when he made known his process, and afterwards entered into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a> with Mr Andr\u00e9, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OFFENBACH\">Offenbach</a>, who proposed to establish presses, and take out patents at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>. For this purpose Senefelder came to London with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Andr\u00e9's, and the invention having been much spoken of, under the name of Polyautography, most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> English artists made trials of it. Unfortunately, however, the art of printing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> was not then fully understood, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the materials of Germany and those of England, used both for the purposes of drawing and printing, caused constant failures, and the artists in succession abandoned the practice of it. To this cause is to be attributed the unpopularity of Lithography till recently in England, as it was left entirely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of amateurs, whose productions, generally speaking, did no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the art, and whose faults were in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> supposed to be those of the art itself.\n\nIn August 1800, Senefelder, who had now separated from Andr\u00e9, went to Vienna, where, after much difficulty, a patent was obtained, and extensive preparations were made, for applying his process to print cottons; but bad management, and some unfortunate circumstances, prevented his success, and he returned to Munich in 1806, leaving the establishment in other hands.\n\nMr Mitterer, Professor of Drawing at the Public School at Munich, now (1806) practised Lithography.\nto multiply copies for the pupils, and is said to have invented the chalk composition in its present form, or at least to have improved it greatly.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the practice of the art has extended and improved rapidly, and more particularly at Munich, where several establishments were formed, for the purpose of applying it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>, as well as for printing writings and official forms, for the different departments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>.\n\nIn October 1809, Senefelder was appointed Inspector of the Royal Lithographic Establishment at Munich, for printing from stone a complete map and survey of Bavaria; since which period he has devoted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to experiments, and to writing the history of his invention. Among other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of improvement to which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> has been directed, is a substitute for the stones, which are inconvenient to use on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and they are also liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> in the press, when used without due caution, or when they contain flaws. For this purpose he has made a composition of drying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, finely ground <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and other substances, which is thinly spread over pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>; but it has not hitherto been found to answer. The surface cracks after repeated wetting and exposure to the power of the press, and the printing-ink is then taken in the cracks, and spoils the impressions. Thus a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> only of good impressions can be obtained. A public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of printing from this stone paper was made in London, on the 23rd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1821, by a partner of Mr Senefelder; but the result was not such as to induce much confidence in the ultimate success of the trials to form this desirable substitute of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> material for a heavy one.\n\nIn England Lithography can scarcely be said to have been entirely given up since its first introduction in 1800, although it was but little practised or thought of after 1805, till its revival at the latter end of 1817; since then it has been more generally attended to, and some of the establishments having now become well acquainted with the process of printing, specimens have been produced in England equal to those of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nIn France but little was done in lithography till 1815, when it was established at Paris by Lasteyrie, and being taken up by good artists, it soon attained great excellence. About the same time it extended to Russia and other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">DESCRIPTION</a> OF THE MATERIALS, AND THE MODE OF PREPARING THEM.\n\n1. Of the Stones, and the manner in which they are prepared to receive the Drawings.\n\nAs calcareous stones <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> all imbibe grease and moisture, and effervesce with an acid (the use of which will appear when we speak of the process of printing), they are all capable of being used for Lithography. Those are best adapted to the purpose which are very compact, of a fine and equal grain, and free from veins, or imbedded fossils or crystals.\n\nThe quarries of Solenhofen, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPPENHEIM\">Pappenheim</a> in Bavaria, furnished the first plates, and none have as yet been found to equal them in quality. They are of a very uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The fracture is perfectly conchoidal. The beds divide into thin portions of considerable size, with perfectly flat surfaces, and were on this account carried to Munich and other places for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PAVING\">paving</a> kitchens and halls, and thus came in the way of Senefelder, when he discovered the chemical process of printing.\n\nThe stones of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> vary in their quality, but the best are in great abundance. Generally speaking, the hardest are the best, provided they are quite uniform in texture. Such are necessary for fine chalk drawings, softer ones may do for ink, or for coarser drawings in chalk.\n\nIn France, stones have been found near Chateauroux (D\u00e9partement de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDRE\">Indre</a>), of a similar colour to those of Solenhofen, and even harder and of a finer grain, but they are so full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> spots of a softer nature, that it is scarcely possible to get one perfect of a greater size than twelve inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>.\n\nIn England a stone has been used for Lithography which is found at Corston near Bath. It is one of the white lias beds, but not so fine in grain or so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> in texture as the German stone, and therefore far inferior. But it is good for transfers, and does tolerably well for ink drawings or writings. Another stone, found near Stony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATFORD\">Stratford</a>, is also used; but it is of a brownish grey tint, and too dark in colour to show the effect of the drawing with sufficient clearness.\n\nTo bear the pressure used in taking the impressions, a stone twelve inches square should be at least one inch and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> thick. The thickness must increase with the size of the stone, but two inches and a half are a thickness sufficient for stones of three feet by three feet and a half.\n\nThe stones, when sawn to a proper size and thickness, are ground <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> by rubbing two of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> to face with water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and very carefully examined with a straight-edge, to ascertain that they are perfectly level in all directions. This applies only to the side which is afterwards to receive the drawing, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the stone is sufficiently true for the back.\n\nTo prepare them for chalk drawings, two stones, which have been perfectly levelled, are well washed in order to free them from any of the coarser grains of sand which have been previously used upon them. They are now to be placed on a board over a trough, and a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water and very fine sand being strewed over the surfaces, they are to be rubbed face to face, adding occasionally a little fresh sand and water. The best sort of sand in England is that called silver sand, for preparing the stone, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> sand for giving a fine grain. The sands must be passed through a sieve of the fineness required, which will vary with the nature of the drawing; and the greatest care must be taken to have the sieves perfect, and to prevent any coarser particles of sand from being mixed with the rest. A single grain would fill the stone with innumerable scratches, which would all appear in the drawing. The upper stone is in this operation moved in small circles, carefully and equally all over the under one, taking care not to move the one beyond the edge of the other, or the faces would become rounded. When the grain is equal, and sufficiently fine, the stones are carefully\nwashed, and wiped with a clean cloth. The stone, thus prepared, should have, when dry, a perfectly uniform appearance in the colour and grain, and resemble a sheet of vellum. It should be free from scratches, and have no shining parts. The upper stone is always the finer grained of the two.\n\nSometimes dry sand alone is used, but it is better to use it with water.\n\nTo prepare the stones for ink drawings or writings, the process <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described is first followed; they are then well washed to get rid of the sand, and the same operation of rubbing two together is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> with powdered pumice-stone and water. When perfectly smooth, they are again washed, and afterwards separately polished with a large piece of fine pumice-stone with a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. The polish now given to the stone should be such as to show the reflection of objects to the eye placed close to the stone, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> along it towards the light.\n\nWhen a writing or drawing has been fully used, and the stone is to be again prepared, sand is strewed over the surface, and it is sprinkled with water, and rubbed with another stone as before described, till the drawing has disappeared. It must then be washed with aquafortis diluted with twenty times its bulk of water. This is absolutely necessary to destroy the lines, which would otherwise partially re-appear in printing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> drawing from the same stone. After this the stone is again prepared for a new drawing with fine sand in the manner before described.\n\nInk drawings sink deeper into the stone than the chalk, and require the stone to be more ground away to efface them. The longer drawings remain on the stone, the deeper the ink or the chalk penetrates.\n\n2. Lithographic Ink and Chalk.\n\nFor these materials the union of several qualities is required, and as no single substance possesses them all, it is necessary to combine several substances together.\n\nLithographic Ink.\n\nA great many different receipts have been given, but as only two sorts are wanted, namely, one for writing on the stone, and one for transfer, it will be sufficient to give one of the most approved of each kind, and to point out the cause of any defect, with the means of remedying it. These defects are generally to be attributed to some fault in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>.\n\nComposition of Lithographic Ink for Drawing on the Stone.\n\n| Tallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> | 2 oz. |\n|---------------|------|\n| Virgin wax    | 2 oz. |\n| Shell lac     | 2 oz. |\n| Common soap   | 2 oz. |\n| Lamp-black, about one-twentieth of the whole. |\n\nThese materials are prepared in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> saucepan with a cover. The wax and tallow are first put in and heated till they ignite; while they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the soap must be thrown in in small pieces, one at a time, taking care that the first is melted before a second is put in. When all the soap is melted, the ingredients are allowed to continue burning till they are reduced one-third in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>. The shell lac is now added, and as soon as it is melted, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> must be extinguished. It is often necessary in the course of the operation to extinguish the flame, and take the saucepan from the fire, to prevent the contents from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> over; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, after the process above described, any parts are not completely melted, they must be dissolved over the fire without being again ignited.\n\nSometimes a larger proportion of wax is used, when only half of the soap is put in, and the burning goes on till the quantity is reduced one-half. The remainder of the soap is then added over a fire which keeps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> melted without igniting it.\n\nIf the ink, in this state, is broken when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, the pieces should adhere very slightly when pressed together between the fingers. If it works between the fingers like wax, it must be again burnt for a short time; if it is too brittle, and the broken parts will not adhere at all together by pressure, some more soap must be added in a second burning.\n\nIt should now dissolve, though with difficulty, by rubbing with warm water. The lamp-black, of the finest quality, must now be mixed with it, which is done while it is melted over a slow fire, adding small portions of the black at a time, and stirring them well together. The black increases its solubility for use, but too much is detrimental. When complete, it should, in its fracture, have the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> ink, though it is softer. When the black is mixed with it, it must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> on a marble slab and pressed with a heavy weight. The following rules for remedying defects in the ink are given by M. de Raucourt in his Manuel de la Lithographie, which is the most useful book yet published on the subject. It has been translated into English by Mr Hullmandel.\n\nDefects of the Ink.\n\nThe ink is not soluble.\n\nRemedies.\n\nAdd soap.\n\nIt is soft and attaches itself to the fingers.\n\nBurn it more.\n\nSome time after dissolving it in water it becomes thick and slimy, and requires a continual addition of water in order to be enabled to draw with it.\n\nThis is the defect of almost all inks; it proceeds from its not being sufficiently burnt. Burn it more.\n\nThe ink is not compact, and is full of bubbles.\n\nIt has been cast too hot on the marble slab; cast it again when it is less hot, and lay a heavier weight upon it.\n\nBoth these defects may proceed either from its being too much burnt, or from its containing too much black; in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, add equal portions of wax and soap, and melt on a slow fire.\n\nKeeping in view the principles here pointed out, any one can, after a few trials, make good Lithographic ink.\nInk for Transfers.\n\nThis is composed of the same materials as the preceding, but must be less burned. It will therefore be softer, and it must also be afterwards melted and mixed with a little more wax and thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, such is described hereafter in speaking of the printing inks.\n\nLithographic Chalk.\n\nThis should have the qualities of a good drawing crayon, it should be even in texture, and carry a good point. It is, however, difficult to avoid making it too soft and greasy on the one hand, and too brittle on the other. For the chalk, as for the ink, more or less of the soap, wax, and tallow, may be used as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the burning may render necessary, and the remedies pointed out for defects of the ink will enable the operator to judge of what is wanting.\n\nThe following proportions are the best:\n\n- Common soap, 1 1/2 oz.\n- Tallow, 2 oz.\n- Virgin wax, 2 1/2 oz.\n- Shell lac, 1 oz.\n\nThe manipulation is similar to that for the ink. It is well, however, to throw in a little of the wax just before the flame is extinguished. Less black must be mixed with the chalk than with the ink, its only use being to colour the drawing, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> may see the lines he traces.\n\nWhen the whole is well mixed, it should be poured into a mould, and very strongly pressed to prevent any bubbles, which would make the texture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>.\n\n3. Mode of Drawing.\n\nWith these materials the artist proceeds to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the prepared stone, taking care first to wipe the stone with a clean dry cloth. The ink being rubbed with warm water like Indian ink, is used on the polished stone; and it is to be observed, that a gradation of tints can be obtained only by varying the thickness of the lines, and the distance at which they are placed apart; as the line traced by the ink being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and unbroken throughout, receives the printing ink all over. Hence it follows, that the artist cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> any advantage by diluting the ink for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> tints of the drawing, as the printing ink will take equally upon all the lines, and at once render all of them equally black. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the artist is to mix the ink to that consistency, which, while it works freely, shall yet be strong enough to stand perfect through the process of printing. A consistency, a little stronger than writing ink, is sufficient for this purpose.\n\nThe chalk will not hold upon the polished stone.\n\nThe grained stone, prepared for chalk, being carefully wiped to free it from dust, must be drawn upon with the crayon as common drawing chalk is used on paper. The subject may be traced on the stone with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> chalk, but care should be taken to do this very lightly, so as not to fill up any of the grain of the stone. In drawing, the degree of pressure of the hand will vary the strength of the tint, and it is desirable to give the requisite strength at once; as the surface of the stone is a little altered by receiving the chalk, and hence it does not take any additional lines with the same equality. Practice is necessary to give a command of the material, as it does not work quite like the common crayon, there being great difficulty in keeping a good point. There is also much difficulty in obtaining the finer tints sound in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>; and for the light tints, it is necessary to put the chalk in a reed, as the metal port-crayon is too heavy to draw them, even without any pressure from the hand; and therefore the artist cannot draw them with freedom, as his touch will be unsteady, by being obliged to support the pencil from the stone.\n\nIt is necessary to observe the grain with which the stone is prepared, which should vary with the fineness of the drawing. Several pieces of chalk should be prepared to use in succession, as the warmth of the hand softens it.\n\nIt is useful to cut the chalk to the form of a wedge rather than a point, as it is less likely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> in that form.\n\nSmall portions of the point will break off during the drawing; these must be carefully removed with a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>.\n\n4. Printing Press and Roller.\n\nThe best sort of printing press for Lithography is represented in Plate XCV, the drawings being taken from one used by Mr Hullmandel.\n\nFig. 1. Is a side elevation of the press, with the scraper partly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>.\n\n2. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> through the middle.\n\n3. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plan of the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>.\n\n4. Detail of the manner in which the scraper is held down during the impression.\n\n5. End elevation of the press.\n\n6. To explain the manner in which the centre of motion of the scraper is raised and lowered.\n\nThe press consists of a strong frame, having on the upper part a platten, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, a, to receive the stone, and which is moved along grooves in the upper part of the frame by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>-wheel, b, to the axle of which is fixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, c. On this cylinder the straps, dd, are gathered, which work over the pulleys, e, fixed to the bed.\n\nWhen the stone is placed on the bed, and ready for the impression, the frisket, or cover, f, of the bed, is brought down from the position marked by the dotted outline in fig. 1, and shut over the stone, as shown in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. This cover consists of a strong piece of calf's skin, stretched by screws with nuts and hooks, which catch hold of an iron rod sewed along one end of the skin. The other end of it is fixed to the opposite end of the frame. (See fig. 3.) The cover is fixed to the bed by hinges, g, which can be screwed at different heights, according to the thickness of the stones. When the cover is opened, it rests against the frame, h, which can be adjusted to different heights. (See figs. 1 and 5.)\n\nThe cross piece, i, having the scraper, k, fixed in it, is now brought down, and the catches, l, lock into the upper part of the piece, n, sliding between the grooved upright, m. This is shown more in detail in fig. 4, the upper part, where the catches lock, is of iron, and has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> and handle to pull it out.\nwhen the scraper is to be unlocked. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, o, keeps it generally in an upright position to be ready to hold the catches, h.\n\nWhen the scraper is locked down, the printer sets his foot on the treadle p of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, which presses the scraper with great power on the stone. The pressure is by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> lever, having a connecting rod, q, which can be adjusted so as to bring the upper arm r nearer to the treadle, when an increase of pressure is required, or a thinner stone is placed on the bed, which makes it necessary to bring the scraper lower down. The arm r passes through an iron frame on the sliding piece n, and thus brings it down when the treadle is depressed. The hook s holds down the treadle during the impression.\n\nThe star-wheel b is now turned round, and by this motion the bed is drawn under the scraper, and the impression is taken. The bed passes over a roller, t, which is placed with its centre directly under the scraper. See fig. 2.\n\nAs the stones are not always of the same thickness, the scraper must be brought to different heights. Fig. 6 shows an adjusting screw for the purpose of regulating the end farthest from the catches, there being a sliding piece between the grooved uprights, u, in which the centre is fixed, on which the cross piece i turns. The iron v, fig. 2, stops the cross piece and scraper from falling back.\n\nWhen the bed has been drawn out, the printer releases the treadle, which is raised up by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> weight, w, and the scraper being unlocked and thrown back, the bed is drawn to its first position by the weight, x.\n\nAs the surface of the stone is not always quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the bed, a simple contrivance has been adopted to allow a self adjustment of the scraper, which is allowed to turn on the centre, and pressed down by a spring acting on each end, but yielding if necessary at either. It is shown by the dotted lines in fig. 2. The screw y presses the scraper lower, or raises it if required.\n\nThe scrapers are made of beech wood.\n\nThe Roller.\n\nThe roller for inking the drawing is of the form represented, Plate XCV. fig. 7. The length may vary, but it ought to be full four inches in diameter. It is covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a>, rolled tightly three or four times round, and nailed at the ends. It is then covered with a stretched calf-skin, fitting quite tight. The seam must be made neatly with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOOT\">boot</a>-maker's closing stitch. The ends of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> are gathered with a string, and tied round the projecting ends of the roller. Loose handles A, A, made of thick leather, are put on these ends when it is used. The leather must be put on the roller with the rough side outwards.\n\n5. Printing Ink.\n\nThe printing ink is composed, as other printing inks are, of oil, varnish, and very fine lamp-black, well mixed together. To prepare the varnish, a saucepan is about half filled with pure linseed oil, and heated over a fire, till it ignites from the flame of a piece of burning paper. It should then be allowed to burn till it is reduced to the degree required; and if, during the operation, there appears danger of its boiling over, it must be immediately taken off the fire, and the cover, which ought to fit quite close on the saucepan, must be put on to extinguish the flame. This is to prevent accidents; and the operator cannot be sufficiently cautioned against the danger attending the burning of the varnish, which ought never to be performed in a room with a boarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, or indeed in any part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. Wet sacks are the best things to put out the flame in case of accident.\n\nSeveral inks must be prepared, differing in the degree of viscosity, or thickness of the varnish from which they are made, and the quantity of black mixed with them. The longer the oil is burned, the thicker the varnish becomes.\n\nThe thinnest varnish is burned till it has lost nearly one-fourth of its volume.\n\nThe next till it is reduced one-third.\n\nThe thickest till it is reduced one-half.\n\nThese directions are to be considered as very general ones; and the state of the varnish is best judged of during the burning, by taking out some with a spoon, and letting a drop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on a cold earthenware plate, and trying its degree of viscosity with the finger. The thinnest sort should be like common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, the other should draw out in strings, which will be longer as the varnish is thicker. The thickest will draw out in strings two or three feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>.\n\nIt is quite essential to have the oil pure, and the saucepan perfectly clean, and to keep the varnish in clean close jars in a cool <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\nIt is best not to make the varnish long before it is wanted; for if any decomposition takes place in it, the drawing will be spoiled by the printing ink.\n\nThe black is mixed with the varnish on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> stone with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">muller</a>, in small successive quantities; care being taken that the first portion of black is equally mixed with the varnish before a second is added. In the thickest inks this requires considerable labour.\n\nBy mixing the varnishes together, any degree of stiffness of the ink may be obtained; and by putting more or less black, its thickness is regulated.\n\nThe printer must always have by him several small pots, each containing a different printing ink, to be used as occasion requires. A small quantity, not more than the size of a hazel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>, should be used at a time, for it is desirable to charge the roller with as small a quantity as possible. It must be worked well on the colour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> with the roller in all directions, that it may be equally distributed all over the roller.\n\nInk drawings are generally printed with a stiffer ink than chalk drawings.\n\n6. Preparation of the Stone for Printing.\n\nThe drawing being finished on the stone as before described, is sent to the Lithographic printer, on whose knowledge of his art the success of the impressions entirely depends. The first process is to etch the drawing, as it is called. This is done by placing the stone obliquely on one edge over a trough, and pouring over it very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> nitric acid. It is poured on the upper part of the stone, and runs down all over the surface. The stone is then turned, and placed on the opposite edge, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETCHING\">etching</a> water,\nbeing collected from the trough, is again poured over it in the same manner. The degree of strength, which is little more than one per cent. of acid, should be such as to produce a very slight effervescence; after the etching water has lain on the stone for a second or two, its strength must vary according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; and the degree of fineness of the drawing. It is desirable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the etching water two or three times over the darkest parts of the drawing, as they require more etching than the lighter tints. Some stones also, and different chalks, require different degrees of strength of the acid, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> alone can guide the Lithographer in his practice on this point. Chalk drawings require weaker acid than the ink.\n\nThe stone is now carefully washed, by pouring clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-water over it, and afterwards with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-water; and when not too wet, the roller, charged with printing ink, is rolled over it in both directions\u2014sideways, and from top to bottom, till the drawing takes the ink. It is then well covered over with a solution of gum-arabic in water, of about the consistency of oil. This is allowed to dry, and preserves the drawing from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, as the lines cannot spread, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the pores of the stone being filled with the gum. After the etching, it is desirable to leave the stone for a day, and best not to leave it more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, before it is printed from. In some establishments a few proofs are taken immediately after the drawing is etched, but it is better not to do so.\n\nThe operation of the etching requires great nicety, and must be done quickly. If the drawing is etched too strongly, the fine tints disappear; if too weak, the printing ink mixes with the darker parts, and the drawing runs into blots. A soft stone requires weaker acid than a hard one, if they are equally pure in quality. The differences in the composition of the stones also require differences in the strength of the etching water, so that no strict rules can be given.\n\nThe effect of the etching is, first, to take away the alkali mixed with the drawing chalk or ink, which would make the drawing liable to be affected by the water; and, secondly, to make the stone refuse more decidedly to take any grease. The gum assists in this latter purpose, and is quite essential to the perfect preparation of the surface of the stone.\n\n7. Printing.\n\nWhen the stone is to be printed from it is placed on the bed or platten of the press; at this time a proper sized scraper for the printing is very carefully adjusted to the surface of the stone. The gum on the stone is now sprinkled with rain-water, and being gradually dissolved, and a wet sponge passed lightly all over it, the printer works the ink which is on the colour table placed beside him, with the roller in all directions till it is equally spread and thinly all over the roller. He then (the stone being wet) passes the roller all over the stone in both directions, observing (as his experience enables him to do) that all parts of the drawing take the ink in due proportion. The roller should be applied with an equal motion and pressure, which must be regulated according to the mode in which the drawing takes the ink; if it does not take it readily, the pressure must be increased, and the roller moved more slowly.\n\nThe roller should turn freely as it passes over the stone; if it slips, the cause is either that the stone is too wet, or that too much of the gum remains upon the stone; in the first case, a drier sponge will correct the evil; in the second, the stone must be again washed with a little water; but this must be done with caution, as the gum should not be entirely washed off the stone.\n\nAt first the drawing receives the ink with some difficulty, and it is frequently necessary to wet the stone and roll it in several times, before it will take the ink readily. Care must now be taken not to wet the stone too much; the less dampness the better, provided it is sufficient to keep the stone from taking the ink in the parts where there is no drawing; at all events, no drops of water should be seen on the stone, as they spoil the printing ink, and also are imbibed by the roller, which therefore becomes unfit for use. After the drawing is thus rolled in, the sheet of paper is placed on the stone, and the impression taken in the manner described in the account of the press. When, after the impression, the paper is taken up, the stone appears dry, the moisture having been imbibed by the paper. It must be again wetted with a damp sponge, and rolled in with ink as before, taking care to work the roller well on the colour table each time before applying it to the stone.\n\nGenerally the first few impressions are imperfect, from the drawing not taking the ink fully, but this is gradually corrected.\n\nDuring the printing some gum must always remain on the stone (though it will not be visible), otherwise the ink will take on the stone, and also spoil the drawing. If, by too much wetting or by rubbing too hard with the sponge, the gum is entirely removed, some fresh gum-water must be laid on. If the stone has, in the first instance, been laid by with too small a quantity of gum, and the ink stains the stone on being first applied to it, gum-water must be used to damp the stone instead of pure water. Sometimes, however, this may arise from the printing ink being too thin, as will appear below. If some spots on the stone take the printing ink, notwithstanding the above precautions, some strong acid must be applied to them with a brush, and after this is washed off, a little gum-water is dropped on the place. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> point is here frequently necessary to take off the spots of ink.\n\nThe edges of the stone are very apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and generally require to be wiped with an old sponge or rag after the rolling in. They must also frequently have an application of acid and gum, and sometimes be rubbed with pumice-stone.\n\nChalk drawings are much the most difficult to print.\n\nAfter this general description of the printing, the following development of the principles on which it is regulated, and notice of the difficulties which arise in its progress, will be found useful.\n\nAn ink which is too thin, and formed of a varnish not sufficiently burned, will soil the stone, notwithstanding the proper precautions are taken of wetting the stone, and preparing it properly with acid and gum.\n\nInk which is too stiff will tear up the lighter tints of the chalk from the stone, and thus destroy the drawing.\n\nThe consideration of these circumstances leads us at once to the principles of the printing. These\naccidents arise at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> points of the scale at which the printing inks can be used, for it is evident, that the only inks which can be employed are those which are between these points, that is, thicker than that which soils the stone, and at the same time thinner than that which takes up the drawing. Lithographers are sometimes unable to print in very hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, the reason of this may be deduced from the above. Any increase of temperature will diminish the consistency of the printing ink; the stone will therefore soil with an ink which could be safely used at a lower temperature; hence a stiffer ink must be used. Now, if the temperature should increase so much that the stone will soil with any ink at all less thick than that which will take up the drawing, it is evident that the printing must cease till a cooler temperature can be obtained; for, as the drawing chalk is affected equally with the printing ink, the same ink will tear up the drawing at the different degrees of temperature.\n\nThis, though it sometimes occurs, is a rare case; but it shows that it is desirable to draw with a chalk or ink of less fatness in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> than in winter; and also, that if the printing-room is in winter artificially heated, pains should be taken to regulate the heat as equally as possible.\n\nWe will now enumerate some other difficulties which are not referable to the above general principle.\n\nIf the pressure of the scraper is too weak, the ink will not be given off to the paper in the impression, although the drawing has been properly charged with it. Defects will also appear from the scraper being notched, or not correctly adjusted, or from any unevenness in the leather or paper.\n\nInequalities in the roller will cause the drawing to receive the ink unequally, and if the roller or its leather is too hard, it will not ink the drawing clearly.\n\nAfter printing a considerable number of impressions, it sometimes happens that the drawing takes the ink in dark spots in different parts. This arises from the printing ink becoming too strongly united with the chalk or ink of the drawing, and if the printing is continued the drawing will be spoiled. A little consideration will show us the reason of this accident. The printing ink readily unites with the drawing, and being of a thinner consistency, it will by repeated applications accumulate on the lines of the drawing, soften them, and make them spread. In this case it is necessary to stop the printing, and let the stone rest for a day or two, for the drawing to recover its proper degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. If the drawing should run smutty from any of the causes before enumerated, the following mixture will clean it:\n\nTake equal parts of water, spirits of turpentine, and oil of olives, and shake them well together in a glass phial, until the mixture froths, wet the stone, and throw this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> upon it, and rub it gently with a soft sponge. The printing ink will be dissolved, and the whole drawing also will disappear, though, on a close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, it can be distinguished in faint white lines. On rolling in again with printing ink, the drawing will gradually reappear as clear as at first.\n\nAccidents sometimes occur in the printing, from the qualities of the paper. If the paper has been made from rags which have been bleached with oxymuriatic acid, the drawing will be incurably spoiled after thirty impressions. Chinese paper has sometimes a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>; this is so fatal as sometimes to spoil the drawing after the first impression.\n\nWhen the stone is to be laid by after printing, in preserving order that it may be used again at a future period, the drawing must be rolled in with a preserving ink, called by Senefelder, Aetzfarbe, as the printing inks would, when dry, become so hard, that the drawing would not take fresh printing ink freely. The following is the composition of the preserving ink.\n\n| Thick varnish of linseed oil | 2 parts |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Tallow                      | 4 do    |\n| Venetian turpentine         | 1 do    |\n| Wax                         | 1 do    |\n\nThese must be melted together, then four parts of lamp-black very carefully and gradually mixed with it, and it must be preserved for use in a close tin box.\n\nVery good effects are produced in Lithographic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>, by printing from two or more stones with different coloured inks. This is managed by preparing a composition of\n\n| Wax | 2 parts |\n|-----|--------|\n| Soap| 1 do   |\n\nA little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>.\n\nMelt them in a saucepan, and cast them into sticks. This must be rubbed up with a little water to the thickness of cream, and applied to the surface of a polished stone. An impression is taken in the common way from a drawing, and applied to a stone prepared in this manner, and passed through the press, taking care to mark, by means of this impression, two points in the margin corresponding on each of the stones. The artist having thus on the second stone an impression from the first drawing to guide him, scrapes away the parts which he wishes to remain white in the finished impression. The stone must now be etched with acid stronger than the common etching water, having one part of acid to twenty of water. The whole is then washed off with turpentine.\n\nThis plan has been very much followed at Munich. It is generally used to print a middle tint from the second stone. The black impression being given from the first stone, a flat transparent brownish tint is given from the second, and the white lights are where the paper is left untouched. The dots are necessary to regulate the placing of the paper on the corresponding parts of the two stones.\n\nThe coloured inks for the tints are differently made, according to the tint required, but the varnishes alone make very good light browns.\n\nThe paper for Lithographic Printing should not be so damp as for Copperplate Printing.\n\n8. Different manners of Lithography.\n\nBesides the manners already described of drawing with ink and chalk, Lithography is practised in various other ways.\n\nTransfers.\n\nThe most useful of these is the transfer, before alluded to in speaking of the inks, as it saves the labour and inconvenience of writing backwards. This is performed by writing with the composition ink on a prepared paper, and then transferring the writing to a stone, by passing it through the press.\nThe paper is prepared as follows. A paste is made by dissolving, with heat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a> in water till its consistency is such as to fix like a thin jelly when cold. It must then be mixed with gamboge and a little alum, in the following proportions:\n\n- Glue: 6 parts.\n- Gamboge: 1 do.\n- Alum: 0\u00bd do.\n\nThese must be mixed together over a fire, and applied while lukewarm in a thin coating on one side of a sheet of soft or unsized paper, which, when dry, must be rubbed over with a little powdered gum-sandarac. The writing is to be made with the fatter sort of ink on the prepared side.\n\nWhen the transfer is to be made, a polished stone is warmed to about 130\u00b0 Fahrenheit, and placed in the press. The paper is then carefully damped at the back with a sponge, and placed between some sheets of soft paper. It is next placed on the stone with the writing towards it, and passed through the press as in printing an impression. This must be repeated four or five times without raising the leather cover of the bed of the press; beginning with a slight pressure at first, and increasing it every time. The press is now to be opened and the paper taken off, when the writing will appear to have come off the paper on the stone. If necessary, the paper may be a little dampened, to raise it from the stone, but it should be done with care.\n\nWhen the stone is quite cold, it is etched and prepared for printing in the usual manner.\n\nThis mode is of great use for circular letters and written forms, but does not do so well for works of art, as the lines lose their sharpness by spreading a little at the edges, from the warmth of the stone. To obviate this, Senefelder has proposed a fatter ink, which may be taken off on a cold stone.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">Imitation</a> of Wood Cuts.**\n\nThis is a very easy mode, though not much practised. A polished stone is covered all over with lithographic ink, and the parts which are to be left white are scraped away with a steel point. Very fine lines are most easily obtained by putting them in with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> pencil. The stone is etched as before described.\n\n**Etchings on Stone.**\n\nA polished stone is prepared for this mode by washing it with diluted acid as weak as the water used for etching a drawing; and after that is washed off, and the stone is dry, it is to be covered with weak gum-water and a little lamp-black. This forms a coating to the stone, and the artist works on it with an etching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, as in etching on copper. The lines he traces appear white, but look stronger than they will appear afterwards. The stone should be a little warmed, for the needle to work freely through the coating, and care must be taken not to breathe upon it. When the etching is finished, the surface is to be rubbed all over with linseed oil, which penetrates into the lines drawn by the needle. After this the coating is to be all washed off with water.\n\nIn this mode lines can be drawn as fine as on copperplate; it is, however, but little practised in England, though it is often employed in Germany.\n\nThe great distinction of Lithography from Engraving is, that it gives a fac-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> drawing, which retains all the freedom and touch of the artist's own hand; while, on the contrary, an engraving must be a copy. This character in a lithographic print arises from the facility with which the drawing is produced; as the process is exactly that which the artist would follow in making a common drawing; and the farther advantage of a great saving of expense is derived from the same cause; for the drawing being made at once on the stone, the whole expense of the engraving is saved. This is particularly the case with drawings in chalk, or with outlines or slight works in ink; and thus the door is opened to the production of many works which could not otherwise be published on account of the expense of engraving.\n\nThe more finished drawings in ink, however, have not the same advantages, for the gradations in tint can be obtained only by the variations in the breadth and distance of the lines, which is the same principle as that on which the engraver works; and hence the labour is more nearly equal in the two methods.\n\nIt must be admitted, that there is much less difficulty, and consequently less education, required to draw the lines on the stone than to cut them on the copper, but no superiority is obtained in the impression; nor is there any other advantage attending the substitution of the stone for the copper than a saving of expense, which, from there being but few artists who have practised this mode of Lithography, is not considerable at the present time.\n\nThe number of impressions which can be taken from a chalk drawing will vary according to the fineness of the tints. A fine drawing will give 400 or 500; a strong one from 1000 to 1500.\n\nInk drawings and writings give considerably more than copperplates. The finest will give \u00a3600 or 8000, and strong lines and writings many more. Upwards of 80,000 impressions have been taken at Munich from one writing of a Form for regimental returns.\n\nIf, however, we compare lithographic prints with fine line engravings, or more particularly with engravings in Mezzotinto, we shall observe, that the latter are more rich in their effect, and that the shadows have, in some places, more depth and brightness. This is in part obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> deeply into the copperplates, so as to lay on in the impression a mass of ink of a rich and deep black colour in the parts where it is wanted to increase the effect, and by this means the engraver extends the limits of his tints. Lithography will, perhaps, always remain inferior in this respect to line and mezzotinto engraving, as the principle on which it is founded is to print from the surface only. Some of the modes of engraving, such as soft ground etching and aquatint, are inferior to Lithography.\n\nSuch may be said to be the present state of Lithography; but it must be recollected, that it is as yet but a new art, and doubtless susceptible of great improvement. It is very much in want of the attention and practice of better artists, who would not only produce better performances with the present materials, but would also be able to point out in\nLONDON. Since the article London in the Encyclopaedia was written, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the British Empire have proceeded with a rapidity equal, if not superior, to what has been witnessed at any former period.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, or that part properly called London, the increase of buildings and their improvement have not proceeded with an equal pace to what have been exhibited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, and the other adjuncts, which form a large portion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. The private dwellings have been, indeed, much improved and augmented, principally in the environs of Moorfields, and the site which was formerly occupied by the buildings of Bedlam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a> are now (1821) about to be covered with good dwellings. The most extensive public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> recently erected within the city is the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM_HOUSE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">Custom</a>-house, with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> to the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. It is upon a much larger scale than the building destroyed by fire in 1812; its interior is far better arranged for the dispatch of business, and the simple elegance of its front is an addition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the banks of the river. The clearing away the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and vulgar erections which covered the legal quays between the Custom-house and London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a> will, when completed, add much to the beauty of that part of the banks of the Thames.\n\nThe New Mint, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east side of Towerhill, has been completed, and displays much simplicity and taste; but from being crowded by surrounding buildings, its full effect is lost. Though attention has been paid to the exterior of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, yet its great excellence consists in the curious, valuable, and accurate machinery by which its operations are effected; for a full account of which, we refer to the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COINAGE\">Coinage</a> in this Supplement. The inconveniences of the situation, and of the scattered buildings which form the General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">Post</a>-Office, have been long subjects of complaint, and at length <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> have been taken for erecting a new Post-Office on a regular plan, in a more central part of the metropolis. A piece of ground situated between St Martin's le <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> and Forster Lane, at the north-west corner of Cheapside, has been selected for the purpose, and the houses and warehouses which stood upon it have been purchased and pulled down; by which a good access to Aldersgate Street, and the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> from the city, has been formed. The work is at present languishing on account of some differences between the Corporation of London and the Postmaster-General. The estimate of the value of the ground and buildings to be purchased was made to be \u00a3240,000; but the actual expenses incurred on those purchases has already exceeded that sum; and \u00a387,000 more is required to complete the payment for the whole of the ground and houses. An application was made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> in July 1820, for the additional sum of \u00a3100,000. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> to whom the petition was referred did not approve of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, and, in consequence of this state of affairs, the operation must remain suspended, till some new plan for supplying the pecuniary means is adopted by the Legislature. The Prison in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">Poultry</a>, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">Counter</a>, has been removed. A new and more commodious edifice has been constructed near Cripplegate, capable of containing 250 delinquents, to which the prisoners have been removed, and the site of the ancient building is now covering with a spacious dissenting chapel. Among the public edifices of an inferior kind within the city that merit notice, may be mentioned the new house built on Moorfields for the London Literary Institution, to which its valuable library and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> have been removed. Near to it, on opposite corners of what is intended to form a new square, a very sumptuous Roman Catholic chapel, and an elegant chapel for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> of seceders from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> of Scotland, have been built, the effect of which on the whole of that mass of buildings will be very good, when the plan is completed. The ancient building originally appropriated for a cloth market, known as Blackwell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, is now pulling down, and the corporation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> building on the spot a range of offices for the Commissioners of Bankrupts, and for other purposes. One of the most striking improvements, because in Holborn, the broadest of all the streets in the city, is that which has been recently effected by removing the cumbrous front of Furnival's Inn, and replacing it with a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> pile, covered with Bernasconi's composition, which has the appearance of Portland stone. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-WATERLOO\">Waterloo</a> Bridge, Southwark Bridge, and Vauxhall Bridge, have all been completed, and opened for the public. As the particulars of their construction have been amply detailed in this work under the article Bridge, we must refer to it; only adding, that, from want of advantageous approaches, the tolls collected at Waterloo and Southwark Bridges are very inadequate to pay any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> on the capital that has been expended. The ruinous condition of London Bridge has been a subject of complaint for many years, and a Committee of the House of Commons has been appointed, to investigate and report on its present condition, and on the steps necessary to be taken to remove the inconveniencies suffered as well by those who pass over as by the barges and boats that sail under it. Among the improvements to the facilities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of London must be noticed the docks of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> (see the article Docks); the West India and London Docks, and the admirable commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> leading to the two former, by which the goods from those deposits are conveyed to the warehouses in the city. Though not strictly speaking a part of London, yet the East Country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOCK\">Dock</a>, and the Surry Canal, on the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Thames, form a vast addition to the facilities of the metropolis, and are now in a complete state to receive shipping. Though the private dwelling-houses within the city...\ndo not appear to have increased in number within the last ten years, nor have the number of windows increased, yet the value of them must have become considerably greater, as the house tax has advanced from L.86,200, in 1810, to L.103,442, in 1820.\n\nThe improvements in Westminster that have been made, or that are now (1821) in progress, are very numerous and extensive, both as regards the public erections and the dwellings of individuals. The new churches, whose erection has commenced since the vote of Parliament has destined a large sum to that object, have contributed much to increase the beauty of Westminster. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> church of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>-le-Bone, begun independently of the assistance of government, has been completed, and exhibits a very striking specimen of the architectural taste of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Many others are in a state of great forwardness; but, as these new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> want the elegant towers which arise from the churches built by Sir Christopher Wren, they present, at a distance, less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of magnificence than the buildings of that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>. The completion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>-house and of the adjoining arcade has formed one part of the many additions that have been recently made, and are still proceeding, in the vicinity of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Carlton House. Among them the most striking are Regent Street and Place, terminating with the splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSURANCE\">insurance</a>-office which faces the palace. A circular street of uniform houses, with balconies supported by lofty pillars, sweeps round the insurance-office, and connects itself, at the northern extremity, with the magnificent piles of buildings on both sides of a new and wide street, which crosses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> Street, and terminates in the Regent's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>. When this plan shall be completed, the mass of buildings will present a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of private dwellings far superior to any thing that is to be seen in any of the other capitals of Europe. The new squares and the streets connected with them which have recently been constructed in the parishes of Mary-le-bone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PADDINGTON\">Paddington</a>, especially Montague and Brianston Squares, exhibit neat and elegant dwellings on spots either disfigured previously by being receptacles of the filth of the metropolis, or by houses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> and dirty appearance. The estate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a> has been covered with handsome streets, and that of the Foundling Hospital, near it, is now converted into Mecklenburg Square and several new streets. On the south-western side of the metropolis the same spirit of building is displayed, and Tott-hill-fields is being covered with houses, whilst towards Chelsea, between Grosvenor Place and Sloane Street, the ground is marked out for the construction of spacious squares and wide streets. These improvements do not, however, appear to have increased the number of the dwellings. In fact, the smaller houses have given place to larger; one of which, in many instances, has occupied the space formerly covered by several. The space covered by houses has thus been extended, and the number of streets increased, rather by the demolition of small courts and alleys, and by the new being larger than the old habitations, than by any remarkable augmentation in the number of residences. There cannot, however, be a doubt, that the improvements have tended much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the inhabitants of this extended metropolis.\n\nThe portion of the metropolis usually comprehended under the name of Southwark, though it forms no part of that borough, but is within the parish of Lambeth, has partaken of the general spirit of improvement which is displayed in the other portions of the capital. The most remarkable public building is that of Bedlam, a massy pile, constructed with great regard to the nature of the malady of those for whom it is destined, and not destitute of architectural taste. The Cobourg Theatre for performing musical pieces, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">Asylum</a> for the Destitute, and the School for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAF_AND_DUMB\">Deaf and Dumb</a>, are among the new public edifices, whilst several streets have been either built, or are now building, connected with the new bridges.\n\nThe annexed table exhibits an account of the number of houses charged to the window and inhabited house duties, with the amount of the duties in London, Westminster, and Southwark, for the years 1810, 1812, 1814, 1816, and 1818.\n\n| Year | Places       | Number of Houses charged to Window-Duties | Amount of Duty thereon | Number of Houses charged to Inhabited House-Duties | Amount of Duty thereon |\n|------|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 1810 | London       | 14,473                                    | L.138,884              | 17 11                                            | 14,380                 | L.86,207 18 7 |\n|      | Westminster  | 18,518                                    | 183,332                | 14 2                                             | 18,518                 | 137,261 7 9 |\n|      | Southwark    | 5,655                                     | 17,826                 | 13 6                                             | 5,431                  | 10,935 10 11 |\n|      | London       | 14,175                                    | 136,985                | 6 6                                              | 14,175                 | 86,836 12 6 |\n| 1812 | Westminster  | 18,086                                    | 178,462                | 2 3                                              | 18,080                 | 141,722 5 7 |\n|      | Southwark    | 5,744                                     | 17,070                 | 16 0                                             | 5,380                  | 11,773 16 1 |\n|      | London       | 14,195                                    | 135,457                | 6 6                                              | 14,193                 | 97,364 0 6 |\n| 1814 | Westminster  | 18,152                                    | 177,077                | 10 10                                            | 18,152                 | 146,252 18 9 |\n|      | Southwark    | 5,750                                     | 16,930                 | 14 1                                             | 5,251                  | 11,842 18 10 |\n|      | London       | 14,079                                    | 133,931                | 5 2                                              | 14,037                 | 102,426 1 6 |\n| 1816 | Westminster  | 18,019                                    | 173,222                | 12 6                                             | 18,019                 | 145,247 2 10 |\n|      | Southwark    | 5,809                                     | 16,634                 | 8 7                                              | 5,241                  | 11,987 5 10 |\n|      | London       | 14,070                                    | 132,451                | 15 11                                            | 14,069                 | 103,442 18 1 |\n| 1818 | Westminster  | 17,665                                    | 179,188                | 13 1                                             | 17,656                 | 148,659 11 3 |\n|      | Southwark    | 6,464                                     | 17,837                 | 18 4                                             | 5,808                  | 13,464 15 2 |\nThe introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> lights into the streets, coffee-houses, and shops, has added much to the brilliant appearance of the metropolis at night. An incorporated company has hitherto furnished this substance, and is now increasing its establishments, whilst a new corporate body has been formed for the farther extension of this mode of lighting. Some late improvements, by which the gas may be produced from oil instead of coal, will tend to lessen the cost of the machinery, to simplify its preparation, and to adopt it for more general, if not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use.\n\nThe consumption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> may be considered as fair a criterion as any other, of the increase or decrease of the prosperity of a city. In London coal is almost exclusively used for firing, and, with the exception of a small portion brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a> by the Grand Junction Canal, passes through the Custom-house, whose return of imports is as follows:\n\n| Years | Chaldrons of Coals | Chaldrons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULM\">Culm</a> |\n|-------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1810  | 1,102,747         | 1344             |\n| 1811  | 1,109,873         | 3929             |\n| 1812  | 1,066,287         | 7842             |\n| 1813  | 1,020,187         | 4653             |\n| 1814  | 1,119,788         | 1896             |\n| 1815  | 1,144,363         | 4272             |\n| 1816  | 1,217,433         | 5815             |\n| 1817  | 1,149,871         | 3879             |\n| 1818  | 1,203,707         | 4738             |\n| 1819  | 1,170,618         | 9479             |\n| 1820  | 1,321,905         | 4461             |\n\nThe general state of the foreign trade of the port Foreign of London may be gathered from the following table, Trade, which shows the number and tonnage of British and foreign ships that entered inwards and cleared outwards from and to all parts of the world (exclusive of coasters) since the conclusion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\n\n| Year | Ships | Tons | Ships | Tons | Ships | Tons | Ships | Tons |\n|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|\n| 1814 | 2,773 | 549,307 | 2,297 | 269,834 | 2,248 | 433,099 | 2,193 | 285,816 |\n| 1815 | 2,718 | 546,727 | 1,747 | 275,375 | 2,442 | 526,021 | 1,940 | 310,084 |\n| 1816 | 2,607 | 542,374 | 792 | 115,463 | 2,448 | 506,453 | 780 | 129,722 |\n| 1817 | 3,526 | 671,700 | 881 | 131,647 | 2,663 | 530,270 | 907 | 143,339 |\n| 1818 | 4,455 | 785,473 | 2,198 | 272,656 | 2,974 | 588,819 | 2,008 | 269,585 |\n| 1819 | 3,704 | 698,736 | 1,048 | 158,882 | 2,685 | 516,655 | 1,143 | 184,960 |\n| 1820 | 3,774 | 699,130 | 856 | 122,619 | 2,589 | 522,573 | 789 | 122,505 |\n\nWhilst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a> of the city of London has been left to the care of the municipal magistrates, all of the aldermen being justices of the peace, the vast increase of the suburbs has rendered it necessary to have establishments of a permanent nature in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> to prevent depredations, to detect offenders, and to protect the laws and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the industrious and peaceable. These police offices, which have been of late years increased, are established in Bow Street, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a> Street, Hatton Garden, Worship Street, Whitechapel, Shadwell, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s Square, Westminster, and Union-hall, in Southwark. To these must be added the Thames police, having hulks in different parts of the river, fitted up as occasional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>, from whence boats are manned, which row as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> boats through the night in the whole extent of the river, to watch the property on board the different vessels, and on the wharfs that border the water. The principal police office, that in Bow Street, is under the superintendence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, with a salary of \u00a31,200 per annum, who is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and of two other magistrates with salaries of \u00a3600 per annum. There are three clerks at salaries of from \u00a3150 to \u00a3300 per annum. The officers are eight in number at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> per week, of whom three have an additional salary of \u00a3200 per annum each, for attendance on the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. There are thirteen conductors of the patroles at 5s. per night, and eighty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> men under their orders and inspection, at 2s. 6d. per night each. The whole expense of this office amounts to about \u00a312,000 annually. The other seven offices are upon a lower establishment than that of Bow Street; consisting of three magistrates, with salaries of \u00a3600 per annum each, of two clerks, and a less number of constables and patroles. The expences of them vary from \u00a33200 to \u00a33700 each annually. The Thames police office has three presiding magistrates at \u00a3600 per annum each, two clerks, seventeen river surveyors, forty-three river constables, five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> constables, and a few inferior persons. The expence of this valuable branch of the police amounts to about \u00a37000 per annum. The remaining division of the police of the metropolis is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> patrol; a body of mounted and armed men, who pass the nights in parading the different roads in the vicinity of the metropolis. The numbers of this body are now about to be augmented, and the whole establishment to be placed on an ex-\ntended and improved principle. The expense of this department has usually been from \u00a36000 to \u00a38000 per annum; but what the increase may be under the new system about to be put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> cannot at present be ascertained. The important branch of the police, which consists in licensing public-houses, is conducted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> magistrates, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> gratuitously; and to them, at the petty sessions, is committed the superintendence of churchwardens, of overseers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, of surveyors of the highways, and of the appointment of constables; whilst, at the quarter-sessions of the counties that touch upon the metropolis, the trials of offenders of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> description are allotted.\n\nThe returns of crimes and punishments in the city of London and the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> are combined, so as to be incapable of being exhibited separately; and those in Southwark and the hundred of Brixton, in the county of Surry, though they form a portion of the metropolis, and contain one-fifth of its inhabitants, are not separately stated in the Parliamentary Reports, but are included generally in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the crimes and punishments on the Home Circuit of the Judges.

nearly completed; and the experiment is fairly in progress to ascertain the practicability of producing reformation in offenders by a rigid seclusion from the scenes and companions of their crimes, by constant and regular employment, by the aid of moral instruction, and by the prospect of terminating their imprisonment at an earlier period, as a reward for their good conduct during confinement.\n\nThe plan of the institution is calculated for the reception of 1000 prisoners, viz. 600 males, and 400 females; but from the whole of the building not being completed, the numbers, when the last report was laid before Parliament (30th May 1820), were only 180 males, and 213 females. It is expected by the committee, that the whole will be completed in the year 1821. The utility of instruction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> is considered, by the committee, to be evinced in the moral improvement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> impressions which the prisoners have received. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this, they have given the numbers of those who, at their own request, have been admitted to the holy sacrament, amounting, in 1819, to 40 males, and 89 females; and at Easter 1820 to 143.\nThe establishment of officers for the Penitentiary is upon a footing nearly equal to what will be necessary when the building shall contain the full complement of 1000 prisoners. The only additions that will be required will be some few inferior turnkeys, matrons, and taskmasters.\n\nThe whole amount of expenses, from the 1st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> to the 31st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1819, was L.16,023 3 10\n\nFrom which are to be deducted the following sums:\n\nAmount of stores remaining on hand in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a>'s department on 31st December 1819, L.1030 14 4\n\nAmount of stores in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>'s department, 1135 19 10\n\nMonies received and outstanding for work done by the prisoners out of the prison, 2057 1 6\n\nValue of the work done by the prisoners for the use of the establishment, 1894 7 5\n\nTotal value of the labour of the prisoners in 1819, L.2196 14 8\n\nAs an encouragement to industry among the prisoners, an exact account is kept of all the work they perform; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> are divided in the following proportions, and the prisoners, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of their confinement, are paid what is due to them on that account:\n\nThree-fourths, or fifteen shillings in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, or ninepence in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> to the establishment.\u2014One-eighth, or two shillings and sixpence in the pound, or three halfpence in the shilling to the prisoner.\u2014One twenty-fourth, or tenpence in the pound, or one halfpenny in the shilling to the master manufacturer, or the matron of the females.\u2014One twenty-fourth, or tenpence in the pound, or one halfpenny in the shilling to the task-master or task-mistress.\u2014One twenty-fourth, or tenpence in the pound, or one halfpenny in the shilling to the turnkeys and the assistant task-master or mistress, to be equally divided among them. Those prisoners who are appointed to the inferior offices of the prison, or are employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> occupations, are entitled to one-fourth of their earnings, the officers having no per centage on their labour.\n\nThe daily allowance of food for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> prisoners is one pound and a half of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and six ounces of meat, on four days of each week, with a less proportion for females and boys. On the days when no meat is allowed, a portion of broth is distributed, and every evening a pint of hot gruel or porridge is dispensed to them.\n\nFrom the marshy nature of the ground on which the building was erected, much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> was entertained that it would be injurious to the health of the residents, but the reports of the committee have dispelled such fears. From February 1819 to February 1820, only three deaths occurred, one of which was from fever, and two from consumption. No case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a> had presented itself since the commencement of the establishment, and, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the last report to Parliament, not a single patient in the infirmary was confined to his bed. This healthy state of the prisoners is, by the committee, ascribed to the wholesomeness of the food, to the comparative regularity of their habits, as well as to the warm, though coarse, clothing with which they are supplied, and the care taken of them during sickness.\n\nThe number of fires which take place annually in London, so vast a city, and the losses and deaths thereby occasioned, present a curious subject of inquiry. The only information upon this subject that we have been able to procure, is contained in the Minutes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">Evidence</a> taken before the Parliamentary Committee appointed to inquire into, and report upon the state of the Police of the Metropolis. \"It was lately stated in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a> in the newspapers,\" says Mr Wilkinson, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> examined by this Committee, \"that in the last twelve years six millions of property have been destroyed by fire: I thought it a large estimate, but I mention it to the committee, because it is among the few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> that I have upon the subject. I have met with another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a> with regard to the number of fires that are yearly in London; it is an extract from an article in the Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for 1807, by a person who says, 'That the Insurance Companies calculate upon an alarm of fire every day, and eight very serious fires every quarter; and from Michaelmas 1805 to Michaelmas 1806, the different fire offices in London experienced three hundred and six alarms of fires, attended with little damage; thirty-\none serious fires, and one hundred and fifty-five alarms, occasioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHIMNEYS\">chimneys</a> being on fire; amounting in the whole to four hundred and ninety-two accidents in the course of twelve months. Having given some idea of the quantity of property destroyed in London by fire, as far as I was able, I now beg leave to state the loss of lives:\u2014It was stated lately in the papers that seventy lives were lost in the last twelve years, of course limiting the observation to the metropolis. In order to obtain some idea of the number of lives that have been lost in the last eleven years more particularly, I examined the Gentleman's Magazines, which I thought a good book of reference, and I now state the numbers that suffered from 1806 to 1816. In 1806 five persons suffered, three of whom were children; in 1807 six persons suffered; in 1808 one person was killed, and one was injured; this was the year in which Drury-lane was burnt, and twenty-four persons suffered by an accident, the ruins falling in upon them; in 1809 four persons were killed; in 1810 ten persons were killed, and three injured; in 1811 three persons were killed, and one injured; in 1812 none, at least none appeared in the Magazine; in 1813 five were injured; in 1814 three were killed; in 1815 fifteen were killed, and one injured; in 1816 four were killed, and eight injured; making a total of seventy persons killed and seriously injured from 1806 to 1816. I have no doubt but several were omitted in the account, for of course they did not profess accuracy as to the number of accidents by fire where persons suffered.\u2014After some consideration on the subject, it is my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that annually in London there are upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> thirty-five serious fires, and that property to the amount of L.100,000 is annually destroyed, and that there is a loss annually of five lives. I have made numerous inquiries as to the number of wilful fires in London, and every one seems to concur in the idea that one-half of the serious fires are occasioned by incendiaries. I beg leave further to state, that upon no occasion has any fire-escape been used at a fire, though I have no doubt, had proper fire-escapes been used, but many lives would have been saved.\"\n\nThe number of Newspapers published in London is as follows: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> and six daily evening journals. Seven papers are published three times a week. The London Gazette, and two journals in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, are published twice in each week. The number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> papers is at present seventeen, and there are eleven other weekly papers. Two journals are published weekly, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> design is to criticise and give extracts from new literary works. The whole number of copies of the different journals that are distributed every week, is calculated to be about five hundred and seventy thousand.\n\nThe last accounts presented to Parliament, relative to that splendid national establishment the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>, furnish the following results:\n\nReceipts of all kinds, including Parliamentary grant of L.10,000, for the year ending 25th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1821, L.11,789 2 9\n\nPayments of all kinds for the year ending as above, 10,699 8 6\n\nLeaving a surplus in hand, applicable to the expenses of the year ending 25th March 1822, of L.1,089 14 3\n\nThe number of persons admitted to view the Museum, from 27th March 1820 to 25th March 1821, was 612,543.\n\nIncluding those parts of Surry usually termed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a> part of London, the population, according to the returns made to Parliament in 1811, was 1,009,546. By the returns from several districts of the metropolis which we have seen, under the census now in course of being taken, it appears that the increase in the last ten years has been at the rate of rather more than 15 per cent.","sp":573,"ep":591},{"h":"LUC","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of great merit and celebrity, born at Geneva, 8th February 1727, was the son of James Francis de Luc, descended from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> who had emigrated from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUCCA\">Lucca</a>, and settled at Geneva, in the fifteenth century.\n\nHis father was the author of some very respectable publications in refutation of Mandeville, and other sceptical writers; and he had the means of giving his son an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, although he found it convenient to establish him in a commercial engagement, which principally occupied the first forty-six years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, without any other interruption than that which was occasioned by some journeys of business into the neighbouring countries, and a few scientific excursions among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>: during these, however, he collected by degrees, in conjunction with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> William Antony, a splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERALOGY\">mineralogy</a> and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> in general, which is still preserved at Geneva by the younger Deluc, his nephew. He took, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, his share of the public business of the state, as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of 200, and he is still remembered with respect by his fellow citizens, though he revisited them but once, and that for a few days only, after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a>, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of some unexpected misfortunes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. He bore them with fortitude, and he rather rejoiced than lamented at the change of his pursuits, when he removed to England in 1773. He was made a Fellow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> in the same year, and was appointed Reader to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>; a situation which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to hold for forty-four years, and which afforded him both leisure and a competent income. In the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his life he obtained leave to perform several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOURS\">tours</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and Germany; in this last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> he passed six years, from 1798 to 1804; and after his return he undertook a Geological Tour through England. When he was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a>, in the beginning of his German Tour, he received the compliment of being appointed Honorary Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOLOGY\">Geology</a> in that University; but he never entered on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> duties of a professorship. He was also a Correspondent of the Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and a member of several other scientific associations.\n\nHis favourite studies were geology and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">meteorology</a>. The situation of his native country had naturally led him to contemplate the peculiarities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>'s structure, and the properties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, as particularly displayed in mountainous countries, and as subservient to the measurement of heights. He inherited from his father a sincere veneration for the doctrines of Christianity, and a disposition to defend the Mosaic account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, against the incredulity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His royal patroness was most anxious to encourage and promote his labours in this field; and he is universally allowed to have had great success in removing the specious objections which had been advanced by his antagonists, against the comparatively recent formation of the present continents. The testimony of Cuvier is sufficient to establish his character in this capacity, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> him, at the same time, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> geologists. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> experiments, relating to meteorology, are, however, not less valuable to the natural philosopher; and he discovered many facts of considerable importance relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and moisture. He noticed the disappearance of heat in the thawing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, about the same time that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> founded on it his ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of latent heat: he ascertained that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> was more dense about 40\u00b0 of Fahrenheit than at the temperature of freezing, expanding equally on each side of the maximum: and he was the original author of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> lately readvanced by Mr Dalton, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of aqueous vapour, contained in any space, is independent of the presence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> density of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, or of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid; though it appears difficult to reconcile this opinion with some of the experiments of our author's great rival, Saussure, a philosopher who, as he very candidly allows, made, in many respects, more rapid progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-HYGROMETRY\">hygrometry</a> than himself. Deluc's comparative experiments on his own hygrometer, and on Saussure's, show only that both are imperfect; but it may be inferred from them, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> between both would in general approach much nearer to the natural scale than either taken separately. It appears also probable, that Saussure's is rather less injured by time than Deluc's, which has been found to indicate a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of mean moisture every year than the last.\n\nHe was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of warm feelings, and of gentle and obliging manners, fulfilling on all occasions the various duties of a husband, a father, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, and a friend; at the same time, that his literary and scientific merits, and his unremitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the Queen, ensured her respect and her kindness; he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> her daily for many years, and in his last illness, which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and painful, she showed him repeated marks of benevolent regard. He died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>, on the 7th of November 1817, leaving a variety of works, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> long be remembered in the scientific world.\n\n1. *Recherches sur les modifications de l'atmosph\u00e8re*, 2 v. 4.

Paris, 1809. Also in English, by Delafite, the same year. This volume is less strictly introductory to geology than the *Lettres sur la terre*. It is principally intended as a refutation of the Vulcanian system of Hutton and Playfair, who deduced the changes of the earth's structure from the operation of fire, and attributed a higher antiquity to the present state of the continents than is required in the Neptunian system, adopted by Deluc after Dolomieu.\n\n26. He sent to the Royal Society, in 1809, a long paper *On separating the chemical from the electrical effects of the pile*, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the *Electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> and aerial electroscope*; in which he advanced opinions so little in unison with the latest discoveries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, especially with those of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the Society, that the council probably thought it would be either encouraging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> or leading to controversy to admit them into the *Transactions*. He had, indeed, on other occasions, shown somewhat too much scepticism in the rejection of new facts; and had never been convinced even of Mr Cavendish's all important discovery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of water. The paper was afterwards published in Nicholson's *Journal* (XXVI.); and the dry column described in it was constructed by various experimental philosophers. It exhibited a continual vibrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which was made more sensible by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>, struck by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> at each alternation; and the vibration was more or less rapid, according to the state of the atmospheric electricity, and according to other circumstances affecting the column: but the motion ceased at last, after a continuance of several months, or perhaps years. There are also papers in Volumes XXI. XXII. XXVII. XXVIII. XXXII. XXXIII. and\nXXXV., mostly On electricity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALVANISM\">galvanism</a>, together with one on hygrology, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Bode on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>, and a fanciful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the origin of the Heat derived from compression; some of them are dated from Ashfield, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HONITON\">Honiton</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>.\n\n27. In the Philosophical Magazine, Volumes XXXV., XLII., XLIII., and XLV., there are also some papers On electricity and geology, especially on that of St Michael's Mount, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> On the sympathetic vibrations of the pendulums of two clocks, placed near each other.\n\n28.

An \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">Abridgment</a> of geology,\" published in 1817, when he was in his ninety-first year, is mentioned as one of his best works; but it seems to have been only a republication or a translation of some former treatise, perhaps the Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire.\n\n[Philosophical Magazine, Nov. 1817. Monod and Weiss, in Biographie Universelle, XXV. 8. Paris, 1820.]\n\nLUCIMETER.\u2014This name has been given to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> employed by Bouguer for measuring the intensity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> which proceeds from different bodies.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of two lamps or candles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> near to each other, the intensity of the light may be compared, by comparing the intensity of the shadows of an adjacent body. The shadow produced by interposing the body in the stronger light is darker than its shadow, formed by the interposition of the body in the rays of the weaker; because the first shadow is enlightened only by the light it receives from the weaker light, whilst the other shadow is more strongly enlightened by the light from the stronger light. But this method will not serve for comparing the intensity of the light of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, for the light of the sun so greatly exceeds the other, that when both sun and moon are visible at the same time, the light of the moon is far too weak for any shadow to be formed by intercepting it.\n\nFor the purpose of measuring and comparing the intensity of the light of the sun and moon, Bouguer reduced the light of the sun and of the moon till the light appeared to be equal to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. The eye is able to judge whether or not two lights are equal; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the lights are unequal, it is impossible to estimate by inspection how much the one exceeds the other. Being able to calculate how much he had reduced the light of the sun and of the moon, he was enabled to say what proportion their light bore to that of the candle.\n\nFor the former, Bouguer, when the sun was at an elevation of 31 degrees above the horizon, received the light into a dark room, through a hole of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch in diameter. In this hole was placed a concave glass to weaken the light, by making the rays diverge more than they would in passing through the hole without a concave glass. He received the image formed by the divergent rays at a distance of five or six feet, by interposing a skreen, which formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the cone of divergent rays: this Lucimeter right section was a round image of the sun, of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch in diameter; therefore the light was diminished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> \\( 11,664 \\), since the light received through a hole of one line in diameter was diffused over a circle of 108 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> in diameter, and of 116 times the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a>. This light he found equal to that of a candle placed at a distance of 16 feet.\n\nHe employed the same concave glass to receive the light of the full moon; the moon being nearly at its mean distance from the earth, and at 31 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>; the same altitude as the sun had in his observation of that luminary. The light of the moon being weak, he received the image at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch from the concave glass, and then the light of the image was so weak as to be equal to the light of a candle at the distance of 50 feet.\n\nNow the light of the moon was diminished in the proportion of the square of one to sixty-four, which is the square of the diameter of its circular image. If the light of the moon had been diminished \\( 11,664 \\) times, it would have been equal to the light of the candle removed to a distance of 675 feet; for as 8, the diameter of the image, is to 50, the distance, so is 108 the diameter of the image when the light is reduced \\( 11,664 \\) times, to 675 feet, the distance of the candle, which would produce that degree of light. Therefore the light of the sun being equal to that of a candle placed at the distance of 16 inches, and the light of the moon being equal to the light of the same candle placed at the distance of 675 feet, that is, 8100 inches, it follows that the light of the sun is to the light of the moon as 65,610,000, the square of 8100, is to 256, the square of 16. This experiment gave the light of the sun 256,289 times greater than the light of the full moon. Bouguer had results somewhat different from other experiments, and taking a mean of these results, he concludes that the light of the sun is 300,000 times greater than the light of the full moon. The light of the moon, when collected into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> by a concave mirror, which condenses the light into a space 906 times less than the natural state of the light, produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sensible heat.\n\nBouguer found, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> similar to that above described, that the light of the full moon, when elevated \\( 66^\\circ 11' \\), was to the light of the full moon elevated \\( 19^\\circ 16' \\) above the horizon, as 2500 the square of 50, to 1681 the square of 41. The sun at the harbour of Croisic in Brittany, where Bouguer made his experiments, has the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> altitudes of \\( 66^\\circ 11' \\) and \\( 19^\\circ 16' \\) at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter solstices; and he concludes that the intensity of the light of the sun at the summer solstice is to the intensity of its light at the winter solstice, in the above mentioned ratio of 2500 to 1681, or about three to two. He found that the light of the moon when near the horizon, and about to set, was 2000 times less than the light of the moon elevated \\( 66^\\circ 11' \\). This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the light of heavenly bodies, when at different altitudes, proceeds from the want of transparency in the air; for when the heavenly body is not much elevated above the horizon, the rays proceeding from it have a greater distance of atmosphere to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through.\nthan the rays from the same body at a greater altitude; and the rays from a heavenly body in the zenith proceed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a diameter, and therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the atmosphere by the shortest path. Bouguer calculates that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of air passed through by the rays from a heavenly body at $66^\\circ 11'$, is equal to a supposed mass of air of the uniform density of the air at the surface of the earth, 4275 toises in thickness; and that the mass of air passed through by the rays from a heavenly body $19^\\circ 16'$ in altitude, is equal to a supposed mass of air of the density of the air at the surface, and of 11,744 toises in thickness.\n\nHe concludes that light is diminished $\\frac{3}{8}$, or about $\\frac{1}{4}$, by passing through a mass of air of the uniform density of the air at the surface, and 7469 toises in thickness. The rays from a heavenly body near the horizon are likewise impeded by the terrestrial vapours, which vary in density, and render the intensity of the light of a heavenly body at the horizon various at different times. The same cause renders the quantity of the refraction of the heavenly bodies at the horizon uncertain.\n\nIn certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the air, the discs of the sun and moon, when at the horizon, appear somewhat elliptic; the apparent vertical diameter being less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>. This is occasioned by the greater refraction of the air through which the under limb is seen; which refraction elevates the apparent place of the under limb, by a quantity sensibly greater than that quantity of refraction by which the upper limb is raised. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the rising and setting sun and moon, indicate the greater or less quantity of vapour diffused in the air, and are usefully referred to by the seaman and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> as prognostic indications of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>.\n\nThe existence of a greater or less quantity of vapour mixed with the air is also indicated by the different degrees of intensity of the blue colour of the sky. Some are of opinion, that this colour depends on the colour of the mass of air which forms the atmosphere; others maintain, that it arises from the darkness of space seen through the interposed atmosphere. The blue colour of the sky increases in intensity from the horizon to the zenith, and is particularly intense when seen from the elevated parts of the Alps, because in that situation there are few terrestrial vapours mixed with the air, and it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> colour of these vapours which renders the blue less intense in lower situations. For the purpose of estimating and noting its intensity, it is compared with different tints of blue painted on a card, as described under the article Cyanometer.\n\nSee Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumiere, par Bouguer; and Voyage de Humboldt\u2014Relation historique, Chap.

At seventeen he was admitted, after a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, as a pupil of the School of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">Military</a> Engineers; and about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he amused himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a regular tragedy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Cato. He soon distinguished himself in his military studies, and he was about to obtain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> as an officer, when an order of the minister Bouchotte imputed to him the offence of being a suspected person, probably on account of the situation held by his father, and he was dismissed from the school. He was then obliged to enter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> as a private soldier in the 5th battalion of Paris, and he was employed in this capacity on the fortifications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNKIRK\">Dunkirk</a>. Here he was soon distinguished by Mr Lepere, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the works, as superior to his accidental situation; and he was selected as one of the young men who were to constitute the members of the Ecole Polytechnique, then to be established upon the recommendation and under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Monge, who immediately chose him, from a previous knowledge of his merit, as one of the twenty that were to be made instructors of the rest. This body constituted, at that moment, the only refuge of the sciences in France, and the enthusiasm of its members was proportionate to the advantages which they enjoyed, and to the importance of the trust committed to them. In the three years which he passed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, he was\nmuch employed, among other applications of the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, in pursuing the mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, a department of science in which he was afterwards so eminently to distinguish himself by experimental discoveries. He was then, however, obliged to abandon for a time the pursuit of scientific investigations, and he was admitted into the corps of engineers, with the seniority of his former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in the school. He served in the army of the Sambre and Meuse; he was present at the passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> in 1797, and at the affairs of \"Ukratz\" and Altenkirch. While he was in Germany, he formed an engagement with Miss Koch, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> of the University of Giessen, and he was on the point of marrying her, when he was obliged to join the Egyptian expedition. He was present in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, at the battles of Chebres, and of the Pyramids; he was at the affair of Sabish, at the siege of El Arish, and at that of Jaffa. After the surrender of that place, he was employed in the repairs of the fortifications, and in the establishment of military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>. Here he was attacked by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, and fortunately recovered from it without any medical assistance. He was then sent to fortify Damietta; he was afterwards at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELIOPOLIS\">Heliopolis</a>, at the affair of Ceraim, and at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> with the English, he embarked on board of the transport <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a>, and arrived in France the 26th October 1801. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was exhausted, and his spirits were broken, by fatigue and anxiety; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to his betrothed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> was undiminished, and he hastened to Germany to fulfil his engagement: his fidelity was rewarded, during the eleven years that he survived, by the most constant and affectionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his wife; and she died a year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> two after him, a victim to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> which had been fatal to her husband.\n\nHe had, however, enough of strength and vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> remaining, to enable him, besides the official superintendence of the works carrying on at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a> and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a>, to pursue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of his favourite sciences; and upon occasion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> question, proposed by the Institute, he undertook the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the extraordinary refraction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a> crystal, which the experiments of Dr Wollaston had lately shown to agree very accurately with the laws laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by Huygens; and besides completely confirming all Dr Wollaston's results, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> greatly to extend the Huygenian discovery of the peculiar modification of light produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of such crystals, which Newton had distinguished by the name Polarity, and which Malus now found to be produced in a variety of circumstances, independently of the action of crystallized bodies. It seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to suppose that the investigation of the laws of the internal reflection of light, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> surface of the crystals, must have led him to the discovery of the effects of oblique reflection in other circumstances; but according to Biot, there was more of accident in his actual progress; for he informs us that Malus had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through a piece of crystal at the image of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, reflected from the windows of the Luxembourg, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in the Rue d'Enfer, where he lived, and that he was much surprised to find one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> images disappear in a certain position of the crystal; although the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, at a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer observe the phenomenon, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a>.\n\nThe merit of his discovery was soon acknowledged by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> as a Member of the Institute, as well as by the adjudication of a Biennial Medal from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, on the foundation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rumford.

That government had not carried the refined principle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of labour so far, as to have resolved that all public encouragement should be limited to the precise department in which a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> had been performed; and a mark of distinction, which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> could accept without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>, was not deemed an incommensurate remuneration for a discovery in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> science. Such a refinement, which has been practically introduced in our own matchless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, might appear, to a man who had a heart, something worse than sordid; he might fancy that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, as well as a great individual, should treat its dependents, \"not according to their deserts, but after its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>:\" if, however, a person in office happened to have any thing like a heart about him, the outcry of an indiscriminating opposition would soon teach him to silence its dictates.\n\n1.

This paper is principally intended to prove that two portions of light are always polarised together in opposite directions, and that no part of the light concerned is destroyed, \"as Dr Young had been inclined to suspect:\" the author found that light transmitted obliquely through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> glasses at a proper angle, becomes at last completely polarised.

He died, 24th February 1812, universally regretted by the lovers of science in all countries, and deeply lamented by his colleagues, who said of him, as Newton did of Cotes, that if his life had been prolonged, we should at last \"have known something\" of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\n(Delambre, M.

Malwah is a very elevated region, as numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> have their sources in it, and descend in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of these are the Narbudda, Chumbul, Sopra, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">Cane</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is, however, extremely fertile, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> being in general a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mould, which produces cotton, opium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, and all the various grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, besides furnishing pasture for numerous herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, &c. Like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a> and some other provinces, it has two harvests, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> superior ending in April, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or inferior in October. The tobacco, particularly that of the district of Bilshah, is highly esteemed, and carried to all parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of its produce are sent to Gujerat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROACH\">Broach</a>, or into the eastern provinces, by the rivers which communicate with the Jumna. Bickermajeet, one of the most celebrated rajahs of Hindostan, of whom there is any authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, reigned over Malwah; he overran many of the other provinces, and compelled their princes to pay him tribute, and acknowledge him as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> paramount. Such was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, that the Hindoos have adopted his reign as one of their eras. It commenced 57 years before the birth of Christ. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> was situated about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> to the northward of Oujain, and bore the same name. This province was conquered by the Mahometans in the middle of the thirteenth century; but on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Balio, in 1286, the governor Dilavur Khan rebelled, and laid the foundation of an independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, which lasted upwards of 170 years. Their capital was Mundu, a very extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, situated in the hills, 20 miles south of Oujain. Malwah was subdued, and its capital taken by the Mogul emperor Homayon, in the year 1534, and remained annexed to the empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELHI\">Delhi</a> till after the death of Aurungzebe in 1707, when it was invaded, and by degrees taken possession of by the Mahrattas; by whom it was divided into several portions among the chiefs, according to the gradual progress of their arms, which has caused such an intermixture of their territories, that it is extremely difficult to discriminate them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> landholders, called Grassiah, still retain possession of some of the hill forts, and exact contributions from the adjoining districts; and a portion of the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the province was till lately held by the Pindaree chiefs, whose incursions into the British dominions brought on the late Mahratta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Gazetteer, or Geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>.","sp":607,"ep":607},{"h":"MARMONTEL","t":"a celebrated French writer, was born in 1723 at the picturesque village of Bort, in the Limousin, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> little removed above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of peasantry. Like many other distinguished literary men of France, he owed the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> to private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> and gratuitous public institutions. His parents destined him for trade; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> induced him to assume the clerical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, and to obtain admittance into the Academy of the Jesuits at Clermont. While there he procured a subsistence, by acting, during his leisure hours, as a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to some of the more opulent students. He then went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>, where he delivered lectures in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> with considerable reputation, and gained an academical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>. His disappointment as to another prize opened for him a correspondence with Voltaire, which finally led to his departure from Toulouse for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, where he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> acquaintance of his illustrious correspondent, who at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> extended the most friendly encouragement to all young men possessed of any talents for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>.\n\nAt the time of Marmontel's arrival in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, in 1745, the prizes proposed by the Academy opened up one of the shortest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> to literary distinction, and one eagerly pursued by those who were ambitious of celebrity. Marmontel, like many others,\nMarmontel commenced his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of letters by gaining a prize for a poem on a subject proposed by the French Academy\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. perpetuated in his successor. But in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> afforded the most ample field for the acquisition of wealth and eminence. All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> was in a manner forced into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and was often recompensed with extravagant liberality. In order to qualify himself for dramatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, he commenced an assiduous study of the best critical works on the subject, which he borrowed from Voltaire; he obtained free admission to the French theatre, which he regularly attended; and he frequented the Procope Coffee-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, which was then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of criticism, and the school for young poets to study the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the public. His first tragedies, Dionysius and Aristomenes, obtained a reception sufficiently flattering for a youthful poet; but they did not keep their ground on the stage; and his succeeding ones, Cleopatra, the Heraclides, and Numitor, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> success whatever. La Harpe, who was a great dramatic critic, condemns them all as bad, except the Heraclides, which he calls a tolerable tragedy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> rank. In fact, Marmontel does not appear to have been endowed with any talents for poetry, at least of the higher order, either in point of poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. It is also evident, from his R\u00e9flexions sur la Tragedie, published at the end of his Aristomenes, that he had formed, at least in the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, the most unfounded and paradoxical theories with regard to the rules of dramatic composition. Hence his plots have, for the most part, but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> is full of puerile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>-places; and his versification is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and constrained. The plot of Dionysius hinges on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DION\">Dion</a> against the Sicilian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, and the love of the younger Dionysius (who, in defiance of all historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, is represented as a paragon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>) for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Dion, whose character is formed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the heroines of Calprenede and Scuderi. The plots of Aristomenes and Numitor are, for the most part, of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, and are both sufficiently extravagant. In the Heraclides he has followed the well-known tragedy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a> as his guide. At his first interview with Voltaire, Marmontel had been assured by him, that by the stage he might in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> obtain glory and fortune, and that one successful piece would render him at the same moment rich and celebrated. The prediction was verified; and from the instant at which his first tragedy appeared, he, who had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to pay the person who brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to his lodgings, and who lived on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> with his baker and green-grocer, was at once plunged into all the bustling intrigue of the first literary circles, and into all the glare and dissipation of fashionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. His time was occupied with rehearsals and parties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; he was received as the favoured lover of the most celebrated actress of the age, Mademoiselle Clairon; and in another intrigue in which he engaged he became the rival of Marshal Saxe. In order to shun the resentment of so formidable a rival, he retired for some time to Passy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> seat of the rich and sumptuous financier, Poplini\u00e8re, who had married his mistress, and kept open house for all the idle and dissipated literateurs of the age. By flattering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> in some occasional verses, which he wrote while residing here, he obtained the powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of Mad. de Pompadour, who procured for him the situation of Under Secretary of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Buildings. This employment fixed his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a> for five years, which were passed wholly free from inquietude, and are often alluded to by him as the happiest period of his life. The duties of his situation occupied him two days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and the remainder of his time was employed in contributing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> to the Encyclop\u00e9die, of which his friends D'Alembert and Diderot were the Editors. These articles, which contain many ingenious theories, mixed with strange paradoxes, were afterwards printed together, in alphabetical order, under the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Elements de Litterature.*\n\nHaving been engaged about the same time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, and searching into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> for the rules and means of the art, this study led him to examine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it were true, as was then often said, that all the great strokes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> had been seized by Moli\u00e8re and the dramatic poets who followed him. In running over the canvass of society, he perceived that, in the inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of follies and extravagancies of all conditions of life, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of genius might still find sufficient employment. He had even collected some observations to propose to young poets, when his friend M. de Boissi, who at the time conducted the Mercure de France, requested him to supply some pieces in prose, to insert in that literary Journal, from which Marmontel derived a considerable pension. It occurred to him to employ, in a tale, one of the touches of ridicule in his collection; and he chose, by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>, the absurd pretension of being loved merely for one's self. This was exhibited in the first of his Moral Tales, entitled Alcibiade ou Le Moi. The story was much admired, and was by some attributed to Montesquieu, and by others to Voltaire. Its success induced him to write other tales of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>; and thus commenced the Contes Moraux, which were subsequently collected and printed by themselves. Many of these tales, on which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Marmontel principally if not solely rests, bear reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> idea with which they commenced, being for the most part intended to expose some absurdity or extravagance of character. Thus the second displays the folly of those who exert authority in order to bring a woman to reason; and he chose, for example of this, a sul-\n\n* M. de Chapsal has extracted from the Elements de Litterature every thing that related to eloquence, and placed the remarks not in alphabetical order, but in that of the subject. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which is intended to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> of French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, is entitled Principes d'Eloquence de Marmontel extraits des Elements de Litterature et mis en ordre. Paris, 1809.\nMarmontel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAN\">tan</a> and his slave, as being placed in the two extremes of power and dependence. In most of them he has reached a very happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of nature, in the manners and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; and it is only to be regretted that he has occasionally thrown a too glittering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> over conceptions of the most beautiful simplicity.\n\nAs lively pictures of French manners, both simple and fashionable, they are admitted to be unrivalled. The early part of the life of Marmontel was passed amid scenes of rural innocence, with a family which lodged in a cottage, and subsisted by the labour of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; the remainder of his days was spent in the most brilliant and refined society which Paris or the world afforded, exhibiting the most splendid union of literary talents, with all the polish of exalted rank, and the graces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> elegance. This enabled him to succeed in scenes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> which were extremely remote, and, indeed, contrasted to each other\u2014in the delineation of the innocent pleasures of the country, as well as the rivalships, whims, and levities, of gay or splendid life. *The Shepherdess of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>*, which has been the most popular of them all, and *Les deux Infortun\u00e9es*, are as distinguished for simple and touching pathos as the great proportion are for liveliness. The style is remarkable for facility, and the ease with which it inclines, in pursuing the course of events, to the ludicrous or pathetic.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of M. de Boissi, Marmontel obtained the patent and sole management of the *Mercure*, of which he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> support. On receiving this appointment, he resigned that which he held at Versailles, and fixed his residence at Paris, in apartments assigned to him in the house of Mad. Geoffrin. He appears to have conducted the Journal of which he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> with great ability and judgment. Few periodical works have appeared more diversified, more attractive, or more abundant in resources; and many who afterwards came to hold the highest rank in French literature were first introduced through it to the favour of the public. After he had conducted it, however, for two years, he became suspected of writing a satire against some powerful nobleman. He was, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, shut up for a few days in the Bastile, and on his release, was deprived of his agreeable and lucrative situation. But this misfortune did not discourage his literary exertions. Soon after he had recovered his freedom, he translated into prose the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHARSALIA\">Pharsalia</a>* of Lucan, of which he was a great admirer. He also added to it a supplement, in which he details the events of Caesar's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and concludes with his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. The French have at all times been great dealers in prose translations of the Classics. But though the shape in which Marmontel exhibited the *Pharsalia* can never convey an adequate idea of the original, his work is more agreeable to read than the turgid poetical version of Brebeuf, by which it was preceded.\n\nAbout the same time at which he completed the translation of the *Pharsalia*, he published his *Po\u00e9tique Fran\u00e7oise*, containing observations extracted from the various articles which he had furnished for the *Encyclop\u00e9die*. It is divided into two parts, the first expounding the elementary principles of poetry, and the second applying them to its different sorts.\n\nBeing about this period seized with a disorder in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, which had proved fatal to both his parents, he resolved to devote his remaining days to the composition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMANCE\">Romance</a>, or fiction of the higher order. The subject he chose was *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELISARIUS\">Belisarius</a>*, suggested to him by a print he possessed from the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of Vandyck. The fact on which his tale is founded was rather a popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> than a historical truth. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> had so universally prevailed, and the idea of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> old man reduced to beggary had been so closely associated with the name of Belisarius, that it possessed all the advantages essential for the purposes of historical romance. In other particulars, the author relied on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and Procopius chiefly was his guide. On its first appearance, in 1767, *Belisaire* attracted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> chapters, describing the journey of the old blind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> to the village where his family resided\u2014his arrival there, and the visit paid to him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, in his humble habitation, are possessed of an interest almost dramatic, and are composed in a higher tone of eloquence than any thing else which he has written. But those which follow are almost entirely destitute of incident, and are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> so many separate lectures on different branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and politics delivered by Belisarius to Justinian. In the course of these dissertations, there are evidently many references to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> incidents, and the system of French politics pursued in the middle of the seventeenth century. The last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> toleration, involved the author in a dispute with the Sorbonne, who published a censure on it, which was opposed by the arguments of Turgot, and by the epigrams and squibs of Voltaire.\n\nThough Belisarius cost its author many sleepless nights, he recovered during its composition from the disorder which had excited him to the undertaking, and he sometime after produced his *Incas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>*, dedicated to Gustavus King of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>. Irritated as he was by the recent anathemas of the Sorbonne, his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in this new romance was to show, that all the evils inflicted by the Spaniards on the Indians had their origin in that fanaticism which he was desirous to bring into still deeper detestation. In Fernando de Luquez and Vincentio Requelm\u00e9 he has given a sort of personification of fanaticism in its most hideous form, and has contrasted their characters with that of Las Casas, which is intended as a model of the exalted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and tempered zeal most becoming in a Christian. In the history on which this romance is founded, Las Casas had given a tremendous picture of the atrocities committed by the Spaniards in Peru, and of the sufferings of its offensive inhabitants. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> of Marmontel had scarcely sufficient strength to paint the determined courage, rapacity, debauchery, and remorseless cruelty of the soldiery let loose on the Indians, nor the desperate characters of the adventurers at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, who knew no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and whose sole object was plunder. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> scenes of innocence, tranquillity, and peace, he has been more\nBut he has unluckily abandoned the simplicity, which charmed so much in his *Moral Tales*, for a tone too highly rhetorical; and there is a want of unity of interest from the multiplicity of episodes. The longest is that of the Conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, related to the Inca by some refugees from that country, and who had come all the way to Quito, apparently for no other purpose than to tell their long story.\n\nIn 1763, Marmontel had been admitted, though after considerable opposition, to the much envied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of a member of the French Academy, and, in 1783, he succeeded D'Alembert as its perpetual secretary. The situation of Historiographer of France, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">Chair</a> of History in the Lyceum, which he successively obtained, fully indemnified him for the loss of the *Mercure*. He was in the full enjoyment of affluent circumstances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> felicity, and literary reputation, when the French Revolution suddenly changed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. During its alarming progress he led a retired life, and though reduced to indigent circumstances, remained secure amid all the violent events of the period. In 1797, he was chosen a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> to the National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> by the department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EURE\">Eure</a>, but died soon afterwards, of an apoplectic attack, at his cottage near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEVILLE\">Abbeville</a>.\n\nSeveral of his pieces were published after his death. The *Nouveaux Contes Moraux*, which were inserted in the *Mercure*, had been extracted from that journal, and translated into English soon after their first appearance; but they were not printed apart in their original language till after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMISE\">demise</a> of the author. This second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> is inferior in delicacy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of style, to the former; but the scope and tendency of the stories is more strictly moral. On account of his situation as Historiographer of France, Marmontel had thought it a duty incumbent on him to write some historical work. The period he chose was the Regency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, which he commenced in 1784; but though he completed it four years afterwards, it was not given to the public during his life. This work is not such, either in point of accuracy of facts, or enlightened general views, as might have been expected from the time occupied in its composition, the materials which his situation opened up to him, or the pompous account which he himself gives of his access to information: \"All the great men,\" says he, \"of the age opened to me the repositories which contained documents on my subject. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de Broglie initiated me into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of his most secret negotiations, and Contades traced to me, with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of his campaigns, and particularly of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINDEN\">Minden</a>.\" The most interesting part is the last chapter, containing the relation of some particular incidents which occurred during the regency, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, and the visit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CZAR\">Czar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> to France.\n\nThe Posthumous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of Marmontel, drawn up in his declining years for the instruction of his children, and edited in 1804, from a MS. in his own hand-writing, are among the most amusing volumes of the description ever presented to the public. They commence with the author's earliest youth: the portion which comprehends this period of his life is written in the happiest style of his *Moral Tales*, and Marmontel contains many interesting anecdotes of humble innocence, many animated sketches of domestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, and many agreeable traits of village society. In the succeeding part, the portraits of the most distinguished characters, in the most brilliant age of France, are delineated with so much life, discrimination, and delicacy, and every thing is sketched with a colouring so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and aerial, that the whole representation is exquisite. There is scarcely a single person of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> in France whose likeness is not exhibited in this vast gallery,\u2014the pictures of Voltaire, D'Alembert, Marivaux, Thomas, St Lambert, and Helvetius, are all excellent. The society which Marmontel frequented was probably the most refined and brilliant that had ever assembled together; but there was evidently a restraint, a desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>, and want of ease in its intercourse. \"Every guest,\" says Marmontel, \"arrived ready to play his part; in Marivaux, impatience to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of acuteness and sagacity was visibly betrayed; Montesquieu, with more calm, waited till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> came to him, but he expected it; Helvetius, attentive and discreet, sat collecting for a future day.\" Literary fame was enjoyed in France in its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, but also in its greatest anxiety. Of all the others, Voltaire had gained the most brilliant literary success; yet of him Marmontel remarks, that his glory was too dearly paid by the tribulations to which it had exposed him. It had been said by Mad. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENLIS\">Genlis</a>, that Marmontel, in his *Moral Tales*, showed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the French manners and character, in representing the higher classes, particularly of females, as so voluptuous, and in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> abandoned; but the *Memoirs*, if they record the truth, unhappily confirm his representations. When so much amusement is derived from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> descriptions, it is perhaps hypercritical to remark, that some petty circumstances, of no general interest, and which might have been better thrown into the back-ground, are brought too much out on the canvass, and are drawn in disproportioned magnitude. But for these details, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> as his apology, that it is for his children he writes the history of his life, and that those things which may appear too minute to strangers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> prove interesting and useful to them. The concluding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, containing a sketch of the first events of the Revolution, is confused and imperfect. Its incidents were too gigantic for the grasp of his mind, and he appears to have been dizzied and stupified by the rapid whirl and total subversion which he witnessed.\n\nAn author by profession, the literary character of Marmontel may be fully appreciated from his various and numerous productions. Though he admits that, while he has given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of others at full length in his *Memoirs*, he has only painted himself in profile; yet from them his private character may be correctly enough estimated. On a review of these, it has been remarked, \"That without great passions, or great talents, he seems to have had a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, a pliant and cheerful disposition, and a delicacy of taste and discrimination, of still greater value in the society which fixed his reputation. Although good tempered and social, he\nMarinette seems to have been, in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, without heart or affection; or rather the dissipated and sensual life to which he devoted himself after his removal to Paris, appears to have obstructed in him the growth of all generous and exalted feeling. In society he was joyous and easy; gay, without affecting to dazzle; and ingenious, without intolerance or fastidiousness.\"\n\nMaskelyne (Nevill), a most industrious and accurate astronomer, born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 6th October 1752, was the son of Edmund Maskelyne, Esq., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of respectable family of Purton in Wiltshire.\n\nHe was sent at the age of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> School, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to apply with diligence to the usual pursuits of that place, until the occurrence of the great solar eclipse of 1748, which made a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on his mind, and which was the immediate cause of his directing his attention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and of his beginning the study of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> with great ardour, as subservient to that of astronomy. It is remarkable, that the same eclipse is said to have made an astronomer of Lalande, who was only three months older than Maskelyne. He soon after entered as a member of Catherine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, but shortly removed to Trinity. He took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as Bachelor of Arts with great credit in 1754, and proceeded regularly afterwards through the succeeding stages of academical rank in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>. He was ordained in 1755 to a curacy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARNET\">Barnet</a>, and the next year obtained a fellowship at Trinity. In 1758 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, having previously become intimate with Dr Bradley, and having determined to make astronomy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> pursuit of his life, feeling its perfect compatibility with an enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> to the duties of his own profession.\n\nIn 1761 he was engaged by the Royal Society to undertake a voyage to St Helena, in order to observe the transit of Venus. He remained ten months in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> prevented his observing the transit to advantage, and the faulty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the plumb-line of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, which was of the construction then usually employed, rendered his observations on the stars less conclusive with respect to annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> than he had expected. His voyage was, however, of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, by promoting the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> observations for ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>; and he taught the officers of the ship which conveyed him the proper use of the instruments, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of making the computations.\n\nHe performed a second voyage, in 1763, to the island of Barbadoes, in order to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of Harrison's watches, and to make experiments with Irwin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> chair, on board of the Princess Louisa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Tyrell, acting at the same time as chaplain to the ship. The chair he found of very little use for observing the eclipses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites, and the maker of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHRONOMETERS\">chronometers</a> was not satisfied with his report of their performance; fancying that he was too partial to the exclusive employment of lunar observations for determining the longitude. The liberality of the British Government, however, bestowed on Harrison the whole reward that he claimed; and Maskelyne, having been appointed to the situation of Astronomer Royal, and having thus become a member of the Board of Longitude, was extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in obtaining a few thousand pounds for the family of Professor Mayer, who had computed lunar tables, and a compliment of L300 only for Euler, whose theorems had been employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>.\n\nThe merits of Mayer's tables having been fully established, the Board of Longitude was induced to promote their application to practical purposes, by the annual publication of the Nautical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a>, which was arranged and conducted entirely under Maskelyne's direction for the remainder of his life. He was also actively employed, without any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> than the love of science and of his country, in almost every decision which was required of the Board of Longitude; and he had to give his opinion of the merits of an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of fruitless projects which were continually submitted to his judgment. He must of course have made many enemies among the weak and illiberal; but the universal impartiality, and the general accuracy of his determinations, were acknowledged by all candid persons; and it must be admitted that the longitudinal speculators of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> do in general submit to discouraging remarks from persons in authority with wonderful fortitude, and with great personal civility.\n\nDuring the forty-seven years that he held the situation of Astronomer Royal, he acquired the respect of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by the diligence and accuracy of his observations, which he never neglected to conduct in person whenever it was in his power, and he required only one assistant. The French had a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> to amuse the public by its exterior magnificence, but the establishment of the observers was never arranged in so methodical a manner as that of the English National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of their labours were never systematically made public; the attempt which was once made by Lemonnier, in his Histoire C\u00e9leste, having been interrupted and discontinued. Dr Maskelyne, on the other hand, obtained leave from the British Government to have his observations printed at the public expense, under the direction of the Royal Society, who are the legal visitors of the Observatory, appointed by the King's sign manual. The early observations of Flamsteed and Bradley were considered as private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>; Flamsteed published his own, and Bradley's were very liberally bought of his family, and afterwards printed by the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, who are still as liberal in bestowing them where they are likely to be employed for the benefit of science. Flamsteed was the Astronomer Royal from 1690 to 1720; then Halley to 1750; Bradley to 1762, and Bliss to 1765, when Maskelyne was appointed. He took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s degree in 1777.\n\nHe made several improvements in the arrangement and employment of the instruments, particularly by enlarging the slits through which the light was admitted; by making the eye-glass of his transit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a> moveable to the place of each of the wires of the micrometer; and above all, by marking the time to tenths of a second, which had never been attempted before; but which he found it practicable to effect with surprising accuracy, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the\nMaskelyne observations at the different wires sufficiently demonstrated.\n\nThe object of his expedition to Sheallien is well known. Bouguer had made an unsuccessful attempt to measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of a mountain in South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, and had been obliged to conclude that the mountain was hollow, in consequence of the eruption of a volcano, the attraction being too little sensible. Dr Maskelyne's results, on the other hand, as computed by Dr Hutton, made the mountain more dense than could well have been expected; but those who are acquainted with the difficulty of executing astronomical measurements without an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of a single second of space, will be ready to allow that the deviation of 5\" or 6\", attributed to the effect of the mountain, is liable to a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> uncertainty than the results obtained by Mr Cavendish with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> invented by Mr Michell. (See Cavendish.) The geodetical operations which were soon afterwards performed with his concurrence and assistance, for determining the relative situations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> and Paris, were equally creditable to the English artists who constructed the instruments, and to the astronomers and geographers who made the observations with them; and they excelled, even by the confession of their rivals, every thing that had ever been effected in former measurements of the same kind.\n\nAs no man had done more for practical astronomy than Dr Maskelyne, so there was none whose merits were more justly appreciated. He made every astronomer his friend, as well by his personal kindness, as by his professional labours; and he obtained the rare distinction of being made one of the eight foreign associates of the Parisian Academy of Sciences. His example and encouragement contributed to the establishment of several private observatories, which must always be, if not immediately, at least remotely, beneficial to astronomy, as tending to promote the improvement of instruments, and of the methods of employing them.\n\nHe was modest, and somewhat timid, in receiving the visits of strangers; but his usual conversation was cheerful, and often playful, with a fondness for point, and for classical allusion. He inherited a good paternal property, and he obtained considerable preferment from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>; he also married, somewhat late in life, the sister and co-heiress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Booth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a>. His sister was the wife of Robert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Clive, and the mother of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Powis. He died the 9th of February 1811, in his 79th year, leaving a widow and an only daughter.\n\n1. Dr Maskelyne's first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> to the Royal Society is A proposal for discovering the annual parallax of Sirius. Phil. Trans. L.I. 1760. p. 889. It is founded on Lacaille's observations, made at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, which appeared to indicate a maximum amounting to 8\". 2. A theorem for spherical aberration. L.II. 1761. p. 17. Dated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Henry, St Helen's Roads: the calculation is adapted to the object-glasses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> telescopes. 3. The next article, p. 21, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from Lacaille, recommending him to make observations at St Helena on the lunar parallax, and to remain some time in the island for that purpose; promising, on his own part, to make corresponding observations. It is followed by a Letter from Maskelyne, proposing some additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> observations. 4. Observation of the transit of 1761, p. 196. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> was lower than had been expected, and the instant of contact uncertain, from a tremulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> discs. 5. Observations on a clock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHELTON\">Shelton</a>, 1762, p. 434. Giving the proportion of .99754 to 1 for the comparative force of gravity at Greenwich and at St Helena. 6. A letter on the mode of observing and computing lunar distances, p. 558. Dated from St Helena: the first demonstration of the practicability and utility of the method. He found the error of observation not to exceed half a degree of longitude, an error which was very strangely suffered to remain as a fair allowance for the uncertainty of observation, in the acts for encouraging the perfection of the lunar tables, only very lately repealed. 7.

Correcting a mistake of Lacaille, and an inadvertence of Lalande, and giving a formula, which, though not geometrically perfect, is abundantly accurate for all practical purposes. 11. Astronomical observations made at St Helena, p. 348. The observations for determining the lunar parallax were too few to afford a satisfactory result. The author suggests, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> might be ascertained by repeated and comparative observations of the apparent distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> from neighbouring stars. 12. Observations made at Barbadoes, p. 189. Especially on Jupiter's satellites. 13. Introduction to two papers of Mr Swedon. LVIII. 1768, p. 154. The one on the menstrual parallax, the other on observing stars out of the meridian. 14. Introduction to the observations of Mason and Dixon, p. 270. 15. Conclusion respecting the length of a degree, p. 323, 325. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Mason had been sent with Mr Dixon to observe the transit of 1761, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENCOOLEN\">Bencoolen</a>, but their voyage was interrupted by accidental circumstances, and they made their observations at the Cape of Good Hope, with tolerable success. They then proceeded to join Maskelyne at St Helena, and to assist in his operations there. They were afterwards engaged by Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALTIMORE\">Baltimore</a> and Mr Penn, to determine the boundaries between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARYLAND\">Maryland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>; and having completed their survey, they suggested to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of the Royal Society the eligibility of measuring a degree in the country bordering on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DELAWARE\">Delaware</a> and Chesapeake. Their proposals were readily accepted, and the results of their measurement are here recorded. Dr Maskelyne afterwards employed Mason, in his operations on Sheallien, and in computing Bradley's observations, and in improving Mayer's tables, by a comparison with them; but he was so fearful of admitting any empirical corrections, not founded on the most general principles, that he would not allow some of the equations, discovered by Mason, to be intro-\nMaskelyne introduced into the computation of the *Nautical Almanac*, until Laplace had proved their dependence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of gravity. Lalande tells us, that Mason was dissatisfied because he did not receive a public reward for the success of his labours; but he was, in fact, little more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> of Maskelyne, and of the Board of Longitude; and he was fairly repaid for the time and labour which his computations had required. Delambre says, that he died in Pennsylvania in 1787. Dixon is said to have been born in a coal mine; and to have died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a> in 1777.\n\n15. Postscript respecting French and English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, p. 325. The result of this comparison agrees admirably well with the later measurement of Pictet, Prony, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Kater.\n\n16.

Mason had been sent to examine the hills of Scotland, and had recommended Sheallien; the funds were supplied by the remainder of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> for observing the transit of Venus. Mr Reuben Burrow and Mr Menzies were principally employed in assisting the Astronomer Royal in his observations and surveys; and Dr Hutton afterwards made the necessary computations for determining the attraction of the mountain.\n\n24.

With Cassini's memoir on its uncertainty, which he states as amounting to 11\u00b0 in longitude, and 15\u00b0 in latitude. Dr Maskelyne, however, shows that it is confined within much narrower limits, though he approves of the object of the memoir in promoting a survey.\n\n28. On a difficulty in the theory of vision, 1789, p. 256. This paper sufficiently proves, that Euler was mistaken in thinking the eye achromatic; and that any appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> which it could produce, according to the common laws of refraction, would be imperceptible in ordinary circumstances. But that there are circumstances, under which such appearances may be observed, has been more lately shown by Dr Young and Dr Wollaston.\n\n29.

The earliest of Maskelyne's separate publications was his *British mariner's guide*, 4. Lond. 1763. A small volume, which has become scarce, having been superseded by later works.\n\n32. The nautical almanac and astronomical ephemeris for 1767 appeared in 1766; and the publication has been regularly continued upon the same plan to the present time, by the computers and comparers whom Dr Maskelyne had trained by his instruction and example. His successor in the Observatory, though admirably qualified to equal, and perhaps to excel him in the practical department, had it not in his power to devote so much of his attention to the publication, as Dr Maskelyne's paternal affection for a child of his own had induced him to bestow on it; and the Board of Longitude was very liberally furnished by the present ministry, with the means of obtaining some further assistance to supply his place.\n\n33. Tables requisite to be used with the nautical almanac, 8. Lond. 1766, 1783, 1802. Now partly superseded by Professor Lax's new edition.\n\n34. The volume of *Selections*, from the additions that have been occasionally made to the *Nautical almanac*, 8. Lond. 1812, contains several papers of Dr Maskelyne. For example, *Instructions relating to the transit of Venus in 1769*, N. A. 1769. *Elements of lunar tables*, and *Remarks on Hadley's quadrant*, N. A. 1774. *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">Advertisement</a> of the comet expected in 1788*, N. A. 1791. *On the disappearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> in 1780*, N. A. 1791.\n\n35. The Astronomical observations made at Greenwich, from 1765 to 1811, were published annually in folio; making three volumes, and part of a fourth, Lond. 1774... They are allowed to constitute the most perfect body of astronomy in detail that was ever presented to the public. The first volume contains a variety of useful tables, accompanying the observations for 1772; and principally serving for the correction of the places of the stars, and for facilitating the solution of other astronomical problems. Many of them have been reprinted in Vince's *Astronomy*; but, in some cases, without the necessary explanations.\n\n[(Kelly in) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REES\">Rees</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CYCLOPAEDIA\">Cyclopaedia</a>.

He was afterwards obliged to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of two young men at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENS\">Sens</a>, as their private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>; and he accidentally became acquainted with Lalande on occasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> which he had procured, and of which Lalande became the purchaser; and it was under Lalande's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> that he was brought forward as an observer, surveyor, and computer. He made two voyages with Mr de la Bretonniere, and assisted him in surveying some parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of France. He was afterwards employed in various computations by the Marquis de Chabert and the Duc d'Ayen.\n\nHaving obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> from the Academy of Sciences in 1782, for a Memoir on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>, he became a member of the Academy the same year. Having proved that the hopes entertained by some astronomers of recovering an old comet were unfounded, he made up in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> for the disappointment, by finding them eleven new ones in the course of eighteen years; and he computed the orbits not only of all these, but of thirteen others, which had been discovered by other observers: emulating in this department the labours of both his predecessors, Messier and Pingr\u00e9.\n\nAbout 1785, he undertook the publication of the Connaissance des Temps, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> it till he was employed in geodetical operations at a distance from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. He was appointed, together with Cassini, de Thury, and Legendre, to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> to meet the English astronomers for the determination of the relative situation of the observatories, which had been proposed by Cassini. It was in these operations that he first brought Borda's circle into general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. He was soon after, in 1789, made a Foreign Member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\nIn 1791, he was appointed, in conjunction with Delambre, to execute the intentions of the Constituent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a>, with regard to the determination of a basis of linear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. A variety of delays and difficulties occurred in these operations; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> he was wounded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and in the side, by an ac-\nincident which occurred while he was inspecting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-wheel; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> circumstances of the times produced many embarrassments, which caused him to linger in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> perhaps a little longer than was actually necessary; but the establishment of the Bureau des Longitudes, and his nomination as a member of it, determined his immediate return to Paris. He was now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a>, and he entered with great zeal on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of observations, which were to rival those of Flamsteed, of Bradley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of Maskelyne; but he seems to have been a little tired of the confinement, and he readily accepted, or rather solicited, the appointment to take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> in the measurements required for the still further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the arc of the meridian to the south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>. But the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for his seeking this humbler employment appears to have been a desire to remove some doubts which he entertained respecting the latitude of Barcelona, as it appeared after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> from his papers, that there had been a discordance of 3\u00b0 in some observations which he had not made public. In this unfortunate undertaking, he paid a heavy penalty for any want of candour which may have been attributed to the concealment; shipwreck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> awaited him; and he died at last, at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, the 20th September 1805, of a fever, which fatigue and a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> had brought on. The severe stage of his illness was so short, that his son, who accompanied and assisted him in the survey, had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to join him.\n\nFrom the time of his accident in Spain he had become habitually melancholy and timid, though regardless of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> danger in the pursuit of his professional objects. His whole time was occupied in observing and calculating: he published little; and never hazarded to advance any reflections on the subjects which employed him, being probably more in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of acting than of speculating. He married, in 1777, Miss Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Marjon, with whom he had become acquainted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>. This connexion was in every respect happy; he was indebted to it for a competent fortune, and he left a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> and two sons.\n\n1. Of his publications we find the most important in the M\u00e9moires des Savans \u00e9trangers; that is, besides some Observations of eclipses and occultations, a Memoir on the comets of 1552 and 1661; showing that they are not the same; and their non-appearance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight years afterwards fully justified his conclusions, and the adjudication of the prize.\n\n2. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy, from 1782 to 1784, there are several of his Observations of transits, eclipses, occultations, and comets.\n\n3. There are also some letters of M\u00e9chain in Zach's Geographical ephemerides about 1800, on the instruments of the Parisian Observatory, and on other subjects.\n\n4.

He came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> at 20, and had then to seek his fortune, having only learned to write a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and to draw. Delisle employed him as a copyist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>. Libour, his secretary, taught him to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> instruments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, to observe eclipses, and to look out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>; and this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> business of his subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; for he was never much of a theoretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> philosophical astronomer. Delisle obtained for him an appointment as clerk in the Hydrographical Department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a>, and gave him his board and lodging in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and he claimed in return the singular gratification of keeping all Messier's observations of comets secret for his own private amusement, until their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> was completely lost.\n\nMessier had already discovered 12 comets when he lost his wife; his attendance on her sick-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> prevented his discovering a 13th: and it is said that the circumstance added not a little to his grief for her loss. He afterwards became Astronomer to the Navy, instead of being only a clerk in the department. He obtained a seat in the Academy with some difficulty, and not till 1770; being considered as too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> an observer to have a very strong claim to that distinction. He was fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a> of the paths of comets, and of other astronomical phenomena; one of these procured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being made an Academician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, and another, with Laharpe's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, obtained him the same distinction from Petersburgh. He was also made a Fellow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in 1764. The highest compliment that he ever received was paid him, perhaps without sufficient reason, by Lalande, who inserted, in his celestial globe of 1775, a constellation with the name of Messier, or Messium custos, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">Harvest</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a>; in the neighbourhood of Cepheus. When Herschel had discovered the Georgian planet, he was very diligently engaged in observing its motions; but, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, his studies were interrupted by an unfortunate accident: he fell into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICE_HOUSE\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>-house, in a garden, which he mistook for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a grotto, and fractured an arm and a thigh. He was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in recovering, and he obtained a small pension on the occasion, from the royal bounty, by the solicitations of Mr Sage and some others of his friends, who had interest. He was, however, soon deprived of it by the Revolution; but he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his pursuits as a private individual, and he amused the last days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> de Saron by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to him his observations, which Saron continued to compute during the imprisonment that was terminated by his barbarous execution. Messier was in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> compensated for his pecuniary losses by being made a Member of the Institute, of the Bureau des Longitudes, and of the Legion of Honour. He lived, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> or material infirmity, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 82, when his sight began to fail him, and he required a deep glass, which he found it fatiguing to use. He had afterwards a paralytic attack; but he lived to be near 87; and died of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, or probably rather of old age, the 11th of April 1817.\n\n1. A variety of his observations, especially of Comets, are published in the M\u00e9moires des Savans \u00e9trangers, V.-VI.\n\n2. After his admission into the Academy, he was a constant contributor to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> from 1771 to 1790. His papers consist almost entirely of Observations of comets and eclipses, with some Accounts of Aurorae Boreales. There is also a Catalogue of Nebulae in 1771; An Account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> seen on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> in 1774; and of An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of globules over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISC\">disc</a>, 1777.\n\n3. In the Connaissance des tems, there is a collection of his Observations of the eclipses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites. He had an excellent sight, and excellent telescopes; and he made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the eclipses almost always shorter than other astronomers.\n\n4. He contributed some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> to the Astronomical Ephemerides of Professor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELL\">Hell</a>, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>.\n\n5. The Voyage de Courtenaux sur la fregatte l'Aurore, 4. Paris, 1768, was written by Pingr\u00e9:\nthe observations are Messier's: the purpose of the voyage was to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of several astronomical instruments.\n\n6. His only separate publication was entitled *Grande com\u00e8te qui a paru \u00e0 la naissance de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NAPOLEON\">Napoleon</a> le <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a>*, 4.

It was probably not calculated for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was a genuine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Messier.\n\n7. Delambre is in possession of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his unpublished observations of the solar spots; but he found their results, when computed, somewhat unsatisfactory.\n\n[Delambre in *Biographie Universelle*, XXVIII. 8. Paris, 1821. See also *\u00c9loge de Delisle*, by La-lande, in *N\u00e9crologie des hommes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres de France*. 12. Paris, 1770.]\n\n(x. a.)\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">METEOROLOGY</a>,**\n\n*From atmosph\u00e8re, sublimis,* is that science which describes and explains the various phenomena which occur in the region of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. It has deeply engaged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of men in every state of society, from the roving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> to the refined votary of wealth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The moment we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> our doors, we commit ourselves to the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. But the hardier classes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, the shepherd, the ploughman, and the mariner, whose labour creates or procures the staple articles of life, are always exposed, by their occupation, to the mercy of the elements. They were hence led, by the strongest motives, to examine closely the varying appearance of the sky, and to distinguish certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> alterations which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> precede the more important changes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> doubt they would often mistake the indications of those aspects, and would infer conclusions from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> casual circumstances. Those tokens which portend the more violent convulsions of the atmosphere\u2014the pelting storm, or the careering tempest\u2014are generally of a decided character; but the symptoms which go before the ordinary fluctuations of the weather can only be dimly conjectured by long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and sagacious observation. This shadowy knowledge, this dubious and very limited anticipation of the changes which arrive in the medium we breathe, is merely the fruit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> assiduity and application. Like the conclusions which men of discernment form to themselves on the subject of physiognomy, it is scarcely communicable; it receives, therefore, no accessions in the progress of ages, but perishes with the individual.\n\nThe vague rules which experience had formed on the subject of atmospheric changes were adopted by the philosophers of antiquity, and incorporated into their cosmological systems. But in attempting to explain the phenomena, they sought merely to satisfy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; and the supposition of certain elements, each endowed with peculiar properties, appeared, on a superficial view, to connect harmoniously the general facts.\n\nIn the infancy of science, however, it was very difficult to distinguish between such appearances as are only incidental, and those constant presages which invariably anticipate their effects. The different fluctuations that happen in the lower atmosphere seemed dependant on the influence of the heavenly bodies, which are continually altering their places. Not only the sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> appeared to rule the seasons, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, and even the fixed stars, were conceived to retard or accelerate, by their feebler <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, the revolution of the grand cycle of changes. The application of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> aspect to the positions of those remote bodies implied a principle of intelligence, and the stellar influence shed by them might, therefore, be deemed capable of producing all the variety of effects. Hence the origin of *Physical Astrology*, which has, during so many ages, maintained ascendancy in the world, and still colours the verses of our poets, and pervades the creed of the vulgar.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> evolved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> particles transmitted from the sun, as they lose themselves among the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of our atmosphere, or under the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, varying in its intensity, according to the obliquity of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of medium which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a>, produces the most important effects in the great economy of the globe. But the correct knowledge we have at length acquired concerning the mutual action of bodies, contracts the limits of the supposed celestial influence almost to a point. The light of the moon does not amount to the 100,000th part of that of the sun, and the heat which this very feeble illumination excites or communicates, has never been detected by the most delicate instruments, or the best devised experiments. But all the rays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> from the planets, and from the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTELLATIONS\">constellations</a> of fixed stars, are quite lost in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> with those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> beams. Their combined impressions, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of countless ages on the atmospheric temperature, would hence elude the utmost powers of calculation.\n\nIt is only by their attractive force that the heavenly bodies, except the warming energy of the sun, can ever affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of this globe. As by their action unequally exerted over its surface, they raise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> in the ocean, so they must likewise agitate the atmosphere with a corresponding reciprocation. This effect, however, depends much more on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of the disturbing body, than on its magnitude or density. Thus the sun, with twenty-three million times the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the moon, yet being about four hundred times more distant, has only about the third part of her influence in causing the tides. But, according to the computations of Laplace, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> action of the sun and moon is only capable of producing a tropical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, flowing westward at the rate of about four miles a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> too small evidently to be ever subjected to observation, and certainly insufficient to occasion any immediate and practical results.\n\nIt may be calculated, that Jupiter and Venus, in\nthose parts of their orbits which approach the nearest to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, affect the aerial tides by a force 76,000 and 82,000 times less than the sun. Those planets could, therefore, excite a most minute shifting in the atmosphere, limited to a foot in the space of 14 or 15 days or about a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in 20 years. As the mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> is unknown, its disturbing force cannot be estimated, though it is less than that of Jupiter. But the combined influence of all the rest of the solar system is, from their great distance, incomparably smaller.\n\nNothing can be so utterly groundless, therefore, as the disposition to refer the ordinary changes of the weather to the influence of the moon. But, compared with this, the fancied efficacy of the stellar aspects, which was for ages firmly believed by the learned world, vanishes into the shadow of a vision. Nor has the most elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of numerous registers of the weather disclosed any precise and constant connection between the phases of the moon or the positions of the stars, and the succession of atmospherical phenomena. The inferences which seem to indicate a different conclusion, may be fairly disregarded, as drawn only from a loose and imperfect inspection of facts.\n\nIt cannot be disputed, however, that all the changes which happen in the mass of our atmosphere,\u2014involved, capricious, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> as they may appear,\u2014are yet the necessary results of principles as fixed, and perhaps as simple, as those which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the revolutions of the solar system. Could we unravel the intricate maze, we might trace the action of each distinct cause, and hence deduce the ultimate effects arising from their combined operation. With the possession of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a>, we might safely predict the state of the weather at any future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, as we now calculate an eclipse of the sun or moon, or foretell a conjunction of the planets. After the protracted chain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> has been completed, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of events must again be repeated through the boundless lapse of ages. As all the anomalies of the planets are periodical, so likewise the successive varieties follow some cycle of vast extent. In the remotest annals of atmospherical phenomena, we might descry a gleam of futurity, and read the changes which still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> hid in the womb of time.\n\nBut, besides this great cycle, there probably are much shorter interior and subordinate periods, in which the weather nearly, though not absolutely, returns after the same order. Whatever principles concur to modify its succession, the revolutions of the sun and moon are certainly the primary and predominant causes. The character of the weather is accordingly strongly marked by the vicissitudes of day and night, and by the annual repetition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter. The menstrual action of the moon escapes correct observation; but, accumulated during a sufficient time, it may possibly produce a decided influence. Every 19 years the motions of the moon come to coincide with those of the sun, and her nodes perform their revolutions in nearly the same time, or about 18 years. This period, or the half of it, has therefore not improbably some slight connexion with the usual series of the changes of the weather.\n\n\"If the sages of antiquity be justly blamed for adopting implicitly the notions and prejudices of the vulgar, those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with too eager a disposition to reject whatever savours of popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. A collection of the numerous rules and remarks formed in the course of ages among different orders of men, deeply interested by their occupations in watching the changes of the sky, would undoubtedly contain some important truths, which the diligence and sagacity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> might discriminate, and employ for the basis of beneficial speculations. The most sanguine can hardly uphold the prospect that mankind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ever arrive at such a pitch of knowledge, as to be capable of prognosticating the future modifications of the atmosphere, with the same precision with which they can foretel the successive revolutions of the heavenly bodies; yet the motions, however irregular in appearance, which prevail in the element that we breathe, are, equally with those performed in the regions of space, the result of certain fixed laws. The variable aspect of the sky proceeds partly from the direct action of the sun-beams, but principally from the winds which they excite and maintain. The unequal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a> of the different portions of our atmosphere to the sun, and to the moon especially, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> occasion some small effect in producing or altering the aerial currents; and even the disturbing forces of the planets have a remote share, how minute soever, in the formation of meteors. Nor can we hesitate to conclude, with the late ingenious and eloquent M. Bailly, whose fate demands the tribute of a tear, that the notions, so widely spread among men, of the aspects and influences of the celestial bodies, are only the corrupted remains of astronomical science, already advanced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> perfection in some distant age of the world. If motions were to rise and cease instantaneously with the operation of their causes, the same succession of seasons would exactly attend on each revolution of the sun; but the currents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> acquire velocity by degrees, and thenceforth continue to flow till their force is spent. The varied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of our terraqueous globe will, therefore, modify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, the power, and the duration of the winds, raised by the action of the solar rays. Hence an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> complication of causes, which will produce an immense series of fluctuating events. That profound geometer, M. de la Grange, has established by demonstration that all the changes arising from the disturbing forces in the planetary system are subjected to certain vast cycles, on the return of which the same motions are perpetually renewed. Similar periods, but of an extent that affrights the imagination, probably regulate the modifications of the atmosphere; for, whenever a coincidence of circumstances prevails, the series of appearances must inevitably recur. The aggregate labours, indeed, of men continually transform the face of our globe, and consequently alter the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> causes\u2014but, if the agency of animals be stimulated and determined solely by the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects, it follows that the re-actions of living beings are comprehended in the same necessary system, and that all the events within the immeasurable circuit of the universe are the successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> of an ex-\ntended series, which, at the returns of some vast period, repeats its eternal round during the endless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> of time. Besides the grand cycle, there must evidently be many intermediate smaller periods, at the lapse of which our atmosphere will present nearly, though not exactly, the same fleeting aspects. Whether these bear any decided relation to the lunar revolutions, cannot with certainty be affirmed. A copious collection of registers formed in the course of ages will probably, at some future time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the discovery of certain remarkable periods, which will enable men to conjecture, with tolerable precision, the succeeding changes of the weather. It would be most advisable, perhaps, to begin the inquiry with the tropical countries, in which the seasons are more uniform, and to advance by degrees into the temperate climates. In the mean time, our prognostications may be greatly assisted by observing and studying the concatenation of phenomena. Certain coincidences of aspects mark the near recurrence of some small portions of the general series, and afford scope for the doctrine of chances.\" (Monthly Review for September 1795, Art. I, p. 14.)\n\nSuch views of the cyclical returns of the varied seasons may expand the imagination, but will be considered rather as curious speculations, than as definite conclusions which can ever be reduced to real and actual application. To improve meteorology we must submit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> a humbler path; we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> closely, and by the aid of delicate instruments, the constitution and modifications of the atmosphere, and pursue, under various circumstances, and in different parts of the globe, a lengthened train of careful and precise observations. The ordinary registers of the weather are of a very modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, and besides being for the most part unskilfully kept, they seldom record more than the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> and thermometer, which afford not any complete indication of the disposition of the atmosphere. No wonder that meteorology, though cultivated from the earliest times, has advanced the most slowly to the perfection of science.\n\nTo prepare the way for establishing meteorology on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> basis, we shall first inquire into the extent and constitution of the medium which we breathe; and shall next review the different philosophical instruments which assist external observation, and indicate at all times the exact condition and qualities of that mutable fluid.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> imagined that our atmosphere, the seat of care, mortality, and corruption, reached as far as the moon, beyond which was a boundless expanse of resplendent aether, the abode of celestial beings, exempt by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> from all anxiety, and absorbed in the enjoyment of eternal bliss. But the discovery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and pressure of the air destroyed at once this magnificent vision. Comparing the length of the mercurial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> with the density of the aerial medium, it followed, that if the atmosphere had been an uniform fluid it could not exceed the elevation of five miles. But the air being very dilateable, the higher portions of the mass which covers our globe, sustaining a diminished pressure, must swell upwards, and occupy a proportionally wider space. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> hence removes the boundary of the atmosphere to a much greater elevation.\n\nBy means of an excellent pneumatic machine, air can be rarified about a thousand times; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> would not occur below the height of forty-two miles in the atmosphere. Such is nearly the limit deduced from another consideration, first proposed by the famous Kepler. This most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and inventive philosopher conceived, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of the sun below the horizon, when twilight closes around us, might furnish the data for discovering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of the portion of sky which reflects his latest parting rays. Let C (see fig. 2, Plate XCVII.) be the position of a spectator on the surface of the earth, and A represent the point where the sun sets, the tangent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> will mark the track of his lowest ray, which illuminates the upper part of the atmosphere at B, whence the emission of a secondary ray BC will barely reach the ground at A. But assuming the mean estimate of astronomers, that twilight expires when the solar depression or the arc CA amounts to eighteen degrees. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> COB, the base OC, or the radius of the globe being 3956, and the acute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> COB <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> degrees, or the half of AOC the hypotenuse OB is easily found, and hence about 49 miles is the excess BD of CB above CD, or the elevation of the boundary of the atmosphere, illumined by the latest beams of the sun. A correction might be required for the deviation of the rays from their rectilineal path, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the unequal refraction of the different strata of the atmosphere; but in a question of this kind, resting on rather loose or doubtful observations, it seems superfluous to affect any delicacy of calculation.\n\nThe inference drawn from the limits of twilight is Lambert's not so conclusive as might at first appear. The fee-investigable slanting rays, shed from the higher regions of the atmosphere, may not have been received directly from the sun, but derived, after repeated reflexions, from the more distant parts of the sky. The very ingenious Lambert attempted to distinguish, besides the primary twilight, a secondary, and even a ternary crepusculeum. It is easy to see, that the solar ray SA (Fig. S, Plate XCVII.), after grazing along the surface, will illuminate the upper atmosphere at B, from which some light will be darted in the direction of the tangent BCD, to tinge another elevated portion of the sky at D, which may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a few expiring rays to the spectator at E, or shoot onwards to the opposite sky at F, and thence reach in a state of almost extinction the ground at G. While the first crepusculeum, therefore, sets in the west, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> will travel like a bow over the heavens, followed at a regular distance by the dusky veil of the third, or the vanishing train of the fourth. But it may be computed, from the vast length of the tracks which the light would have to traverse, that those shades would in succession be ten thousand times darker. The clearest sky, however, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of evening, never appears marked by such contrasted boundaries. The vault of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> seems to darken by insensible transitions, from the western to the eastern horizon. It is most probable, therefore, that the diminution of light, after the close of evening, is owing to the prodigious rarefaction of much higher portions of the atmosphere, which still catch some faint rays of the sun, without being able, from excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENUATION\">attenuation</a>, to reflect them efficiently to the earth. But since, unless the sky be overcast, there is\ntotal darkness in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, even at midnight; we may, therefore, infer that the body of air extends to such an altitude, as to receive the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> glimmer, after the sun has attained its utmost obliquity, and sunk ninety degrees below the horizon. It would thence follow, that the elevation of the atmosphere, must be equal at least to 1638 miles, or the excess of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right-angled triangle having 956 miles, or the radius of the earth for its base.\n\nThis very great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of a rare expansive atmosphere appears conformable to the general phenomena. But the thin investure of our globe, at least, near the equator, may stretch out much farther; and yet its elevation can never exceed a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> limit. The highest portions of the atmosphere, which is carried round in 23 hours and 56 minutes, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of the earth about its axis, would be projected into space, if their centrifugal force at that distance were not less than their gravitation towards the centre. But the centrifugal force is directly as the distance, while the power of gravity is at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. Consequently, when the centrifugal force at the distance of 6.6 radii of the earth is augmented as many times, the corresponding gravitation is diminished by its square or 43.7 times, their relative proportion being thus changed to 289. Now, the centrifugal force being only the 289th part of gravity at the surface of the equator, it will therefore just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> this power at the distance of 6.6 radii from the centre, or at the elevation of 22,200 miles. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, fig. 7, Plate XCVII. will represent our globe encompassed by its atmosphere, of which the equatorial diameter extends from A and B.\n\nSuch is the extreme boundary of atmospheric expansion. Though it surpasses all our ordinary conceptions of the space occupied by that dilateable fluid, it yet scarcely exceeds the twentieth part of the distance of the moon, which was held by the ancients to communicate with our atmosphere. If it really spreads out to the limit now assigned, it must, in its remote verge, attain a degree of tenuity which would utterly baffle imagination to conceive. Perhaps the fluid itself may change in those lofty regions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into a sort of aetherial essence, more analogous to diffuse light than to a mass of air.\n\nThe constitution of the atmosphere forms the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of inquiry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of that rare medium is one of the finest discoveries of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>. It appears to consist of two distinct expansible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> combined in different proportions, a single portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> being united to three parts by weight, or four parts by bulk of azote. There is also a very slight admixture of carbonic acid gas, amounting to perhaps the thousandth part of the whole. It may be doubted, however, whether this analysis be complete. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of those gases obtained artificially generates a fluid in which we can hardly recognize the ordinary qualities of atmospheric air. Some fugacious elements must therefore escape during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of decomposition. Indeed, the air may be considered as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> solvent. It is the medium of all smells, and must therefore dissolve the different odorous effluvia, and transmit them to the olfactory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>. The presence of moisture may perhaps assist the solution, but the mass of air is still the great receptacle of those diffusive emanations. We can readily distinguish several earths and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>. Nay, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> themselves, especially when rubbed, emit peculiar odours. What can be more variously contrasted, for instance, than the smells of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, of tin, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>? The air must hence actually dissolve some traces of those metals, highly attenuated indeed, and almost evanescent. If a lump of assafoetida loses but a grain by exposure for several weeks, a bright surface of copper may, in similar circumstances, suffer the waste of only the thousandth part of a grain. The metal, if not encrusted by oxydation, would consequently experience a certain diminution, however small, in the course of ages.\n\nThe atmosphere is thus charged with emanations of all the various substances which it sweeps. To detect such dilute corpuscles wholly transcends the powers of chemical analysis. It seems probable, that the air holds some matters in more copious solution than others; and the phenomena of the aerolites lead us to suspect that it attracts iron and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICKEL\">nickel</a> with greater force than the rest of the metals. The quantity of those adventitious particles contained in a given mass of air may be exceedingly small, and yet the aggregate weight diffused through the whole atmosphere would form a considerable amount. It appears from numerous endometrical observations, which agree tolerably well when performed in a similar way, that the constitution of our atmosphere is the same in all places on the surface of the earth, and at every elevation which has been yet explored. Such experiments have been made at very distant points, repeated on the summits of the loftiest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and applied to portions of air brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by balloons from the altitude of five miles. The result is what we should expect from the perpetual agitation and commixing of the lower strata of the atmosphere.\n\nBut a variety of circumstances render it extremely probable, that an expanse, far above the region of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, is filled by some peculiar fluid, very different from the grosser element spread below. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> stars which are seen every clear night, the bolides, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIRE_BALLS\">fire-balls</a>, and the luminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> which not unfrequently occur, and which must traverse the sky at the height of several hundred miles, all seem to indicate the existence of a very ignitable medium. Nor is it difficult to conceive how such a collection of highly inflammable fluids could be formed. Not to mention the multiplied processes of art which emit those products, the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a> of nature is incessantly at work in generating and pouring forth hydrogen gas, and its various compounds. The volcanic mountains cover a considerable portion of the surface of the globe, and their innumerable spiracles, with scarcely any interruption, continue to discharge immense streams of inflammable aerial fluids, a great part of which escape conflagration. But, as hydrogen gas has little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> to common air, it rises upwards by its buoyancy, without suffering much loss in the passage through that fluid. The largeness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, and the celerity of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>, conspire to favour the ascent of those inflammable gases to the loftiest regions of the atmosphere.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the several quantities of astrono-\nmical refraction, at different altitudes, points to a similar conclusion. The refraction which the rays of light suffer in slanting across the higher regions of the air, is greater than what calculation assigns to the corresponding density of the medium. But the discrepancy would entirely disappear, if we suppose those strata to consist of hydrogen gas, which is known to possess, in a remarkable degree, the power of refracting.\n\nIt seems very probable, that the higher range of atmosphere has a sort of phosphorescent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, or shines with a certain feeble light, for some time, after it has been heated or excited by the incident rays of the sun. Such may be the principal cause, and not any reflex illumination, of that lucid glow which, even at midnight, is diffused over the clear canopy of heaven.\n\nThe phenomenon of what is called the zodiacal light, might, perhaps, be traced to the same source. That remarkable appearance, which is more conspicuous in the finer climates, and near the vernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, on the approach of evening, has often been ascribed to the extension of a supposed luminous atmosphere about the sun. But Laplace has shown, that such an atmosphere, far from stretching to our earth, would not even reach the orbit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>. The zodiacal light must therefore have only a terrestrial origin. Supposing the uppermost regions of our atmosphere to consist of diffuse inflammable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, we might infer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, that like the calcined sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARYTES\">barytes</a> and other incinerated substances, they are endued with a phosphorescent quality, and capable of scattering a lambent gleam on being excited by the beams of the sun. But this luminary darting perpendicular rays, will evidently affect most powerfully the range of atmosphere which occurs in his diurnal track. The expansion of the gaseous investure of our globe above the equator, will hence, from its vast elevation, be described in places even beyond the tropics, glowing with a gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. The luminous cone which converges from the sun to the distance of perhaps 30 or 40 degrees in the circle of the equator, gradually contracts and grows fainter in proportion as that body sinks farther below the horizon.\n\nIt thus appears, that the opinion entertained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers concerning the existence of a vast shining \u00e6thereal expanse beyond our atmosphere, is, with some modifications, consonant to the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. This is not the first occasion in which we have to admire, through the veil of poetical imagery, the sagacity and penetration of those early sages. It would be weakness to expect nice conclusions in the infancy of science; but it is arrogant presumption to regard all the efforts of unaided genius with disdain. Seldom has a discovery been made without some distant ray of anticipation.\n\nHaving ventured to state that the highest region of the ocean bed of the atmosphere is probably occupied by some very diffuse phosphorescent gas, we shall hazard a conjecture which will appear bolder, and even paradoxical,\u2014that perhaps air, in its most concentrated state, occupies the bottom of the ocean, and forms a vast bed, over which the incumbent waters roll. Air has actually been condensed above a hundred times, and during this process it betrayed no deviation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, that its elasticity is directly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to its density. There seems no reason, therefore, to doubt, that if an adequate compressive force could be exerted, air might be reduced to the thousandth part of its ordinary volume. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid would then be denser than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and, consequently, instead of rising, would fall through the liquid. Suppose, for instance, a bladder filled with air, and having a small bullet attached to it, were thrown into the sea; in continuing to sink, it would reach a depth where the enormous weight of the column of water would compress it to the same density with the surrounding mass; and if the bullet were now disengaged, the bladder would remain suspended in that stratum, or if carried a little lower, it would precipitate itself to the bottom.\n\nTo form some estimate of this singular event, a Hypothetical Estimate simple calculation will be required. Air, of the ordinary temperature, is 840 times <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than distilled water, and is therefore 865 times lighter than sea-water, assuming the density of this to be 1.03. But the mean pressure of the atmosphere being equal to that of a column of 34 feet of distilled water, is hence equal to the weight of a column of 32 feet of sea-water. Wherefore $32 \\times 864$, or 28,296 feet, is the depth of the ocean where the necessary compression would obtain. But a small correction must be applied, on account of the augmented density of the sea-water itself under the load of such a column. The logarithm of this density is found very nearly by multiplying the height of the column by six, and striking off <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> decimal places; whence the modulus of the compression of water may be reckoned 723,824 feet. Of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> number, the former depth is about the twenty-fifth part; consequently, to procure an equilibrium between the condensed air and the corresponding stratum of sea-water, it is requisite that the air should be contracted one twenty-fifth part more, or reduced to 901 times less than its ordinary volume. But $32 \\times 900 = 29,475$ feet, from which deduct the fiftieth part for the mean condensation of the column, and there remains 28,885 feet, the correct depth.\n\nThis computation is to be considered as only a near approximation, yet sufficiently accurate for the object in view. Nor shall we fatigue our readers by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of a strict formula, including exponentials. It is enough to mark the conclusion, that any portion of air carried five miles and a half below the surface of the sea will never ascend again. Now, this limit is only half the depth which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of tides assigns to the waters of the ocean. There is more difficulty in conceiving, by what process air can be conveyed to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a>. Increase of pressure, however, enables water to hold a larger share of air; and the effect is hence the same as an augmented attraction. The minute globules of air may therefore be gradually drawn downwards from stratum to stratum, till they are at last detached from the body of water by their own superior density. The precipitation and accumulation of concentrated air under the ocean would thus be the results of some unceasing operation. Such a pro-\ncess may perhaps constitute a part of the great economy of Nature. It seems probable, that the existence of a subaqueous bed of air is necessary to feed the numerous fires which continually rage in the bowels of the earth, and occasionally burst forth on the surface in volcanic spiracles.\n\nThe variable disposition of the atmosphere is the main cause of all the meteorological phenomena. It is of importance, therefore, to examine the theory and application of the different instruments which can be employed to explore the state of that medium. Some of these have been long in common use; but others of a more delicate and refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> are only beginning to be known, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, when generally adopted, to expand our views, by opening a store of new and ulterior prospects. The ordinary observations are confined to the weight and temperature of the air. There are other data still wanted, to determine at any time the actual condition of that medium. The dryness or humidity of the atmosphere, its brightness or degree of illumination, the different depth of the cerulean hue of the sky, and the variable disposition to chill the surface of the earth, by impressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> transmitted from the higher regions,\u2014these objects of inquiry should be conjoined with others of a more practical tendency, depending immediately on the mutable state of the weather. Such are the attempts to measure the daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> from the ground, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> which falls, and to mark the direction and indicate the force or velocity of wind. A complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of meteorological instruments will, therefore, include primarily the Barometer, Thermometer, Hygrometer, Photometer, \u00c6throscope, Cyanometer; and comprehend likewise the Altimeter, Rain-gage, Drosoimeter, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANEMOMETER\">Anemometer</a>. We shall review this series in the order of enumeration.\n\nI. Barometer.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> discovery of the weight and pressure of the atmosphere achieved by Torricelli in 1643, was the first step in the progress of meteorology to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a science. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">Prior</a> to that memorable period it rested on principles altogether loose and conjectural. But the construction of the barometer, as an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of observation, soon disclosed what was passing in the more elevated and distant regions of the atmosphere. The column of mercury, it was perceived, seldom remained long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, but rose and fell through a sensible space, according to the different state of the heavens. In fine calm weather it generally stood high, but commonly subsided a short while before rain or wind. The barometer came, therefore, to be regarded as a weather-glass, announcing the proximate changes of the sky; and owed its general reception to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>. Its indications, however, were found, by farther experience, to be liable to much uncertainty. Though the extreme depression of the mercurial column appears invariably to foretell the ravage of a hurricane, yet its partial variations often pass away without being followed either by rain or wind. The barometer, evidently can mark only the pressure of the atmosphere, and intimate, by consequence, the state of the weather, in as far as it depends on that cause.\n\nPhilosophers have eagerly sought to explain the fluctuations of the mercurial column. They have tried every principle that might appear to exert any influence in modifying the local weight of the atmosphere; but their very numerous attempts, it must be confessed, have hitherto proved singularly unsuccessful. It was requisite to show that such causes would not only give results of the kind expected, but were besides fully adequate to the production of the phenomena. In most instances, however, either none of those effects could have followed, or they would occur in a very inferior degree and disproportionate extent.\n\nAll the proposed explications of the changes of the barometer may, perhaps, be referred to three distinct sources; 1. The action of heat on the atmosphere; 2. The influence of moisture on that fluid; and, 3. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> made by its rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in wind. Now, the heating or cooling of the air above any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, could in no way affect its pressure. The only change occasioned would be in the density of the fluid; and by the influx of the portion below, or the efflux of a similar portion above, the pressure of the atmospheric column would soon become adjusted to an equilibrium with the surrounding mass. The diurnal variations of the barometer within the tropics, seldom exceeding the twentieth part of an inch, as they follow a different course from the progress of heat, are obviously not derived immediately from this cause. According to the accurate observations of Humboldt in South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, at all seasons the barometer falls from nine o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till four in the afternoon, it then rises till eleven at night, and from this time it again descends till half-past four in the morning, and next mounts till nine o'clock.\n\nThe transition of the air, from a state of dryness to and of its humidity, seemed to furnish the most plausible explanation of the changes of the mercurial column. But the indication of the barometer was, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, distinctly at variance with the ordinary feelings of men. Those who suffer under a delicate or enfeebled constitution are accustomed in damp weather to complain of the air as heavier and less elastic. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is, no doubt, metaphorical only, and descriptive of the disordered state of the nervous system; but it shows the utter fallacy of trusting in philosophical matters, to the loose results of vulgar observation and experience. Moisture, so far from loading the air by its weight, communicates, like heat, increased expansion, and elasticity. But, even supposing a column of air to become suddenly charged with humidity, before its subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> had, by diffusing it, produced an equilibrium, still the additional pressure would have been extremely small, not exceeding, at a moderate computation, the fifteenth part of a mercurial inch. Any transition of that medium, from dryness to humidity, would be quite inadequate, therefore, to the production of the effects actually observed.\n\nSome philosophers imagine that moisture, in separating from the air, ceases to press that fluid by its gravitation, and would hence explain the fall of the barometer on the formation of clouds and the precipitation of rain. But when the aqueous particles are disunited in their solvent, whether dispersed in\nminute globules, or collected in large drops, they must evidently descend till they acquire the celerity sufficient to maintain a resistance in the medium equal to their weight. The pressure of the whole atmospheric mass upon the surface of the earth must therefore continue exactly the same under all the changes of the constitution of the medium.\n\nThe combined action of winds seem at first to promise the most satisfactory explication of the variations of the barometer. It is evident, that opposite currents rushing to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, will occasion an accumulation of the air; and on the other hand, different streams flowing from any point must reduce the vertical column. But such conclusions are quite vague, without being subjected to the ordeal of calculation. Now it is easy to compute that a confluence of winds blowing at the rate of 50 miles an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and hence approaching to the violence of a hurricane, would be required to raise the barometer only the tenth part of an inch. The utmost power of a tempest could not, therefore, affect the mercurial column the twentieth-part of what is frequently remarked in such circumstances. But trifling as this influence appears, it would be still at variance with actual observation. So far from rising in strong winds, the barometer almost invariably sinks; and instead of continuing depressed in the place where those currents originate, and where a calm must prevail, it generally stands high.\n\nTo explain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the barometer during wind, a very ingenious idea has been proposed, which, being apparently confirmed by experiment, has obtained general reception. It is conceived, that a current of air, in sweeping over the surface of the earth, must cease to exert any vertical pressure. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> can hardly be reconciled with any strict principle in science, for the particles of air will not for a moment cease to gravitate, nor will any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> motion of them produce the slightest derangement in a perpendicular direction. A remarkable experiment, however, was made by the ingenious Mr Hauksbee about the beginning of the eighteenth century, \"showing, as he says, the cause of the descent of the mercury in the barometer, in a storm.\" Having connected the square box cisterns of two barometers by a horizontal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> pipe of three feet in length, he inserted in the side of one of the boxes another pipe opening outwards, and connected the opposite side with a pipe attached to the neck of a large globular receiver, into which three or four charges of atmosphere had been compressed. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the stop cock, the imprisoned air rushed with vehemence over the surface of the mercury in the cistern, and effected its escape, while both columns fell simultaneously about two inches, and gradually rose again as the force of the blast diminished. From this experiment Mr Hauksbee formally derives four distinct corollaries: 1. \"That we have hence a clear and natural account of the descent and vibrations of the mercury in violent storms and hurricanes;\" 2. \"That not only the different forces, but also the different directions, of the winds, are capable of producing a difference of the subsidence of the mercury;\" 3. \"That strong winds may affect the animal economy, upon this very account, of their altering the pressure of the atmosphere;\" and 4. \"That the weight of the atmosphere being diminished in one place, it is also as much diminished at the same time in another place, which holds a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the former.\"\n\nThis experiment has a specious appearance, and its fallacy might seem to warrant the conclusions drawn from it. But a closer examination dispels the illusion. Since the air had been condensed four times, it must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the receiver with the immense velocity of 2700 feet in a second, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of that with which air of the ordinary density would rush into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>. This is a rapidity, however, twenty times greater than the most tremendous hurricane. The very small change of the four hundredth part of an atmosphere would hence have been sufficient to produce the strongest wind ever observed, and therefore its influence in passing over the mercurial surface must have been quite insignificant.\n\nBut the experiment itself was absolutely fallacious. The peculiar result proceeded from a mere casual circumstance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> pipe from the mercurial cistern being wider than the pipe which introduced the current of air. This incidental arrangement is not mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the apparatus, and we have, therefore, caused the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> to be engraved on a reduced scale, not only to prove the fact which we have just stated, but also to warn experimenters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of noting scrupulously every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> circumstance blended in their operations. (See Fig. 2, Plate XCVI.) It is easy to perceive that the tube G, which discharges the air from the box F, is much wider than the tube E, which conveyed it from the receiver A. This air, previously condensed, and still restrained in its passage through E, on entering the cavity of the box, immediately expands beyond the limit of equilibrium, and finding an easy escape through G, allows that state of dilatation over the mercury during the time of the horizontal flow. But the air contained in the other cistern K, must, from its communication by the slender pipe I, suffer a like expansion, and, consequently, the columns L and H will, in the same time, subside equally.\n\nSuch is unquestionably the true explication of this similar extraordinary fact. Were any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> needed, it could easily be derived from a very simple experiment. Let A (Fig. 3, Plate XCVI.) be any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> of tin, suppose three inches long and two inches in diameter, having an open pipe inserted at B, a quarter of an inch wide, and perhaps two inches long, and another opposite pipe inserted at C, about three-eighths or half an inch wide, and one inch long; at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to these, a recurved glass tube or syphon, GHE, of the tenth of an inch bore, is cemented below, descending 12 inches, and rising again 6 inches to the open swell at E, which contains coloured water terminating at F. Holding the cylinder in a horizontal position, and applying the mouth at B, let a sudden blast be injected into the cavity, the water will rise instantly to G, thus showing the diminished pressure, and, consequently, the rarefaction of the air above it. But if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> D, with a narrow projection of perhaps only the eighth part of an inch, be adapted to the exit pipe C, on repeating the experi-\nment, an opposite effect will take place, and the column of water, so far from mounting to G, will now sink to H. It is evidently the difficulty of the escape through D, that occasions the accumulation of the air within the cylinder, and the consequent depression of the water in the syphon. These different results are perfectly analogous to the local fall or rise of the surface of a river occasioned by the widening or contracting of its channel.\n\nAfter the complete failure of so many theories for explaining the variations of the barometer, which it would be tiresome to enumerate, we may be charged with presumption in attempting the solution of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> that has racked and exhausted so much ingenuity. Yet in all these various efforts, a principle seems to have been overlooked, of extensive influence, accordant with the general phenomena, and sufficient, we think, on a close investigation, to produce the measure of effect which is required.\n\nIt is obvious, that a horizontal current of air must, from the globular form of the earth, continually deflect from its rectilineal course. But such a deflection, being precisely of the same nature as a centrifugal force, must hence diminish the weight or pressure of the fluid. The only question is to determine the amount of that disturbing influence. Though it should appear quite inconsiderable in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of a short space, it may yet accumulate to a very notable quantity through the wide extent over which the same wind is known to travel. Suppose a current to begin to flow from A (fig. 9, Plate XCVII.) in the direction of a tangent, it will successively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> from a rectilineal track at the points B, C, D, E, F, G, &c. on the surface of the earth. The particles of the fluid are, therefore, drawn incessantly from their course by the action of gravity. Their vertical pressure is consequently diminished, by the force spent in producing this deflection. Wherefore, during the prevalence of the wind, the atmospheric column will press with inferior weight at B than at A, at C than at B, at D than at C; thus gradually decreasing through the whole chain. Suppose the intervals AB, BC, CD, DE, &c. to be each of them a mile, and that the current reaches the points B, C, D, E, &c. in successive minutes, a celerity which frequently happens; the deflection at B, owing to the curvature of the earth, would be eight inches, or two-thirds of a foot; but the space through which a body would descend in a minute, by the action of gravity, is $60 \\times 60 \\times 16 = 57600$ feet, or 86400 times greater than the deviation from the tangent. Wherefore the atmospheric pressure would, on that hypothesis, be diminished by the 86400th part for each interval of a mile, from A to G. In the space of 288 miles this diminution would, consequently, be the 300th part of the incumbent weight; and over an extent of 2880 miles it would amount to the 30th part. If we assume the very probable estimate, that storms involve the whole region of the clouds, or attain an elevation of near three miles, the diminution of pressure, occasioned by a long series of deflections in the stream, would affect one-half of the atmosphere. Wherefore, a wind which has blown over a track of 2880 miles, at the rate of 60 miles an hour, might cause the mercurial column to subside half an inch. If the velocity of the wind were doubled, which is probably the limit of the most tremendous hurricane, the fall of the barometer would be four times greater, and amount to two inches.\n\nThat the same powerful wind can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> over an immense track of surface is well ascertained. The effects of a hurricane originating in the West Indies, at the distance of 5000 miles, have often been felt on our shores. But a wind arising at A must evidently be followed, at succeeding intervals, by a current from K, L, M, &c., the range of influence being thus extended over a larger track. During the flow of the air, the depression of the barometer at G will be maintained, or rather augmented.\n\nThese conclusions are perfectly accordant with the facts observed. It appears from comparing the most accurate registers, that the pressure of the atmosphere is subject to very nearly the same variations through a vast extent. A barometer may be considered as in unison with another placed at the distance of perhaps 200 or 300 miles, and the mercurial columns in both of them rise and fall by an almost simultaneous movement. But, in stormy weather, the separated barometers, however they may approximate in their indications, cannot absolutely correspond. The gradation of atmospheric pressure from G to F, from F to E, &c. may be very slow; and yet the minute differences may accumulate to a very sensible amount in the long range from G to A, or to M. Thus, though a barometer may stand only the twentieth part of an inch lower than another separated 200 miles, it would be half an inch below a barometer at the distance of 400 miles.\n\nThe theory now stated seems to furnish the most satisfactory explication of a great variety of phenomena. Thus the minute diurnal alternations, to which the barometer is subject within the Tropics, are caused by the influence of the land and sea breezes. During the heat of the day, those gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> blow from the ocean, and, therefore, near the shore, and in the interior of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, the mercurial column subsides. But after the vigour of the sun's beams has declined, they flow in an opposite direction, and consequently the mercury rises again. The fluctuations are only partial, however, because such breezes hold a very short, and do not perhaps extend beyond 100 or 200 miles.\n\nThe common remark that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east wind, so far from depressing the mercurial column, generally causes it to rise, might appear at variance with the principles which we have advanced. But that wind which really comes from the north has probably a short course, and may be dependant on a more extensive current which maintains a flow in the higher regions towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>. The existence of opposite streams, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the supposition of a wide spreading hurricane, may yet be admitted in local and partial derangements of the atmosphere.\n\nHitherto we have contemplated the winds, as describing only arcs of great circles about the earth; but they may be constrained to bend in smaller circles, and perhaps trace the parallels of latitude. Their flexure from a rectilineal course, being in this case augmented, they would in the same extent exert an influence proportionally greater on the barometer. Such, near the arctic regions, may\nbe the effect of a westerly wind of no very distant origin.\n\nThe same principles will explain the phenomena of eddies, whirlwinds, and tornados. Suppose (Fig. 4, Plate XVII.) a horizontal stream of air, rushing from A to B, meets a contrary current blowing from C to D, and that some obstacle, E, occurs in their line of separation. The flow will evidently diverge on both sides of E (see Figs. 5 & 6, Plate XVII.), till it swells by degrees into a vertiginous revolution. Such is the origin of the famous maelstrom, or whirlpool, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, occasioned by the meeting of opposite tides. The aerial vortices are evidently produced by a similar cause. If the opposite streams have equal force, the circulation will be maintained in the same spot; but if the one current flows with greater rapidity than the other, it will transport the vertiginous motion by the excess of its celerity. A motion of progression and revolution is thus upheld at the same time. Such appearances are frequently witnessed in summer, especially in the hotter climates. A whirlwind arises on a sudden, and runs over the surface of the ground, drawing into its vortex all the light substances which occur in the track. Immense havoc is often thus produced in the fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> and plantations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>. It is easy to show, that if \\( r \\) denote in feet the radius of the extreme circle described by the whirlwind, and \\( t \\) the time of circumvolution in seconds, the elasticity, or pressure of the column at the verge, will suffer a diminution corresponding to the fraction\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5r}{4t^2}\n\\]\n\nThe amount of this diminution over the whole base would be reduced to three-fourths; and consequently \\( h \\) expressing the height of the revolving column of air,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15rh}{16t^2}\n\\]\n\nwould represent the mean effect of centrifugal action. Suppose the whirlwind to have an elevation of 200 feet, and a radius of 50, and to circulate in three seconds, the diminished pressure would be equal to the weight of a column of\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15.80.200}{16.9} = 1040 \\text{ feet}.\n\\]\n\nThis example, assuming a celerity of 65 miles an hour, might be reckoned an extreme case, but it would occasion the mercury to sink in the barometer more than an inch, or 1.12.\n\nThe formula for the depression of the barometer caused by a rapid whirl or tornado in the lower atmosphere, may be changed into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> that shall embrace the velocity instead of the time of revolution. This velocity in miles each hour being denoted by \\( v \\), the diminished pressure of the vertiginous column will be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3v^2h}{50r}\n\\]\n\nIt thus appears that the effect is directly as the square of the celerity, and inversely as the radius of circumvolution. And since the rapidity of whirl can never exceed certain limits, the action of a tornado must diminish in proportion to the extent of surface which it occupies. Suppose the height of the cylinder of air to be 300 feet, the radius of the sweep 500 feet, and the celerity of its extreme circulation 80 miles an hour: Then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3.6400.300}{50.500} = 280 \\text{ feet},\n\\]\n\nwhich corresponds to a descent of 1.247, or about a quarter of an inch in the mercurial column.\n\nII. The Thermometer.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of this instrument has not only dispelled the illusions which formerly prevailed on the subject of heat, but has mightily contributed to extend our acquaintance with the actual condition of the atmosphere. A lump of iron brought into the house, from its exposure during a frosty night, feels intensely cold, yet becomes gradually warmer; and if it be put into the fire, it will soon grow extremely hot, till it acquires the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>; on removing it from the fire, and laying it again out of doors, it will, through all the steps of a contrary progress, relapse imperceptibly into its former state. This obvious fact, and many others of a similar kind, might have been sufficient to show that hot and cold are nearly relative conditions which every substance is capable of assuming. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> upheld very different notions, which, after a long series of descents, have at last found shelter among the vulgar. It was maintained that, of the four elements, air and fire are hot, and water and earth essentially cold; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> bodies, from their constitution, partake of those qualities in different degrees. While the senses were the sole arbiters of heat and cold, substances became classed according to the sensations which they excited. If a body, such as lead, rapidly abstracted heat from the touch, it was reckoned cold. But the same quality was likewise bestowed on other substances of a very different kind, for instance, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a>, because they affect the stomach with a sort of chilling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>. Soft wood and feathers might be deemed warm, since they draw off heat feebly from the touch; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a> was also ranged in the same class, because it stimulates the organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Such a confusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> disfigured physical science, and perverted the practice of medicine.\n\nThe construction of the air-thermometer, by the invention of famous Sanctorio of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, in 1590, was the commencement of a salutary revolution. As it was at first intended for exploring disease, it has ultimately rendered signal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the medical practitioners. About twenty years afterwards, those instruments were manufactured by Drebbel, who carried them from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> into England. They were very rude, however, and adapted to no constant scale, but regarded merely as weather-glasses. The discovery of the barometer opened new views, and showed that the former instruments marked the conjoint effects of heat and pressure. To distinguish the separate influence of heat, it became hence requisite to employ some different fluid from air. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALCOHOL\">Alcohol</a> was preferred, as being very expandible; and from the year 1655, thermometers consisting of rather wider tubes, terminating in balls or large bulbs filled with that liquid, were manufactured by Italian artists, who imitated an arbitrary standard adopted by the Academia del Cimento. Such thermometers were clumsy, and susceptible of only a low range. R\u00f6mer, who made the fine discovery of the progressive motion of light, proposed mercury as a fluid, sufficiently expandible, and capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> an intense degree of heat. The origin of the scale was then fixed at the melting point of ice or snow, and the scale itself divided into\ndegrees corresponding to the ten thousandth parts of the capacity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a>. Yet this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of construction seemed tedious, and liable to some inaccuracy. The capital improvement was made in 1724 by Fahrenheit, who took another standard point from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> of water under the mean pressure of the atmosphere. For many years that ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> manufactured thermometers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> on correct principles, very neat and small, adapted especially to medical purposes. The multitudes of young physicians who at that period studied in Holland, quickly dispersed them to every part of the globe. The observations thus obtained gave juster ideas of the comparative temperatures of different climates, and in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> reduced the exaggerations of travelers to moderate bounds. It thence appeared that the heat of the torrid zone was not so excessive, nor the cold of the arctic regions so intense, as had been commonly represented. The tropical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> could, therefore, enjoy in our hot-houses all the warmth of their native climate. The thermometer was first applied to direct the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORTICULTURE\">horticulture</a>, and afterwards extended to regulate the process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREWING\">brewing</a> and other arts more immediately depending on practical chemistry.\n\nQuicksilver was deemed preferable to alcohol in the filling of the thermometers, not only because of the wide range which it embraces, but on account of the remarkable property which it was afterwards found to possess, of expanding equably with equal accessions of heat. But it failed in the lower part of the scale. The reported sinking of the mercurial thermometer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> appeared to indicate an intensity of cold beyond all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. But the discovery made by Professor Braun, in 1759, of the actual congelation of mercury itself, reduced the extent of refrigeration to moderate limits. This fluid metal suffers a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> in passing into the state of solidity; and, therefore, though it freezes about 39 degrees below the zero of Fahrenheit, it yet shrinks through a space of more than a hundred degrees before it becomes fixed. As alcohol has never been congealed, though brought, in some experiments we could mention, to 150\u00b0 below zero, thermometers filled with it are now employed to explore, if not to measure, intense cold.\n\nMetallic thermometers are likewise well adapted for examining the state of the atmosphere. They are commonly constructed on the principle of the compensation balance of a chronometer, a spiral or circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> being composed of two soldered opposite plates of distinct metals, for instance of brass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> and platinum, which expand very differently under the action of heat, and therefore continually change their incurvation. Some instruments of this kind, made by Breguet at Paris, are remarkably elegant, and those more lately manufactured by that ingenious artist with a very slender form, surpass all other thermometers in the exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of their indications. Fig. 9, Plate XCVI. represents the first form, reduced to about the fourth part of its natural size. The main piece of mechanism is a circular spring, fixed at one end, and composed of steel and brass soldered together. The other end carries a clip, that acts on a short train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, which turn an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a> plate, the extent of the scale, including the range of atmospheric temperature. The dial with its index are shown by A; and B exhibits generally the interior mechanism. Fig. 4, Plate XCVI., delineates the latest improvement. To prevent the cracking, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISLOCATION\">dislocation</a> which a large motion of the spring sometimes occasions at the junction of the two metals, a thin plate of a third metal is interposed. Three plates, consisting of platinum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and silver, are united by the rolling press into a single ribbon, of the thickness of only 1200th part of an inch. The instrument is formed with about twenty-seven spires or circumvolutions of this very slender spring, bearing an index which travels in its circle over 50 centesimal degrees, or 90 degrees by Fahrenheit's scale. The metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> is, from its extreme tenuity, almost instantly penetrated by the impressions of heat or cold, and the sensibility of this thermometer accordingly surpasses all conception.\n\nIt is of much importance in keeping meteorological journals, to have thermometers that shall indicate the extreme changes which occur during the absence of the observer, such as the greatest heat of the day, and the lowest cold of the night. For this object, the metallic thermometers are easily adapted, since their index may push forward or draw back any moveable mark, and thus indicate the limits of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. Large mercurial thermometers also, if mounted like the wheel barometers to turn an index, will answer a similar purpose. But smaller instruments, though of a more complex construction, have been generally preferred. The Encyclopaedia contains a sufficient account of the Self-registering Thermometer proposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Cavendish in 1757, and of the more complete instrument described by Mr Six in 1782. The latter has now come into pretty general use, though we are sorry to remark, that it seems to have fallen into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of very inferior artists, the scale consisting merely of boxwood, rudely and inaccurately subdivided.\n\nBoth these instruments have been employed to ascertain the coldness of the ocean at great depths. It becomes requisite, however, to make some allowance for the contraction which the glass bulbs must suffer under the enormous compression of the superincumbent columns of water. This can easily be computed, from the effect of perhaps ten atmospheres in a condensing engine; and such corrections were actually applied to the observations made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Phipps' voyage in 1773 towards the North Pole. It is a matter of equal surprise and regret, that all such niceties were overlooked in the late expeditions of Captain Ross and Captain Parry to the arctic regions.\n\nThe simplest, and by far the best self-registering thermometers, though barely noticed in the Encyclopaedia, are those invented and constructed by the late Dr John Rutherford, of Middle Balilish, and first described in the Transactions of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, for the year 1794. The one which marks the minimum is filled with alcohol, and the other which indicates the maximum is filled with quicksilver; and they are both attached to the same frame, or, what is still better, affixed to separate frames, placed nearly horizontal, or rather elevated about five degrees, to prevent the separation of the thread of liquid. The tubes have bores from the 25th to the 15th part of an inch wide, and include a minute tapered or conical piece of ivory, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>...\nor blue enamel, about half an inch long. This mark having in either thermometer its base turned towards the bulb, is drawn to the lowest point by the alcohol, which again freely passes it; but it is always pushed forward to the highest limit by the mercury, which afterwards leaves it. These marks, however, are now made cylindrical, a little thickened at the ends, and about 3ths of an inch in length. (See fig. 7 and 8, Plate XCVI.) Fig. 7 exhibits the alcohol or minimum thermometer; and fig. 8 the one which indicates the maximum, and is filled with quicksilver.\n\nThis instrument was first employed by Dr Rutherford in some interesting experiments, to ascertain the temperature of germination, and determine the depth to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> penetrates into the ground in different soils and situations, at the suggestion of his neighbour, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, the very able and intelligent Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> in the University of Edinburgh, both of them proprietors in the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Kinross. The few instruments of this kind, for some time circulated, were made by the hands of the inventor; but artists have since learned to imitate and improve the original construction, and nothing is wanted now but to promote their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>. We regret that this very useful register-thermometer seems yet to be not so well known in London as it deserves.\n\nThe minutest changes which take place in the constitution of bodies are for the most part attended by corresponding alterations of temperature. To explore those abstruser operations of nature, which often betray the influence of more extensive principles, it was now requisite to improve the delicacy of the thermometer. To this object the writer of the present article had early turned his attention. At first he enlarged the capacity of the bulb, and thus procured degrees of such a size on the stem as to be capable of a very distinct subdivision. These instruments, however, received their impressions very slowly; and, therefore, tubes of extremely fine bores being selected, he had small bulbs blown, and filled with quicksilver, not in the ordinary way, but by the aid of a compressing force. With such exquisite thermometers, it was easy to procure much nicer observations, and to detect even the finer modifications of corpuscular action. But to include the usual range of temperature, it was necessary to draw the stem to an immoderate length. The attempt to remedy this inconvenience led to the construction of the first kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">differential</a> thermometer. The main object was evidently attained, if the mercury should always be made to start from some given point. The tube was, therefore, left open, and a cap adapted to the top containing a surplus portion of the fluid. When the thermometer was kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, this mercury closed round the orifice, and joined the thread in the stem, as in fig. 17, Plate XCVI. But when the instrument was reversed, the excluded fluid instantly separated, and sunk into the cavity under the top of the tube, as in fig. 16. In this situation, the descent of the mercurial thread in the stem marked the depression of temperature.\n\nA differential thermometer of this construction was used for three or four years, in a variety of experiments, without ever failing. But an open thermometer must be liable to some uncertainty, and unavoidably subject to a continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a>. The loose mercury will undergo a slow oxydation, while the bore of the tube is apt to be soiled and tarnished by the insensible introduction of moisture. Such an instrument, however, is well adapted for many researches.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1795, another form of the differential thermometer was devised, which, from its simplicity, its delicacy, and extensive application, has contributed essentially to the progress of physical and chemical science. This instrument is now so generally known, that a few remarks on its general construction will be here judged sufficient. The differential thermometer is a modification of the air thermometer, but susceptible of the impressions of heat only, and exempt altogether from the influence of the variations of atmospheric pressure. The tube to which the scale is applied has a bore of equal calibre, from the 50th to the 15th part of an inch wide, the other branch being commonly wider; the terminating balls are not less than four-tenths of an inch in diameter, and seldom exceeding an inch and a half. A glass tube, terminated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> containing air, is joined hermetically, or by the flame of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>, to another longer tube, terminated by a similar ball containing air also, but including a small portion of some coloured liquid. The tubes are then bent, generally into a recurved or double stem like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> U, and the liquid is adjusted to the proper height, by making bubbles of air pass from the one ball to the other, from the little enlargement of the bore left at the junction of the tubes. If both balls have the same temperature, the liquid must evidently remain stationary, but if the ball of the shorter tube be warmed, the air, expanding and exerting more elasticity, will depress the liquid in the stem; or if this ball be cooled, the air, by its contraction, allows the liquid to ascend, from the superior elasticity of the air contained in the opposite ball. The fall or rise of the liquid will, therefore, mark the excess of heat or cold in the adjacent ball, and the space through which it moves will measure the precise difference of temperature.*\n\nAlcohol and other volatile fluids were avoided in filling the tube, lest their vapour should affect the precision of the measurement.\n\n* It is not difficult to compute, in general, the size of the scale of the differential thermometer. Let the diameters of the two balls be expressed in inches by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the diameter of the bore of the tube being denoted by \\(d\\), and the measure of a centesimal degree by \\(x\\). The capacities of those balls, \\(\\sigma\\) representing the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, would hence be \\(\\frac{\\pi a^2}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi b^2}{6}\\); and the portion of liquid raised through the space \\(x\\) would be \\(\\frac{\\pi d^2 x}{4}\\). Consequently the opposite elasticities exerted are \\(\\frac{3d^2 x}{2a^2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3d^2 x}{2b^2}\\), or expressed by the altitudes of a column of sulphuric acid, of which 220 inches may be reckoned equiva-\nunequally the elasticity of the air contained in the balls, and thus disturb the accuracy of the indication. Linseed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, tinged with alkanet root, was first used; but it was found to be sluggish in its movements, leaving along the inside of the tube a sort of trail, which sometimes collected into globules. But the great objection to this and other fixed oils was, that they did not remain at the same point of the scale, but slowly shifted their place, owing, apparently, to a partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of air in one of the balls, while their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> tint was found to fade away by exposure to the light. Deliquate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, coloured with archil, was next employed, and with tolerable success. By degrees, however, it deposited the colouring matter, and became almost limpid. Hydrogen gas, instead of common air, was then adopted for filling the balls. This mode of construction prevented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of the colouring matter; but it was experienced to be troublesome, and attended with other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a>. After numerous discouraging trials, it was at last discovered, that strong sulphuric acid, tinged with carmine, fulfils every condition, remaining permanently stationary in contact with confined air, and never losing in the slightest degree its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> from the action of the strongest light. Since the year 1801, this liquid has been constantly used in the construction of the differential thermometer. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of striking effects, rather than scrupulous accuracy, is sought for, tinged alcohol, indeed, has in a very few cases been preferred, on account of the great facility and amplitude of its motions. But in every instance, a column of liquid, terminating in the cavity of one of the balls, or in a small cylindrical reservoir under it, was preferred, and not, as proposed by some experimenters, a single drop of the liquid, which forces its way through the bore by successive starts, and is therefore liable to much uncertainty and derangement.\n\nThe differential thermometer is capable of some diversity of form. It may consist either of a single branch, pendant or horizontal, or it may be bent into two perpendicular branches, whether contiguous or placed at a short distance. Since the motion of the column in the tube is occasioned by the difference of the elasticity of the air contained in the two balls, it is not essential that those balls should be of equal dimensions, for an equipoise must obtain whenever the augmented elasticity of the air of the hotter ball is balanced by its expansion, on the one hand, and the corresponding contraction in the opposite ball, joined to the pressure of the ascending column of the sulphuric acid. In general the balls are blown to a certain degree unequal, either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the particular instrument, or to please the eye; but in making observations, it must be kept invariably in the position for which it was designed, whether vertical or horizontal, since the pressure of the balancing column would be affected by an obliquity.\n\nThe differential thermometer, in its pendant form, and extended to a suitable length, from one foot, perhaps, to three or four feet, may be employed with great advantage in comparing the different temperatures of adjacent strata of air near the surface of the earth, during the progress and decline of the day; and to detect the variations in a cloudy or a clear sky, and those occasioned by winds, as modified by the quality of the ground, whether naked or clothed with vegetation. But the main use of this instrument in meteorological researches arises from the various modifications of which it is susceptible. The minute changes of temperature which it marks discover the existence and intensity of other disturbing causes. It is thus found, that fresh ploughed ground is more affected by the solar rays than a green sward, on which also the breeze has little influence.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> to the weight of the atmosphere, they become\n\n\\[ \\frac{660d^2x}{2a^3} + \\frac{660d^2x}{2b^3}, \\text{ or } \\frac{330d^2x}{a^3} + \\frac{330d^2x}{b^3}, \\]\n\nwherefore, since air expands one 250th part for each centesimal degree,\n\n\\[ \\frac{330d^2a^3x + 330d^2b^3x}{a^3b^3} + x = \\frac{220}{250}, \\]\n\nand by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>\n\n\\[ \\frac{22a^3b^3}{8250(d^2a^3 + d^2b^3) + 25a^3b^3}. \\]\n\nThis corresponds to ten of the millesimal degrees adopted for the differential thermometer, but the length of an hundred of those degrees which may be preferred as a larger basis for the scale will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{44a^3b^3}{1650(d^2a^3 + d^2b^3) + 5a^3b^3}. \\]\n\nSuppose \\( a = \\frac{3}{4}, b = \\frac{4}{3}, \\) and \\( d = \\frac{1}{35} \\) of an inch; then\n\n\\[ \\frac{44 \\times \\frac{27}{64} \\times \\frac{64}{27}}{1650 \\left( \\frac{1}{1225} \\right) \\left( \\frac{27}{64} + \\frac{64}{27} \\right) + 5 \\times \\frac{27}{64} \\times \\frac{64}{27}} = \\frac{44}{1650 \\times \\frac{4825}{1225} + 5} = \\frac{44}{3.76 + 5} = 5 \\text{ inches}. \\]\n\nIf the balls be of equal diameters, this expression for the length of an hundred degrees in inches will become simply\n\n\\[ \\frac{44a^3}{3300d^2 + 5a^3}. \\]\n\nThus, suppose \\( a = \\frac{4}{5} \\) and \\( d = \\frac{1}{30} \\) of an inch; then\n\n\\[ \\frac{44 \\times 512}{900 + 5 \\times 512} = 3.62 \\text{ inches}. \\]\n\nIf the density of the sulphuric acid were reduced from 1.85 to 162, the expression for the length of ten degrees would pass into this very simple form\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^2}{756d^2 + a^2}. \\]\nIII. The Hygrometer.\u2014The mutable condition of the atmosphere, as it inclines to dryness or humidity, is the main source of all the variety of meteorological phenomena. The changes which it undergoes with respect to moisture have a marked influence on a very numerous class of substances, and even on the animal frame. But unfortunately those indications are always vague, and often fallacious. To ascertain the portion of humidity which a given quantity of air holds, or is capable of sustaining, is a problem of the first importance; but our advances to the constructing of an instrument fit to measure with accuracy that disposition have been extremely slow.\n\nMost substances of a loose and spongy texture, or possessed of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> quality, are affected, though in very different degrees, by the presence of humidity. Accordingly the variations, both in weight and bulk, which absorbent bodies undergo, have been employed to indicate the disposition of the air with respect to moisture. For this reason, such substances are likewise termed hygroscopic; since they are always affected by the state of the ambient medium, though they may not precisely measure its degrees of humidity or dryness. But neither heat nor moisture is passively diffused, or yet shared among different bodies in equal proportions. From some experiments made by Professor Leslie, it appears that, under a like change of circumstances, 100 grains of ivory will attract from the atmosphere 7 grains of humidity; the same weight of boxwood, 14 grains; of eider down, 16; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, 18; and of beech, 28. Other substances, in their respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of absorption, exhibit still wider differences.\n\nThe dry or humid state of the air is therefore discovered, from the variable weight of certain bodies exposed to its influence. Rock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> has been applied to that purpose; but potash, the muriate of lime, sulphuric acid, and most of the deliquescent substances, whether in a solid or a liquid form, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> the most powerfully. Other materials of a firm or adhesive consistence manifest the same properties, though in a lower degree. Plates of slate-clay or of unglazed earthen-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, the shavings of box or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, wool or down,\u2014all act as hygrometers. But these substances, especially the harder kinds of them, unless they be extremely thin, receive their impressions very slowly, and hence they cannot mark with any precision the fleeting and momentary state of the ambient medium. Nor is the weight which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> by exposure proportioned to the real dampness of the air; for the measures of their successive absorption are found to increase in a most rapid progression, as they approach to the point of absolute humidity.\n\nBut to weigh the substances with the accuracy befitting such experiments, is a very delicate and troublesome operation. Those thin bodies are liable, besides, to become in time covered with dust, which, while it must evidently augment their weight, cannot be detached from them without injuring their slender texture. The increase of bulk which they acquire from the portion of moisture attracted into their substance, furnishes therefore a more certain and convenient indication of the state of the atmosphere. The solid vegetable and animal fibres are connected by a fine soft netting, in which the power of absorption appears chiefly to reside. Hence the presence of moisture always enlarges the breadth of such substances, without affecting in any sensible degree their length. This effect is visible in the swelling of a door by external dampness, and in the shrinking of a panel from the opposite cause. But the substances, such as paper or parchment, which have a diffuse or interlaced texture, are extended, by the absorption of humidity, almost equally in every direction. On the contrary, twisted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> and gut, being swelled by moisture, suffer a corresponding longitudinal contraction, accompanied likewise, if not confined, by some uncoiling of their fibres.\n\nAll these properties have severally been employed in the construction of hygrometers. The expansion of the thin cross sections of box or other hard wood, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> or of a slice of whale-bone, and the untwisting of the wild oat, of cat-gut, of a cord or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> thread, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of grass brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>,\u2014have at different times been used with various success. But the instruments so formed are either extremely dull in their motions, or if they acquire greater sensibility from the attenuation of their substance, they are likewise rendered the more subject to accidental injury and derangement; and all of them in time appear to lose insensibly their tone and proper action.\n\nAn attempt was lately made by Professor Leslie to revive the method of measuring the expansion of absorbent cohesive substances, by their enlargement of capacity when disposed into a thin shell; and, by successive steps, he carried the hygrometer thus formed to as high a state of improvement as perhaps such an imperfect instrument will admit. A piece of fine grained ivory, about an inch and quarter in length, was turned into an elongated spheroid, as thin as possible, weighing only 8 or 10 grains, but capable of containing, at its greatest expansion, about 300 grains of mercury; and the upper end, which was adapted to the body by means of a delicate screw, had a slender tube inserted, 6 or 8 inches long, and with a bore of nearly the 15th part of an inch in diameter. (See fig. 19, Plate XCVII.) The instrument being now fitted together, its elliptical shell was dipped into distilled water, or lapped round with a wet bit of linen, and after a considerable interval of time, filled with mercury to some convenient point near the bottom of the tube, where is fixed the beginning of the scale. The divisions themselves were ascertained by distinguishing the tube into spaces which correspond each of them to the thousandth part of the entire cavity, and equal to the measure of about three-tenths of a grain of mercury. The ordinary range of the\n\n* From \u1f51\u03b3\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, wet, or humid, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a measure. Hygrometer is distinguished from Hygroscope; the former measuring the humidity of the air, and the latter only vaguely marking its presence.\nscale included about 70 of those divisions. To the upper end of the tube was adapted a small ivory cap, which allowed the penetration of air, but prevented the escape of the mercury, and thereby rendered the instrument tolerably portable.\n\nThis hygroscope was largely, though rather slowly, affected by any change in the humidity of the ambient medium. As the air became drier, it attracted a portion of moisture from the shell or bulb of ivory, which, suffering in consequence a contraction, squeezed its contained mercury so much higher in the tube. But if, on the contrary, the air inclined more to dampness, the thin bulb imbibed moisture and swelled proportionally, allowing the quicksilver to subside towards its enlarged cavity. These variations, however, were very far from corresponding with the real measures of atmospheric dryness or humidity. Near the point of extreme dampness, the alterations of the hygroscope were much augmented; but they diminished rapidly, as the mercury approached the upper part of the scale. The contraction of the ivory answering to an equal rise in the dryness of the air, was found to be six times greater at the beginning of the scale than at the seventieth hygrosopic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>; and seemed in general to be inversely as the number of hygrometric degrees, reckoning from 20 below. Mr Leslie placed, therefore, another scale along the opposite side of the tube, the space between the zero and the seventieth division of the hygroscope being distinguished into 100 degrees, and corresponding to the unequal portions from the number 20 to 120 on a logarithmic line. This very singular property will be more easily conceived from the inspection of the figure. The scale might probably be extended farther by continuing the logarithmic divisions. Thus, 320 degrees by the hygrometer would answer to 108 of the hygroscope, or to a contraction of 108 parts in a thousand in the capacity of the bulb. But at the dryness of 300, the contraction of the ivory seemed never to exceed 105.\n\nBoxwood was likewise formed into a hygroscope, of the same shape and dimensions; but this absorbent material swells twice as much with moisture as ivory does, and therefore requires its inserted tube to be proportionally longer or wider. Its contractions are still more unequal than those of ivory. For, near the point of extreme humidity, those alterations in the capacity of the bulb appeared to be more than twenty times greater than, under like changes in the condition of the atmosphere, take place towards the upper part of the scale. The space included between the commencement and the hundred and fortieth millesimal division of the scale, might hence be marked with 100 hygrometric degrees corresponding to the decreasing portions of a logarithmic line from 5 to 105.\n\nIn noticing the rapidly declining contractions which ivory and box-wood undergo, Mr Leslie did not mean, however, to state the quantities with rigorous precision. Much time had been consumed in attempting to trace out the law of those gradations; and such experiments are rendered the more tedious, from the protracted action of the hygroscope, which often continues travelling slowly for the space of a quarter or even half an hour. This tardiness is indeed the great defect of all instruments of that nature, and utterly disqualifies them from every sort of delicate observation.\n\nThe very large expansions which the hygroscope shows on its approach to extreme humidity, explains in a satisfactory manner the injury which furniture and pieces of cabinet-work sustain from the prevalence of dampness. On the other hand, the slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> which the instrument undergoes in a medium of highly dry atmosphere, seems to have led most philosophers to believe that there is an absolute term of dryness, on the distance of which from the point of extreme moisture, they have generally founded the graduation of the different hygrosopes proposed by them. This opinion, however, is far from being correct, and might give occasion to most erroneous conclusions. No bounds can be set to the actual dryness of the air, or the quantity of moisture which it is capable of holding, which, by the joint application of heat and rarefaction, may be pushed to an almost indefinite extent.\n\nThe ivory hygroscope, after being for several hours immersed in air remarkably dry, was apt of a sudden to split longitudinally. But if the bulb endured such a range of contraction, it appeared in some instances to take at least another set, or to accommodate its constitution, by imperceptible changes, to the state of the surrounding medium.\n\nBut though the bulbous hygroscope is, in extreme cases, liable to much uncertainty and some risk, it may yet be used with visible advantage, in certain peculiar situations. The very sluggishness of the instrument, when the value of its divisions has been once ascertained, fits it so much the better for indicating the mean results. After being long exposed in situations hardly accessible, it may be conveniently transported for inspection, before it can suffer any sensible change. The hygroscope could be, therefore, employed with success, to discover the degree of humidity which prevails at considerable elevations in the atmosphere. It might be likewise used, for ascertaining readily the precise condition of various goods and commodities. Thus, if the bulb were introduced, for the space perhaps of half an hour, into a bag of wool, a sack of corn, or a bale of paper, it would, on being withdrawn from their contact, mark the dryness or humidity of those very absorbent substances.\n\nOther hygrosopic substances have at different times been proposed, which, though possessed of greater sensibility, are yet liable to the same general objections. Thus, quills, reeds, gold beaters' skin or pellicle, the skins of frogs, or the bladders of rats, were made to act like the bulbs of thermometers, and to cause, by their contraction or dilatation, as they inclined to dryness or humidity, the included quicksilver to rise or fall in rather a wide tube. These instruments, however, being subject to injury or derangement from the smallest accident, can scarcely be applied to any practical use.\n\nThe hygrosopes which depend on the elongation of the fibres are perhaps on the whole preferable. The slice of whalebone proposed by M. Deluc, and the human hair afterwards employed by M. de Saussure, are both of them sufficiently sensible to\nexternal impressions; but the difficulty is to determine the precise relation subsisting between those impressions and the state of the atmosphere. Humidity is not distributed in equal shares through the air and among the several absorbent substances exposed to its penetration; nor are the degrees of expansion which it communicates either uniform or proportional to its quantity. The graduation of such instruments, being thus in a great measure arbitrary, can furnish no correct data of the hygrometric state of the atmosphere. The assumption of two fixed extreme points as the basis of the scale is evidently erroneous. Air contained within a glass receiver may be rendered as damp as possible, by the copious aspersion of water on the sides; but it can never be absolutely deprived of its moisture, which adheres the more powerfully in proportion as it becomes diminished. Caustic alkalis, concentrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, and some of the deliquescent salts, aided by the action of heat, all render the air drier, but without being able to complete the desiccation. By the combined application of other agents, and even by mechanical pressure, the driest air can always be made to deposit some farther portion of moisture.\n\nM. de Saussure directed all the resources of his ingenuity to correct the anomalies of the instrument which he proposed, and at last succeeded, by multiplied precautions, in rendering it as perfect, perhaps, as its nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> will admit. The hair-hygroscope (for it is not entitled to the name of hygrometer) certainly shows mobility; but the degrees which it marks can afford no steady or tolerably correct estimate of the dryness of the atmosphere.*\n\nTo arrive at an accurate measure of the dryness of the air, it is necessary to pursue a different route. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">Steam</a>, in whatever way it be formed, whether by the application of heat, or the diminution of atmospheric pressure, has nearly the double of the elasticity of common air, or it would, under the same compressing force, occupy about twice as much space. In uniting with that fluid, and forming vapour, it must hence communicate an expansion exactly proportional to the quantity dissolved, or to the share of moisture required for the complete saturation of the air. This principle suggested to Mr Leslie the means of constructing an accurate hygrometer, to which his researches had been early directed. Inverting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>-tumbler, he ground the mouth perfectly flat, and having drilled a hole through the bottom, he cemented into it a syphon-gage, or slender recurved tube, with a narrow bore, and an intermediate swell or cavity, passing through a perforated cap of lead, and holding a portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> oil, tinged with alkanet root. (See Fig. 6, Plate XCVI., where it is represented half the natural size.) To form the scale, he divided 4-2 inches into an hundred equal parts; so that each degree corresponded to the ten thousandth part of the air's elasticity, the whole atmospheric pressure being equal to that of a column of the oil 420 inches in height. Having now spread a few drops of water over a surface of plate glass, and slipped the tumbler upon it, the included air quickly dissolved as much moisture as was sufficient for its saturation, and marked the expansion thence acquired, by forcing the oil to rise proportionally. The quantity of effect varied much, but was often very considerable, amounting, in fine weather, to 110 or 120 degrees. This little apparatus appeared to answer the purpose intended, but it was not portable, and it always required some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>. It soon gave way, therefore, to other instruments, which promised to be more easily and readily managed.\n\nAs an hygrometer of this kind exhibits the actual expansion or increase of elasticity, which the air acquires from complete humidification, it seemed calculated for indicating the variable power of a drier or a moister atmosphere in refracting the rays of light. The barometer and thermometer had long been employed to correct the quantity of refraction; but the application of an accurate hygrometer seemed no less necessary for delicate observations. An instrument of the composition now described was accordingly entrusted, in the course of the year 1794, to the late Dr Maskelyne, and deposited in the Royal Observatory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. Other objects, however, interfered, and an investigation, which promised important results, was never prosecuted on a regular and digested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>.\n\nThis instrument might be rendered still more accurate, by combining it with the principle of the differential thermometer. Let two similar tumblers (see fig. 5, Plate XCVI., where it is contracted to about the fourth part of its size). A and B, inverted and loaded, have their mouths ground to fit a glass plate, the air contained in each of them acting by its elasticity on the column of a curved tube, C, which connects their cavities. Slide both of these tumblers in a dry state upon their bases, dip a hair-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> in oil, and pass it round the outside of the mouth of A, to make it quite tight; then having removed B, and spread a few drops of water over its place, slip it on the plate again. The air included in B, now absorbing moisture, will continue to expand and to press upon the liquid column, till it has become absolutely saturated. Should any change take place in the temperature of the room during this process, it can have no effect in deranging the indication of the instrument, since it must influence precisely in the same degree the elasticity of the air contained in both balls, and thus produce an exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-balance.\n\nThis compound instrument is adapted to various delicate physical inquiries. In the union of different substances, a certain alteration of volume, however minute, almost invariably takes place. To ascertain such changes under various circumstances greatly ex-\n\n* From the few observations which we have yet had time to make with an instrument of this kind recently brought from Geneva, we are sorry to say, that it falls much below our expectations. Its motions are slow and irregular; and it seems to be little affected by very considerable alterations of the state of the encircling medium.\ntends our views of the empire of chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>. For instance, a small bit of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> introduced under one of the tumblers will mark its absorption of the air, by the consequent rising of the coloured liquid. But the tumbler being wetted over the inside, and a portion of dry, though not recent, charcoal, with a pared surface, placed within it, after the air has ceased to dilate from humidification, if the charcoal be brought in contact with water, the liquor will again rise, and continue for some time to indicate a renewed expansion. As the water is imbibed by the charcoal, minute globules of air will appear to escape. But if the water, by its insinuation, had merely dislodged the air from the pores, there would have been no change of volume, and consequently no alteration in the height of the liquid on the scale. Those aerial globules must have, therefore, expanded as they emerged, or they had existed in a state of condensation united to the charcoal.\n\nOn the other hand, if a roll of unsized paper, linen rags, slips of wood, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>-dust, be successively introduced under a tumbler in which a little water is easily shed, the coloured liquor will sink rapidly in proportion as the moisture is absorbed. In this case, there is an obvious diminution of volume, and an union produced between a liquid and a solid, quite analogous to chemical solution; whereas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPILLARY_ACTION\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> action, such as the ascent of water through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, is attended by no change whatever of the space occupied by the compound.\n\nAnother application of this instrument was to place under the tumbler separate capsules containing different substances, liquid or solid, which exert a mutual attraction. The included air in this case served as the vehicle of transfer, and a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> was supported, of a peculiar kind. The indications of this invisible process were variable, and often striking. But to enlarge on this subject would be foreign to our purpose. We have only taken the opportunity of noting a few of the results of an inquiry which was not pushed to any extent, but which deserves to be resumed, as likely to open new paths, and to unfold the more abstruse relations subsisting among different bodies.\n\nPhilosophers have long entertained very crude notions respecting the union of moisture with air, and the different circumstances which regulate or influence the process of evaporation. Dr Halley supposed that fire, uniting with the particles of water, communicates a vesicular constitution, which enables them to rise and spread through the atmosphere. A similar idea was entertained by Leibnitz, and was extended still farther by Musschenbroek and Desaguliers. Kratzenstein adopted the vesicular system in 1743, and endeavoured to calculate the attenuation of the fluid which should produce the requisite buoyancy. Hamberger, in 1750, advanced, however, a capital step, by rejecting that hypothesis entirely, and attributing evaporation at once to a real solution of moisture in the air. This simple theory was in the following year explained at large by Le Roi of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>, and fortified by some striking arguments drawn chiefly from analogy. In pursuance of his theory, he proposed to pour ice-cold water into a deep glass, and to ascertain the dryness of the air, by noting the depressed temperature at which the dewing or deposition of vapour began to form on the outside of the glass, or was again about to disappear. Could this method have been easily and nicely reduced to practice, it might certainly have furnished an accurate estimate of the hygrometer and state of the atmosphere.\n\nWallerius, in his researches, was drawn aside from the right path, by a fact first noticed by Musschenbroek, who asserted that evaporation is always more copious from a deep than from a shallow vessel; and this curious and apparently anomalous fact has been confirmed by other subsequent experiments. But he found from a series of careful observations, that the quantity of water exhaled in the same situation is exactly proportional to the extent of surface exposed. He likewise made some experiments which seemed to furnish an explication of the peculiarity remarked by Musschenbroek, though their force was not generally perceived at the time. But Richman rather darkened the subject by his strange conclusion, that the measure of evaporation depends on the difference merely between the temperature of the air and of the water, whether in excess or defect.\n\nIt was not difficult to perceive that evaporation is promoted by the application of heat, and the agitation of the aerial medium. No attempts, however, were made to determine the relation of that augmented effect to the actual velocity of the wind. But experiments on the influence which an increase of temperature exerts on the quantity of evaporation have been prosecuted with various success, by Lambert, Saussure, and Kirwan. The results thus obtained unfortunately differ very widely; and though the researches of the celebrated Naturalist of Geneva were those conducted with the most care and address, yet they seem, from the vagueness of their elements, not entitled to much confidence.\n\nIf the estimate of the causes which regulate the vague quantity of evaporation was unsatisfactory, still more perplexing appeared the ordinary account of the cold source of that depression of temperature which always accompanies the process. It was commonly referred to the operation of different concurring circumstances, among which the agitation of the air was conceived to perform the principal part. The dryness of that medium, on which we shall find the effect alone to depend, was in a great measure overlooked, or was confounded with other occasional agents. An evident confusion of ideas prevailed. The celerity of evaporation was mistaken for its intensity, and the coldness induced on the exhaling surface was viewed as the accumulated effect of a rapid dissipation of moisture. It was not perceived that in a free atmosphere, vaporization proceeds with unabated energy, while the corresponding depression of temperature must advance by a relaxing progression, since otherwise the accession of an accelerated movement might push it to any extent. A little reflection, indeed, should have convinced philosophers, that the reduced temperature caused by vaporization must, in given circumstances, have a certain limit beyond which it cannot pass. But simple as this conclusion may now appear, it had escaped the most sagacious inquirers. Even Saus-\nsure, a patient and accurate experimenter, persuaded himself that, when water evaporates slowly, the cold produced is scarcely perceptible. To render this sensible, therefore, he thought it necessary to accelerate evaporation. Inserting the ball of a thermometer in a wet sponge, and attaching a cord to its stem, he whirled it briskly round his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and thus produced a cold of 18 degrees by Fahrenheit's scale, which he considered as much greater than could be obtained by other processes.\n\nTo prosecute the inquiry, he had a sort of whirling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> constructed, of about five feet diameter, by means of which a thermometer with its bulb incased in wet sponge, could be made to revolve with the velocity of 40 feet in a second. This machine he was at the trouble and expense of having carried up to the summit of the Col-du-G\u00e9ant, where, during a residence of several days, he performed a series of interesting and valuable experiments. It did not occur to this philosopher, that by such a contrivance he was only creating to himself a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of unnecessary fatigue, and that his wet thermometer, if left simply at rest for the space of two or three minutes, would have indicated exactly the same results. By all his exertions, he merely shortened the very moderate time required for attaining its extreme limit of depression.\n\nSuch were the imperfect notions which still prevailed on the subject of evaporation, so late as the year 1796, the date of the publication of the last volume of the Voyages dans les Alpes. It is curious to remark, that Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, in his Lectures, never mentions the dryness of the air as any way promoting evaporation, but ascribes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of the process entirely to the warmth and agitation of that medium. His friend, Dr James Hutton, whose acuteness and penetration were conspicuous, had probably studied the phenomenon more closely. \"I never had a hygrometer,\" he says; \"but I used to amuse myself in walking in the fields, by observing the temperature of the air with the thermometer, and trying its dryness by the evaporation of water. The method I pursued was this: I had a thermometer included within a glass tube, hermetically sealed; this I held in a proper situation until it acquired the temperature of the atmosphere, and then I dipped it into a little water also cooled to the same temperature. I then exposed my thermometer, with its glass case wetted to a current of air; and I examined how much the evaporation of the atmosphere, by holding the ball of the thermometer, or the end of the tube in which the ball was inclosed towards the current of air; and I examined how much the evaporation from that glass tube cooled the ball of the thermometer which was included.\" He then proceeds to relate some hasty and very inaccurate observations made in this way. The passage now quoted occurs in a quarto volume, published in 1792, buried in a repulsive mass of diffuse reasoning and paradoxical speculation, unsupported by any definite experiment. But Dr Hutton had evidently considered it as a conjectural hint on which he laid little stress; for he speaks immediately afterwards of our possessing accurate hygrometers, which could not be admitted if the assumption he seemed to make had been strictly true.\n\nWhile such loose and imperfect notions prevailed respecting evaporation, it was expedient to review the process with attention, and analyse the several changes which accompany it. The depression of temperature which it always occasions had been hastily supposed to be proportional to the rate with which the moisture is dissipated, and to be therefore augmented by every circumstance that can accelerate this effect. But if water contained in a porous vessel expose on all sides its surface to a current of air, it will cool down to a certain point, and there its temperature will remain stationary. The rapidity of the current must no doubt hasten the term of equilibrium, but the degree of cold thus induced will be found still the same. A little reflection may discover how this takes place. It is well known that the conversion of water into steam is, in every case, attended by the absorption of the heat requisite to support a gaseous constitution. Though the humid surface has now ceased to grow colder, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of invisible vapour, and the corresponding abstraction of heat, still continue without intermission. The same medium, therefore, which transports the vapour, must also furnish the portion of heat required for its incessant formation. In fact, after the water has been once cooled down, each portion of the ambient air which comes to touch the evaporating surface must, from its contact with a substance so greatly denser than itself, be likewise cooled down to the same standard, and must hence communicate to the liquid its surplus heat, or the difference between the prior and the subsequent state of the solvent, which is proportioned to the diminution of temperature it has suffered. Every shell of air that in succession encircles the humid mass, while it absorbs, along with the moisture which it dissolves, the measure of heat to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> this into steam does at the same instant thus deposite an equal measure of its own heat, on the chill exhaling surface. The abstraction of heat by vaporization on the one hand, and its deposition on the other, at the surface of contact, are, therefore, opposite contemporaneous acts, which soon produce a mutual balance, and thereafter the resulting temperature continues without the smallest alteration. A rapid circulation of the evaporating medium may quicken the operation of those causes; but so long as it possesses the same drying quality, it cannot in any degree derange the resulting temperature. The heat deposited by the air on the humid surface becomes thus an accurate measure of the heat spent in vaporizing the portion of moisture required for the saturation of that solvent at its lowered temperature. The dryness of the air is, therefore, under all circumstances, precisely indicated, by the depression of temperature produced on a humid surface which has been exposed freely to its action.\n\nIt may insure perspicuity, however, to recapitulate the great principle on which the formation of the hygrometer depends.\u2014When water passes into steam or vapour, it enlarges its capacity, and absorbs a very large share of heat. Any body, therefore, having a wet surface, becomes generally colder, if exposed to the access of air. But this decrease of temperature soon attains a certain limit, where it continues stationary, though the dissipation of moisture still pro-\nceeds with undiminished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>. The same medium which transports the vapour must hence furnish also the portion of heat required for its incessant formation. In fact, after the humid surface has been cooled, each portion of the ambient air which comes to touch it, must likewise be cooled down to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the dense substratum. The addition of heat at the surface of contact is thus a contemporaneous act with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> by the process of vaporization; and it quickly advances to the same degree of intensity, after which a mutual balance of opposite effects is maintained, and the coldness hence induced continues unaltered. An augmented circulation of the evaporating medium may hasten the process; but while it has the same drying quality, it cannot in the least affect the depression of temperature. As soon as such an equilibrium is attained, the deposition of heat on the humid surface must become just equal to its abstraction. But this deposition is evidently proportional to the diminution of temperature, which is hence a measure of the share of heat abstracted, and therefore of the dryness of the air, or its distance from saturation.\n\nThis analysis of the process of evaporation appears so conclusive, as to banish all doubt and objection. But it was desirable to confirm the deductions of theory by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to direct observation. Accordingly, on setting the hygrometer upon a table in the middle of a room, and blowing from some distance against the wet ball with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of bellows, which had acquired the temperature of the apartment, the instrument still indicated the same measure of dryness. The experiment was repeated more accurately on a larger scale, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the hygrometer out of doors to the action of a strong and arid wind, a small screen being interposed and again removed, at short intervals of time, during which alternations no change whatever could be perceived in the quantity of the depression of temperature.\n\nHaving, therefore, ascertained the great law of evaporation, and proved that the coldness occasioned by it is not, in any degree, affected by agitation or other extraneous influence, nothing seemed wanting to construct an Hygrometer on just principles, but to contrive a thermometer that should mark the smallest alterations of temperature. At first Mr Leslie employed a very delicate thermometer with a short range, open at the top, where a small cap of glass or ivory was fixed, containing a small portion of surplus quicksilver. (See fig. 16 and 17, Plate XCVI.) When this thermometer was heated by the hand, till the thread of quicksilver filled the whole of the stem, and formed a little globule at the top; it was inverted as in fig. 17, and all the quicksilver united into one mass; but when it was restored, as in fig. 18, to its first position, the quicksilver fell back from the cap, and lodged about the end of the stem, leaving the bore completely filled. A cup (see fig. 1, Plate XCVI) made of thin porous earthen-ware, nearly of the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>'s thimble, but somewhat larger, and filled with water, was exposed to the air, while the thermometer lay beside it in a horizontal position. After a few minutes, the thermometer was lifted up and plunged vertically into the cup; and the thread of quicksilver, which had extended through the whole length of the bore, being, by this change of position, cut off at the top of the tube, immediately contracted, and marked, by the space of its descent, the diminution of temperature in the liquid.\n\nThe very severe winter of 1794-5 afforded Mr Leslie an opportunity of making experiments on the evaporation of ice; in the course of which, he was led to the construction of the differential thermometer, now so generally known. At first he employed it merely as an hygrometer, the one ball being always naked, and the other covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMBRIC\">cambric</a>, wetted as often as occasion required. These balls were about an inch and a half in diameter, and blown to the ends of the same tube, one of them having a projecting point or aperture, which was sealed, after the branches had been bent and a portion of coloured oil introduced. The graduation of the scale was determined, by placing the instrument erect between two boxes, each containing a body of water, which encompassed one of the balls, and by noticing the rise of the oil on changing the relative temperature of the bath. An hygrometer, thus formed, was sent to the late Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks, in the summer of 1795; and Mr Gilpin, clerk of the Royal Society, deposited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of it in their cabinet. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> is so rude and clumsy, as hardly to recall the original. In the hands of the inventor, however, the instrument was soon improved, and reduced to a convenient and portable size. He had the satisfaction of showing an hygrometer of this construction, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1796, to Dr James Hutton, only a few months before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that very ingenious philosopher, who was delighted with seeing the application of a principle which he readily comprehended, and which his sagacity had obscurely anticipated.\n\nBut the sluggishness of the oil, and its tendency to deposit its colouring matter, on exposure to the influence of light, still opposed obstacles to the perfection of this hygrometer. These were entirely removed, however, about the year 1801, by the substitution of concentrated sulphuric acid, tinged by carmine. The most powerful and continued action of the solar beams was found to produce no change whatever on that purplish liquid, when precluded from the access of the external air. Any improvements which have since been effected on this instrument consist chiefly in its mechanical arrangement, in the selection of the tubes, the better proportion of the balls, and the elegance and conciseness of the general shape.\n\nThe hygrometer has two distinct forms; the one Its Comportable and the other stationary. The former (see fig. 13, Plate XCVI,) having its balls in the same perpendicular line, is protected by a wooden or metallic case, and fitted for carrying in the pocket; two or three drops of pure water, from the tip of a quill or a hair pencil, being applied to the surface of the covered ball, and the instrument held exactly in a vertical position whenever it is used. The latter form (see fig. 12) is susceptible of rather greater accuracy, having its balls bent opposite ways at the same height. In some instances, it is preferable to retain merely the simplest form of the differential thermometer, the vertical stems being more distant, and the balls not reflected.\ntwo balls, since they occupy the same level, cannot be affected in the smallest degree, by the unequal temperatures of the different strata of air in a close heated room. After the covered ball has been wetted, the instrument will continue to perform unimpaired, for the space, perhaps, of two or three hours. The addition of a few drops of water will then restore its action. But the hygrometer may be made to supply itself with moisture. It is only wanted to pass some fibres of floss-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> close over the humid ball, and immerse them at the distance of a few inches in a tall glass decanter, full of water, with a stopper which leaves open a small projecting lip.\n\nThe hygrometer has its opposite balls made to exhibit nearly the same colour and opacity, in order to exclude the admixture of photometrical influence, or prevent any derangement which the unequal action of light might otherwise occasion. The naked ball is blown of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, or blue glass, and the papered one is externally covered with thin silk, of rather a fainter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, as it takes a deeper tint when moistened.\n\nThe theory which we have given of the hygrometer, corroborated by its accurate performance, might appear complete in every part. But the progress of science commonly detects the existence of some collateral causes which come to mingle their influence with the action of the great dominating principles. In our explication of the hygrometer, we stated that the same air which abstracts moisture, and consequently the portion of heat necessary to convert it into the gaseous form, must likewise communicate to the wet ball another portion of heat equal to its depression of temperature, which is hence maintained at a constant point. This analysis, however, involves the supposition that the air conveys heat from bodies, merely by its actual transfer. But having discovered that air transmits a certain share, at least, of the heat by a sort of pulsation, or internal tremor, depending on the quality of the surface from which the impression originates; it was requisite to examine anew the process of evaporation. The effect cannot be produced solely, by the quickened recession of the contiguous portions of the ambient medium. The conterminous air must communicate heat to the humid surface also by pulsation; and hence the balance of temperature would be liable to incidental variations, if moisture, with its embodied heat, were not likewise abstracted by some corresponding process. And such is the harmonious adaptation of these elements: The discharge of vapour appears to be subject precisely to the same conditions as the emission of heat, and in both cases the proximity of a vitreous or a metallic surface produces effects which are entirely similar. Let two pieces of thin mirror-glass, or what is called Dutch plate, be selected, about four inches and a half square; and having applied a smooth coat of tinfoil, four inches square, to one of these, cover them both with a layer of the thinnest goldbeater's skin, which will adhere closely on being wetted; and after it has again become dry, cut it on each into an exact square of four inches and a quarter: Now place the two glass plates horizontally in the opposite scales of a fine balance, and adjust them to an exact counterpoise: then, with a hair pencil, spread two grains of water over the surface of each pellicle: in a few seconds, the plate which is coated with tinfoil will preponderate, and after the former has lost all its moisture, this will be found to retain still three-tenths of a grain. The proximity of the subjacent metal to the humid surface, therefore, impedes the process of evaporation, in the ratio of 17 to 20; the very same as, in like circumstances, had been ascertained to be the retardation of the efflux of heat. From this and other experiments, we learn, that some constant portion from a humid surface is always abstracted by the pulsation of the aerial medium. The steam exhaled, in uniting with the air, communicates to this elastic fluid a sudden dilatation, which will continue to propagate itself in successive waves.\n\nIn farther illustration of this matter, cover with a thin pellicle of goldbeater's skin, both the balls of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PYROSCOPE\">pyroscope</a>, or that form of the differential thermometer which has one ball naked, and the other enamelled with gold or silver, and wet them equally. The coloured liquid will remain for several minutes stationary at the beginning of the scale, and will then mount slowly, perhaps 10 or 15 degrees. Evaporation had, therefore, produced the same cold or depression of temperature upon the surface of the metal as upon that of the glass; from the glass, however, it was more copious than from the metal, having left the former dry, while the latter still exhaled some portion of moisture. But this action soon ceased, and the liquid fell back to its former level. On applying another pellicle, the liquid continued longer stationary, and rose only about five degrees. With repeated pellicles a difference was perceptible in the time of drying the two balls, till the thickness amounted to the 600th part of an inch.\n\nThe method employed for the graduation of the hygrometer is not only very convenient, but susceptible of great accuracy. The instrument, with a temporary scale affixed to it, is introduced into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of dry air, and compared with a standard then put in action. To procure the dryness of the included medium, a flat saucer of thirteen inches in diameter, and holding a body, about half an inch deep, of concentrated sulphuric acid, and set on a ground plate of glass or metal, is covered by a very large inverted receiver, containing more than 1500 cubic inches of air, and having at the top an opening of three inches wide, on which rests a smaller plate, with two or three hooks projecting down from it. The scale of the standard instrument was determined, by suspending beside it under the receiver two delicate thermometers, one of which had its bulb coated with several folds of wet tissue paper. The descent of the coloured liquid of the hygrometer, corresponding to the difference of ten centesimal degrees of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> thermometers, was hence computed, and this length afterwards divided into a hundred equal parts, to form the standard degrees. To graduate any other instrument, it was only requisite to attach a scale of inches, and mark the simultaneous measures, when a steady equilibrium had at last obtained. The space of half an hour is generally sufficient to bring this about. A simple pro-\nportion, therefore, discovers the length answering to an hundred millesimal degrees, from which the subdivisions of each particular scale are derived.\n\nThe condition of the atmosphere with respect to dryness is extremely variable. In our climate, the hygrometer will, during winter, mark from 5 to 25 degrees; but, in the summer months, it will generally range between 15 and 55 degrees, and may even rise, on some particular days, as high as 80 or 90 degrees. On the continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, it maintains a much greater elevation; and in Upper India it has frequently stood at 160 degrees.\n\nWhen the indication of the hygrometer does not exceed 15 degrees, we are directed by our feelings to call the air damp; from 30 to 40 degrees we begin to reckon it dry; from 50 to 60 degrees we should account it very dry; and from 70 degrees upwards, we might consider it as intensely dry. A room is not comfortable, or perhaps wholesome, if it has less than 30 degrees of dryness; but the atmosphere of a warm occupied apartment will commonly produce an effect of upwards of 50 degrees.\n\nBut this hygrometer will perform its office even if it be exposed to frost. The moisture spreads over the surface, and imbibed into the coat of the papered ball, will first cool a few degrees below the freezing point, and then congeal quickly into a solid compound mass. The moment in which congelation begins, a portion of heat liberated in that act brings the ball back to the temperature of freezing, and the coloured liquor, in proportion to the coldness of the external air, starts up in the opposite stem, where it remains at the same height, till the process of consolidation is completed. After the icy crust has been formed, evaporation again goes regularly forward; and if new portions of water be applied, the ice will, from the union of those repeated films, acquire a thickness sufficient to last for several days. The temperature of the frozen coat becomes lowered in proportion to the dryness of the atmosphere. The measure of heat deposited on the chill surface by the contact of the ambient air is then counterbalanced by the two distinct, though conjoined measures of heat, abstracted in the successive acts of converting the exterior film of ice into water, and this water into steam; which transformations that minute portion must undergo, before it can unite with its gaseous solvent. But the heat required for the melting of ice being about the seventh part of what is consumed in the vaporization of water, it follows that the hygrometer, when the surface of its sentient ball has become frozen, will, in like circumstances, sink more than before by one degree in seven. This inference is entirely confirmed by observation. Suppose, in frosty weather, the hygrometer, placed on the outside of the window, to stand at 28 degrees; it may continue for some considerable time at that point, until the congelation of its humidity commences: but after this change has been effected, and the equilibrium again restored, the instrument will now mark 32 degrees.\n\nThe theory of this hygrometer will enable us to determine not only the relative, but even the absolute dryness of the air, or the quantity of moisture which it can absorb, by comparing the capacity of that solvent with the measure of heat required to convert a given portion of water into steam. To discover the capacity of air is, however, a problem of great difficulty, and it has not, perhaps, even yet been ascertained with much precision. It was formerly estimated, we are convinced, by far too high: Thus, Dr Crawford made it to be 1.85 times, or nearly double that of water. But from several concurring observations, we should reckon the capacity of air to be only three-tenth parts of that of water. But 600 centesimal degrees, or 6000 on the millesimal scale, being consumed in the vaporization of water, this measure of heat would prove sufficient to raise an equal mass of air 20,000 millesimal degrees, or those 6000 degrees augmented in the ratio of 10 to 3. Now, at the state of equilibrium, the quantity of heat that each portion of the aerial medium deposits in touching the chill exhaling surface, or what answers to the depression of temperature which it suffers from this contact, must, as we have seen, be exactly equal to the opposite measure of heat abstracted by it in dissolving its corresponding share of moisture. Wherefore, at the temperature of the wet ball, atmospheric air would take up moisture amounting to the 20,000th part of its weight, for each degree marked by the hygrometer. Thus, supposing the hygrometer to mark 50 degrees, the air would then require humidity equal to the 320th part of its weight for saturation at its reduced temperature. When the papered ball of the hygrometer is frozen, the degrees of this instrument must have their value increased by one-seventh, so that each of them will now correspond to an absorption of moisture equal to the 17,000th part of the weight of the air.\n\nBut the value of those degrees becomes augmented in a much higher proportion, if the hygrometer be immersed in hydrogen gas. This very dilute medium appears to have about eight times the capacity of common air, and the quantity of heat which, under similar circumstances, it will deposit on the evaporating surface, must likewise, from the same principle of mutual balance, be eight times greater, and consequently, each hygrometric degree will indicate an absorption of moisture equal in weight to the 750th part of the solvent. The energy of hydrogen gas is therefore scarcely less remarkable in dissolving moisture than in containing heat. Confined with a powerful absorbent substance, while common air marks 80 degrees of dryness, hydrogen gas will indicate 70. This gas must, in similar circumstances, therefore, hold in solution seven times as much moisture as the atmospheric medium.\n\nTo discover the precise law by which equal additions of heat augment the dryness of air or its power to retain moisture, is a problem of great delicacy and importance. Two different modes were employed in that investigation, but which led to the same results. The one was, in a large close room, to bring an hygrometer, conjoined with a thermometer, successively near to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a> intensely heated, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> the simultaneous indications of both instruments; or to employ two nice thermometers, placed beside each other, and having their bulbs covered respectively with dry and with wet cambric. By taking the mean of numerous observations, and inter-\npolating the intermediate quantities, the law of aqueous solution in air was laboriously traced. But the other method of investigation appeared better adapted for the higher temperatures. A thin hollow ball of tin, four inches in diameter, and having a very small neck, was neatly covered with linen; and, being filled with water nearly boiling, and a thermometer inserted, it was hung likewise in a spacious close room, and the rate of its cooling carefully marked. The experiment was next repeated, by suspending it to the end of a fine beam, and wetting with a hair pencil the surface of the linen, till brought in exact equipoise to some given weight in the opposite scale; ten grains being now taken out, the humid ball was allowed to rest against the point of a tapered glass tube, and the interval of time, with the corresponding diminution of temperature, observed, when it rose again to the position of equilibrium. The same operation was successively renewed; but, as the rapidity of the evaporation declined, five, and afterwards two, grains only were, at each trial, withdrawn from the scale. From such a series of facts, it was easy to estimate the quantities of moisture which the same air will dissolve at different temperatures, and also the corresponding measures of heat expended in the process of solution.\n\nBy connecting the range of observations, it would appear, that air has its dryness doubled at each rise of temperature, answering to 15 centesimal degrees. Thus, at the freezing point, air is capable of holding a portion of moisture represented by 100 degrees of the hygrometer; at the temperature of 15 centigrade, it could contain 200 such parts; at that of 30, it might dissolve 400; and, at 45 on the same scale, 800. Or, if we reckon by Fahrenheit's divisions, air absolutely humid holds, at the limit of congelation, the hundred and sixtieth part of its weight of moisture; at the temperature of 59 degrees, the eightieth part; at that of 86 degrees, the fortieth part; at that of 113 degrees, the twentieth part; and at that of 140 degrees, the tenth part. While the temperature, therefore, advances uniformly in arithmetical progression, the dissolving power which this communicates to the air, mounts with the accelerating rapidity of a geometrical series.\n\nIt hence follows, that, whatever be the actual condition of a mass of air, there must always exist some temperature at which it would become perfectly damp, as M. Leroi had first advanced. Nor is it difficult, from what has been already stated, to determine this dewing point in any given case. Thus, suppose the hygrometer to mark 52, while its wet ball has a temperature of 20 centesimal degrees or 68 by Fahrenheit; the dissolving power of air at this temperature being 252, its distance from absolute humidity will therefore be 200, which is the measure of solution answering to 15 centesimal degrees or 59 by Fahrenheit. The same air would consequently, at the depressed temperature of 59 degrees, shrink into a state of absolute saturation; and if cooled lower, it would even deposit a portion of its combined moisture, losing the eightieth part of its weight at the verge of freezing.\n\nAnnexed is a small table of the solvent power of air, from the temperature of 15 centesimal degrees below zero to 44 above it, or from -5\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's scale to 111\u00b0.\n\n| Temperature | Moisture |\n|-------------|----------|\n| -15         | 50.0     |\n| -14         | 52.4     |\n| -13         | 54.9     |\n| -12         | 57.4     |\n| -11         | 60.1     |\n| -10         | 63.0     |\n| -9          | 66.0     |\n| -8          | 69.1     |\n| -7          | 72.4     |\n| -6          | 75.8     |\n| -5          | 79.4     |\n| -4          | 83.1     |\n| -3          | 87.1     |\n| -2          | 91.2     |\n| -1          | 95.5     |\n\nThese temperatures, and the corresponding quantities of moisture dissolved, may be represented by the abscissae and ordinates of the logarithmic curve, as in fig. 8, Plate XCVII., where some of the principal terms are marked.\n\nThe influence of warmth in augmenting the dryness of the air, or its disposition to absorb moisture, affords also the most satisfactory explication of the singular fact already noticed. If two equal surfaces of water be exposed in the same situation, the one in a shallow, and the other in a deep vessel of metal or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a>; the latter is always found, after a certain interval of time, to have suffered contrary to what we might expect, more waste by evaporation than the former. Amidst all the changes that happen in the condition of the ambient medium, the shallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> must necessarily receive more completely than the deeper vessel, the chilling impressions of evaporation, since it exposes a smaller extent of dry surface to be partly heated up again by the contact of the air. The larger mass being, therefore, kept invariably warmer than the other, must in consequence support a more copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a>.\n\nFrom the principles which have been explained, it likewise results that the hygrometer does not indicate the actual dryness of the air, but only the dryness which it retains, after being reduced to the temperature of the humid ball. The real condition of the medium, however, could easily be determined, from the gradations already ascertained in the power of solution. Suppose, for example, that the hygrometer should mark 42 degrees, while the thermometer stands at 16 centigrade; the moist surface has therefore the temperature of 11.8 centigrade, at which the dissolving energy is less by 37 degrees than at 16 centigrade; and hence the total dryness of the air, at its former temperature, amounted to 79 degrees. The following table will greatly facilitate such reductions. It is computed for as wide a range of dryness and temperature as will probably occur in any climate.\n## Correction of the Hygrometer, and Position of the Point of Saturation at Different Centesimal

air 40 inches every way, or a little more than the standard of French measures, and of the ordinary density, weighs 20,000 grains. The table now given exhibits, therefore, in grains, the weight of moisture which a metrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of air is capable of holding at different temperatures. Thus, at 20\u00b0, which corresponds to 68\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, this body of air could retain 252 grains of humidity. But if a larger scale be preferred, the same numbers will express, in pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>, the quantity of water required to saturate a perfectly dry mass of air constituting a cube of twenty yards in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>.\n\nIt is remarkable how small a portion of the aqueous element is at any time suspended in the atmosphere. Reckoning the mean temperature over the surface of the globe to be 19 centesimal degrees, the air could only hold 240.6 parts of humidity for 20,000 times its whole weight; but this weight is nearly the same as that of a column of water of 400 inches in altitude; and hence, if the atmosphere, from a state of absolute dampness, were to pass into that of extreme dryness, and discharge the whole of its watery store, it would form a sheet of 4.812 inches, or somewhat less than 5 inches in depth. To furnish a sufficient supply of rain, the air must therefore undergo very frequent changes from dryness to humidity in the course of the year.\n\nBut it was requisite to subject theory to the test of accurate experiment. For this purpose, a globe or glass balloon was procured, of very large dimensions, containing nearly 4000 cubic inches, terminated by a neck of about three inches wide, having its mouth ground flat. The balloon was supported from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> by a light circular stand or rim, and a round piece of plate glass perforated through the centre by a hole of about the twentieth part of an inch in diameter, through which passed a slender silver wire suspended from the end of a fine beam placed on the table. This wire was fastened to the top of the scale of a delicate hygrometer, from the lower part of which hung a bit of wet paper nearly three inches in diameter. The whole was balanced by a counterpoise in the opposite scale, so that the instrument occupied the middle of the balloon. As the moisture gradually evaporated from the wet ball of the hygrometer, and still more from the larger surface of the paper attached below it, a loss of weight became visible, while the ascent of the coloured liquid in its tube indicated the corresponding diminution of the dryness of the included air. The progress of humefaction was observed from 50 to 10 degrees of the hygrometer, after each successive grain of water, amounting in all to five, had exhaled and dispersed itself through the medium. Having rectified the hygrometric degrees according to the principle already explained, it was easy to compare them with the weight of the whole mass of air contained within the balloon. The conclusions were, perhaps, as satisfactory as such a nice and fugacious inquiry will admit; and if they be not absolutely correct, they must, at least, approximate very nearly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. It would be superfluous, however, to engage in the details of the experiment, and of the calculations drawn from them; especially as it is intended to repeat the operation under more favourable circumstances, and with every precaution for assisting the equable dispersion of the moisture through the encircling medium.\n\nThe table given above is in strictness applicable modification to air only of the ordinary density. Since this fluid of the Table has its capacity for heat enlarged by rarefaction, the same depression of temperature must intimate a proportional augmentation of dryness. Thus, for air at the elevation of three miles and a half, and consequently twice as rare as at the surface, it would be requisite to add the sixteenth part to the numbers in the first column. For the lower altitudes, the correction will be, to multiply those numbers by triple the height in feet, and cut off six decimal places. Thus, suppose, while the thermometer stood at 28 centesimal degrees, that the hygrometer marked 110\u00b0 on the plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, at the elevation of 8000 feet above the level of the sea; then $3 \\times 8000 \\times 255 = 6120000$, which, being divided by a million, gives 6 to be added to 255, increasing the actual\ndryness to 261\u00b0. In most cases, therefore, this modification may be neglected.\n\nBut, in estimating the distance of the point of saturation in rarefied air, a greater correction will be required. The solvent power of that medium is extended about 50 hygrometric degrees, each time it has its rarefaction doubled. Hence, it may be calculated, that our atmosphere would at the same temperature become a degree drier for every 360 feet of ascent. Thus, on the preceding supposition, the air on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Mexico would have its distance from the point of saturation enlarged 22\u00bd degrees, its whole range being thus 283\u00bd degrees.\n\nIf the papered ball of an hygrometer be suffered to become dry, the instrument, even in that state, will mark, though for a short time only, the different condition of the media into which it is transported. Thus, the air of a room being supposed to have 50 degrees of dryness, on carrying the quiescent hygrometer into another apartment of 70 degrees, the column of liquor will fall near 20 degrees, from the renewed evaporation of that portion of moisture which had still adhered to the coats of paper. But if the same instrument were carried into an apartment of only 30 degrees of dryness, the coloured liquor would actually rise near 20 degrees above the beginning of the scale, the paper now attracting the excess of humidity from the air. This vapour, in combining with it, passes into the state of water, and therefore evolves a corresponding share of heat. The equilibrium, however, unless the coats of paper have a considerable thickness, is again restored in a very few minutes.\n\nThose changes are most readily perceived, on immersing the quiescent hygrometer alternately in two receivers containing air drier and damper than that of the room. If a pyroscope, having both its balls covered with goldbeater's skin, be treated in the same way, it will indicate an effect, though momentary indeed, of a similar kind: For, in air which is drier, the pellicle of the naked ball will throw off its moisture more freely than that of the gilt ball; and in damper air it will, on the contrary, imbibe the surplus humidity with greater eagerness; thus losing some portion of heat in the one process, and gaining a minute accession in the other. The quantity of moisture concerned in producing such fleeting alterations may not exceed the thousandth part of a grain.\n\nIf a large receiver, having a delicate hygrometer suspended within it, be placed on a brass plate and over a metal cup containing some water; the included air will, from the solution of the moisture, become gradually damper, and this progressive change is marked by the instrument. Yet the mass of air will never reach its term of absolute humidity, and before the hygrometer points at five degrees, the inside of the receiver appears covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>. While the humidifying process, therefore, still goes on, the close attraction of the glass continually robs the contiguous air of a portion of its moisture; so that, a kind of perpetual distillation is maintained through the aerial medium; the vapour successively formed being again condensed on the vitreous surface. But if, instead of the receiver, there be substituted a vessel formed of polished metal, the confined air will pass through every possible degree of humidity, and the hygrometer will, after some interval, arrive at the beginning of its scale.\n\nThe contrasted properties of a vitreous and a metallic surface, in attracting and repelling moisture, may be shown still more easily. In clear, calm weather, let a drinking glass and a silver cup be placed empty near the ground, on the approach of evening; and as the dampness begins to prevail, the glass will become insensibly obscured, and next wetted with profuse dew, before the metal has yet betrayed any traces of humidity. The effect is, indeed, augmented by the cold pulses darted from the sky, which act more powerfully on the glass than on the metal.\n\nThe hygrometer is an instrument of the greatest utility, not only in meteorological observations, but in aiding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> economy, in regulating many processes of art, and in directing the purchase and selection of various articles of produce. It will detect, for instance, the dampness of an apartment, and discover the condition of a magazine, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, or of a sick-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a>. Most warehouses require to be kept at a certain point of dryness, which is higher or lower according to the purposes for which they are designed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> of linen and cotton is carried on in very dry rooms; but the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> succeed best in air which rather inclines to dampness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> is at present entirely guided by observing the effects produced by stoves, and hence the goods are often shrivelled or otherwise injured before he can discern any alteration in the state of the medium. Wool and corn have their weight augmented sometimes as much as 10 or even 15 per cent. by the presence of moisture. But the condition of these commodities could be nicely and readily examined, by heaping them over a small wired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, within which an hygrometer is placed.\n\nV. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ATMOMETER\">Atmometer</a>.*\u2014This instrument is an useful auxiliary, and might with some attention serve as a substitute, of the Hygrometer. It does not mark the mere dryness of the air, but it measures the quantity of moisture exhaled from a humid surface in a given time. The atmometer consists of a thin ball of porous earthen-ware, two or three inches in diameter, with a small neck, to which is firmly cemented a long and rather wide glass tube, bearing divisions, each of them corresponding to an internal annular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, equal to a film of liquid that would cover the outer surface of the ball to the thickness of the thousandth part of an inch. (Fig. 8, Plate XCVII.) The divisions are marked by portions of quicksilver introduced, ascertained by a simple calculation, and they are numbered downwards to the extent of 100 to 200; to the top of the tube is fitted a brass cap, having a collar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, and which, after the cavity has been filled with distilled water, is screwed tight.\n\n* From \u1f00\u03c4\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, exhalation, or vapour, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a measure.\nThe outside of the ball being now wiped dry, the instrument is suspended out of doors, exposed to the free access of the air. In this state of action, the humidity transudes through the porous substance just as fast as it evaporates from the external surface; and this waste is measured by the corresponding descent of the water in the stem.\n\nIf the atmometer had its ball perfectly screened from the agitation of wind, its indications would be proportional to the dryness of the air at the lowered temperature of the humid surface; and the quantity of evaporation every hour, as expressed in thousand parts of an inch, would, when multiplied by 20, give the hygrometric measure. For example, in this climate, the mean dryness in winter being reckoned 15\u00b0, and in summer 40\u00b0, the daily exhalation from a sheltered spot must in winter form a thickness of .018, and amount in summer to .048 decimal parts of an inch. Suppose a pool for the supply of a navigable canal exposed a surface equal to ten English acres, and that the atmometer sank 80 parts during the lapse of 24 hours; the quantity of water exhaled in that time would be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{12000} \\times 660 \\times 66 \\times 10,\n\\]\n\nor 2904 cubic feet, which corresponds to the weight of 81 tons.\n\nThe dissipation of moisture is much accelerated by the agency of sweeping winds, the effect being sometimes augmented 5 or even 10 times. In general, this augmentation is proportional, as in the case of cooling, to the swiftness of the wind, the action of still air itself being reckoned equal to that produced by a celerity of 8 miles each hour. Hence the velocity of wind is easily computed, from a comparison of the indications of a hygrometer with an atmometer, or of a sheltered, with those of an exposed, atmometer. Thus, suppose the hygrometer to mark 40 degrees, or the column of water in a sheltered atmometer to subside at the rate of 2 divisions every hour, while in one exposed to the current, the descent is 12 divisions; then as 2 is to 10, the superadded effect of the wind, so is 8 to 40 miles, the distance through which it has travelled in that time.\n\nThe atmometer is an instrument evidently of extensive application and of great utility in practice. To ascertain with accuracy and readiness the quantity of evaporation from any surface in a given time, is an important acquisition, not only in meteorology, but in agriculture, and the various arts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. The rate of exhalation from the surface of the ground is scarcely of less consequence than the fall of rain, and a knowledge of it might often direct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> advantageously in his operations. On the rapid dispersion of moisture depends the efficacy of drying-houses, which are too frequently constructed most unskilfully, or on very mistaken principles.\n\nIt is obvious, that though the atmometer should be exposed to the free air, it must be sheltered from rain, which, by wetting the ball, would derange the proper action of the instrument. This could easily be done, by fixing a small canopy over it; or, in the case of drifting showers, to have a sort of shelved open screen, like Venetian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BLINDS\">blinds</a>, turned by the wind. The only objection to this atmometer is, that it cannot be used during intense frost, since the expansion of the included water, by a sudden congelation, might burst the ball and even the tube. But the instrument could still be made to act in another way: Let it be emptied, and a certain portion of the water, measured in the stem, be spread over the outside of the ball, by successive layers, to form a coat of ice. The time is to be noted when the whole of this crust has disappeared, or, if any portion should remain, it may be deducted from the whole, and thus the hourly quantity of evaporation ascertained.\n\nVI. PHOTOMETER.*\u2014This instrument, which was contrived to indicate the power of illumination, by the slight elevation of temperature which it occasions, has been shortly noticed in the article CLIMATE of this Supplement. It consists of a differential thermometer, having one of its balls diaphanous, and the other coated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, or rather blown of deep black enamel. (See fig. 17 and 18, Plate XCVI.) The rays which fall on the clear ball pass through it, without suffering obstruction; but those which strike the dark ball are stopt and absorbed at its surface, where, assuming a latent form, they act as heat. This heat will continue to accumulate, till its farther increase comes to be counterbalanced by an opposite dispersion, caused by the rise of temperature which the ball has come to acquire. At the point of equilibrium, therefore, the constant accessions of heat derived from the action of the incident light, are exactly equalled by the corresponding portions of it again abstracted in the subsequent process of cooling. But, in still air, the rate of cooling is, within moderate limits, proportioned to the excess of the temperature of the heated surface above that of the surrounding medium. Hence the space through which the coloured liquid sinks in the stem, will measure the momentary impressions of light or its actual intensity. To prevent any extraneous agitation of the air from accelerating the discharge of heat from the black ball, and thereby diminishing the quantity of aggregate effect, the instrument is always sheltered, and more especially out of doors, by a thin glass case. The addition of this translucent case is quite indispensable. It not only precludes all irregular action, but maintains, around the sentient part of the instrument, an atmosphere of perpetual calm. Under the same force of incident light, the temperature of the black ball must still rise to the same height above that of its encircling medium. The case will evidently have some influence to confine the heat actually received, and hence to warm up the internal air. Therefore, corresponding to this excess, the black ball will acquire a farther elevation of temperature; but the clear ball, being immersed in the same fluid, must expe-\n\n* From \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2, light, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a measure.\nexperience a similar effect, which will exactly counterbalance the former. The difference of temperature between the opposite balls thus continues unaltered; and neither has the size or the shape of the case, nor the variable state of the exterior atmosphere with respect to rest or agitation, any sensible influence to derange or modify the results exhibited by this delicate instrument.\n\nThe photometer has, like the hygrometer, two general forms: The stationary, represented by fig. 15, and the portable, delineated in fig. 18. But they are both of them easily transported from one place to another. Their glass cases can be screwed off, and the former instrument, being cemented into a small slip of brass, which slides with a spring into the bottom, may be packed separately, if required, while the latter is protected by an external wooden case, in which it is carried in the pocket as safely as a pencil. This case, if screwed below, serves also as a handle to hold the photometer in a vertical position out of doors.\n\nThe photometer, placed in open air, exhibits distinctly the progress of illumination from the morning's dawn to the full vigour of noon, and thence its gradual decline till evening has spread her mantle; it marks the growth of light from the winter solstice to the height of summer, and its subsequent decay through the dusky shades of autumn; and it enables us to compare, with numerical accuracy, the brightness of different countries,\u2014the brilliant sky of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> for instance, with the murky atmosphere of Holland.\n\nIn this climate, the direct impression of the sun about midsummer amounts to about 90 degrees; but it regularly declines as his rays become more oblique. The greatest force of the solar beams with us in the depth of winter reaches only to 25 degrees. At the altitude of 17 degrees, it is already reduced to one half; and at 3 degrees above the horizon, the whole effect exceeds not one millesimal degree.\n\nThe quantity of indirect light reflected from the sky, though extremely fluctuating in our climate, is often very considerable. It may be estimated at 30 or 40 degrees in summer, and 10 or 15 in winter. This secondary light is most powerful, when the sky is overspread with thin fleecy clouds; it is feeblest, either when the rays are obstructed by a mass of congregated vapours, or when the atmosphere is clear and of a deep azure tint. On the lofty summits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>, the photometer, screened from the sun, and only exposed to the dark hue of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> expanse, would indicate a very small effect.\n\nDuring the late solar eclipse of the 7th of September 1820, the sky being completely overclouded, it showed, both before and after the passage of the moon's disc, only 12 degrees of light; but when the obscuration was the greatest, it marked not more than a single degree.\n\nThe delicacy of this instrument renders it a valuable auxiliary in various scientific inquiries. It ascertains the diminution which the rays of light suffer in reflection, and during their passage through different transparent substances. By combining it with the transfer of an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, it likewise detects the comparative powers for conducting heat of the several gases, whether in their ordinary state, or when variously attenuated or condensed. Hence we learn, that air expanded 256 times conducts heat nearly twice as slow, or in the ratio of 7 to 13; but that hydrogen gas transfers it with more than redoubled celerity, or in the ratio of 9 to 4. But the photometer will measure also the conducting powers of different liquids. It is only wanted to remove the case, and plunge the instrument erect in a wide metallic vessel, bright on the outside, but blackened within, containing the liquid to be examined, and exposed to the sun's rays. In this way, it was found that water which conveys heat about 30 times faster than air of the mean temperature of our climate, transmits it with still greater rapidity if warmed to a higher pitch. If the photometer, inclosed within its case, be immersed under the surface of water, the impression of the light will be much stronger than when the balls were encircled by the actual contact of this liquid. Yet will the effect be less than if the case had been surrounded externally by a body of air instead of water, which, by its powerful action in drawing off the accumulated heat, hastens the transmission of it through the internal medium, and reduces the elevation of the temperature of the black ball to nearly one-third part.\n\nFrom observations made with this instrument, we likewise discover that, in the clearest and most serene sky, one-half only of the sun's light, sloping at an angle of 25\u00b0, will reach the ground; and that at an angle of 15\u00b0, the proportion is reduced to one-third; but with an obliquity of 5\u00b0, the length of track being then extended ten times, one-twentieth part only of the whole incident light can reach the surface. When the sun has approached within a degree of the horizon, and his rays now traverse a track of air equal in weight to a column of about 905 feet of water, no more than the 212th part of them can penetrate to the ground.\n\nThe photometer discovers the relative density of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> lights, and even contrasts their force of illumination with that of the solar rays. It may be mentioned as a curious inference, that the light emitted from the sun is 12,000 times more powerful than the flame of a wax-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>; or that, if a portion of the luminous solar matter, rather less than an inch in diameter, were transported to our planet, it would throw forth a blaze of light equal to the effect of 12,000 candles.\n\nTo compare the illumination of candles or lamps, and of the flame of coal or oil gas, the best form of the photometer, is that of fig. 15, Plate XCVL guarded both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> and behind by a pair of thin spreading plates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICA\">mica</a>, set parallel at the mutual interval of about half an inch. It may be sufficient to notice at present, that the flame of coal gas has more than triple the brilliancy of that of a wax-candle; but a series of experiments on this subject will be soon given to the public.\n\nA photometer of the branched form is easily adapted to measure the diminution which light suffers in penetrating through a body of water. The scale may then be shortened, and the balls enlarged. A bottom of lead is turned to receive the instrument, with its case, which are cemented to it. Thus loaded, the photometer is suspended vertically by cross silk-\nthreads, to which a cord of some definite length is attached, terminating by a small bladder. The sky being clear, and the sun shining bright, the instrument is, by help of a long pole, stretched from the side of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, held a few minutes suspended about four inches below the surface of the water, and then drawn up, and the number of degrees marked. When the direct action of the solar rays amounted to 90 photometric degrees, their enfeebled influence on the instrument, while thus encompassed externally by a dense chilling body of water, was commonly found to be reduced to 32 degrees. From this point, therefore, the subsequent diminution, occasioned by the descent of the instrument, was computed. The photometer, being let down, was left to float near a quarter of an hour at the depth of perhaps three or six fathoms. On drawing it up, the diminished action of the light, occasioned by the length of oblique passage, was at once perceived.\n\nFrom experiments performed in this way last summer, it follows that half of the incident light which might pass through a field of air of the ordinary density and 15\u00bd miles of extent, would penetrate only to the perpendicular depth of 15 feet in the clearest sea-water, which is, therefore, 5400 times less diaphanous than the atmospheric medium. The light is hence diminished four times for every five fathoms of vertical descent; and, consequently, the 64th part only could reach to the depth of 15 fathoms. Supposing the bottom then to consist of a clear white sand, the portion of light reflected, and sent back to the surface, would be attenuated more than $64 \\times 64$ or 4096 times, and would therefore hardly be perceptible to the most acute eye. But the water of shallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, though not apparently turbid, betrays a still greater opacity, insomuch that the perpendicular light was diminished one-half, in descending only through the space of six feet in Loch Leven, or even two feet in a fine artificial sheet of water at Raith, near Kirkaldy. These results, however, are to be considered as mere approximations, the state of the weather having been very unfavourable for such experiments.\n\nIt would be easy, by a small modification, to adapt the photometer as a diaphanometer, for measuring the comparative transparency of different collections of water. The black and the clear ball might be blown larger than usual, and the instrument covered with two thin parallel cases of glass, separated by an interval of about three-eighths of an inch. The transparency of a lake, or of the sea, would be inversely as the length of passage traversed by the light, when it had suffered a proportional diminution of intensity.\n\nVII. AETHRIOSCOPE.*\u2014Such is the name of another very delicate modification of the differential thermometer, intended to measure those frigorific impressions which are showered incessantly from the distant sky. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this invention, and of its progressive improvement, has been given already in this Supplement (Art. Climate). Since that time, few good observations have been added, owing to the very cloudy and windy weather which has prevailed for almost two years. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> object then was to render the aethrioscope more portable, in the hope of obtaining, through it, some correct information regarding the state of the atmosphere in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the globe. The upper ball is now scarcely half an inch in diameter; but to compensate for this diminution, the lower ball has a diameter of about four-fifths of an inch. The tube, which exceeds not four inches in length, has its bore contracted a little above its junction to the very short cylindrical cavity that holds the coloured liquor; this simple contrivance, augmenting greatly the capillary action, prevents the descent of the column into the ball from any sudden change of temperature, while it only retards the motion of the fluid, without affecting the accuracy of its play. Fig. 10, Plate XCVII. represents the instrument in this abridged form, and fig. 11 shows the way of packing it, the bottom being merely screwed to the top of the case. The only precaution needed, is not to shake the aethrioscope or invert it; and as it takes very little room, it may easily be carried by the traveller in his pocket. We may soon expect information, at once curious and interesting, from remote climates.\n\nIn ordinary cases, the hot or cold pulses propagated through the air only assist the energy of the transfer of the different portions of the fluid, in promoting an equilibrium of temperature. But the aethrioscope proves that those pulses are incessantly forwarding such a balance, even while the mere transfer and commixture of the medium would not contribute to the effect. In the article Climate, it was shown that the rapid interchange which takes place between the higher and lower strata of the atmosphere, maintains an equal distribution in the quantity, and not in the intensity, of heat. Since air has its capacity for heat increased by rarefaction, it must, with the same igneous infusion, indicate a proportionally depressed temperature. But this inequality of temperature, resulting from the internal commotion produced by the sun's rays acting more powerfully near the surface of the earth, is partly corrected by the influence of the cold or hot pulses, which are at all times darted and in every direction, unless obstructed or absorbed by the interposition of the clouds. While the cold pulses from the upper strata of the atmosphere are constantly chilling the lower strata, the warm pulses again from below are exerted in warming the higher regions. In most cases this mutual influence, indeed, is comparatively feeble; but if the rays of the sun were withdrawn for any considerable time, a great progress would be made by such a mutual interchange of the pulsations towards an equality of temperature through the mass of atmosphere. The lowest strata would become unusually colder, while the highest regions would grow warmer, and sparkle with augmented clearness and lustre. Such are some of the effects of the long protracted nights within the Arctic Circle.\n\nMuch yet remains to be explored in the higher Its Inverted Form.\n\n* From Aether, which signifies at once clear, dry, and cold.\nstrata of our atmosphere. If the differential thermometer, included within the athroscope, had its position reversed, that instrument would become adapted to measure the hot pulses, which are, no doubt, shot incessantly upwards with various obliquity from the warmer beds incumbent over the surface of the earth. It would be most interesting to obtain the reports of both the erect and the pendant opposite athroscope, when carried up in the car of a balloon to the elevation of four miles. In that region of mid-air, we might expect the hot and the cold pulses, as they crossed in opposite directions, to act with nearly equal energy. The measures of those effects, compared with the simultaneous indications of the photometer, could not fail to dispel much obscurity, and to open new views of the disposition of the elements, and of the economy of nature.\n\nVIII. CYANOMETER.*\u2014This instrument was contrived by M. de Saussure, to measure the variable intensity of the caerulean hue, which the sky assumes in different climates and elevations, according to the progress of the day or the advance of the season. It consists of 53 slips of paper of about a quarter of an inch broad, stained with the successive shades of blue, from the palest sapphire to the deepest azure, which are pasted around the circumference of a circle of pasteboard of about four inches in diameter. The colours were obtained from fine Prussian blue, diluting it with white chalk, or darkening it with a mixture of ivory black. He likewise compared those coloured spaces with the pure tints of a solution of copper in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>, which resemble most the soft transparent hues of the atmosphere. To represent the effect of clouds, and diffuse aqueous vapours, he dropped into that liquid a portion of very fine divided argillaceous earth, precipitated by ammonia from a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>.\n\nIn observing with the cyanometer, it should be held out of doors, between the eye and the part of the heavens which is to be compared, and, with a little practice, the corresponding tint is easily distinguished.\n\nIn this way, Saussure found, that the deepest blue of the zenith on the summit of Mont Blanc, at his station on the Col du Geant, at Chamouni, and at Geneva, corresponded respectively to the shades denoted 29, 37, 34, and 28\u00bd. From morning till noon, the colour of the vertical sky darkened, but became lighter again as the evening advanced; and this transition was wider and more rapid in great elevations. On the Col du Geant, the tint of the horizontal air at sunrise was 5, it deepened to 11\u00bd at noon, but again relapsed to 5 towards night. On the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, which was a very clear day, the atmosphere at the horizon had the 11th shade; at the altitude of 10\u00b0, the 20th; at that of 20\u00b0, the 31st; at that of 30\u00b0, the 34th; at that of 40\u00b0, the 37th; and thence with any sensible variation to the zenith. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Humboldt, in his voyage from Corumna to Cumana, found the tints of the sky to vary by the cyanometer, from 13 to 24, and again to 16, while the colour of the ocean fluctuated between 34 and 44.\n\nThe misfortune is, that we cannot annex any very distinct ideas to these numbers. We are not informed even of the proportions of the ingredients of the series of colours. The manner of composition likewise will modify the colorific effect; and most of the pigments, and especially the Prussian blue, not only want uniformity of tone, but are subject to great alteration. It would be quite impossible to paint with any water colours two cyanometers that should continue to agree, after being exposed for some time to the action of the air and the sun.\n\nIf an accurate method could be devised to discriminate colours, and mark their different tints with a sort of numerical precision, it would prove a valuable acquisition to philosophy and the arts. This was first attempted by the famous painter Leonardo da Vinci. Zahn proposed, in 1702, to accomplish it, by the graduating mixture of primary colours dispersed over the surface of a triangle; but he reckoned five of those colours, including black and white, with red, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and blue. The celebrated Professor Mayer of G\u00f6ttingen, after various trials, simplified the procedure in a posthumous work, published by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LICHTENBERG\">Lichtenberg</a> in 1775. Having distinguished each side of an equilateral triangle into 13 equal parts, he subdivided the whole space into 91 small triangles, which he painted with the successive mixtures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, ultra-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a>, and bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a>. Lambert assumed three colours, carmine, Prussian blue, and gamboge, to cover a triangular base, upon which he erected a coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>, having white planted at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>. But Dr Thomas Young, whose authority in those matters has deservedly great weight, prefers the simple triangle, and adopts red, green, and violet for the primary colours. Their binary combinations are yellow, formed by mixing red with green; crimson, consisting of red and violet; and blue, produced by blending green with violet. The difficulty, however, is to regulate the intensity of the compounds; nor can the powders be safely mixed except in a dry state, lest some chemical action should be introduced which might alter their tints. But the colours thus combined must evidently want the freshness and brilliancy of those which nature paints, or which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> reveals.\n\nAir, like water, is no doubt, by its constitution, a coloured fluid. The former is naturally blue, as the latter is green; but these colours acquire intensity only from the depth of the transparent mass. A small body of limpid water has the appearance of crystal, but in proportion as it accumulates, it assumes all the successive shades till it rivals the tints of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERYL\">beryl</a>. This gradation is distinctly seen in the profound lakes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, whose lustre is never stained by any vegetable infusion. The same series of colours emerges, on receding from our shores and approaching the vast abyss of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic Ocean</a>. At first, the water on the shelving banks is merely translucent; at the depth\n\n* From Kyan, caerulean or sky-blue, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a measure.\nof ten fathoms, it appears greenish, and the tint, by degrees, becomes more intense till it passes into a full green, at the depth of fifty fathoms; but beyond soundings, it darkens almost into azure.\n\nIn like manner, the blue shade of the air becomes more intense in proportion to the length of the tract of light. This we perceive in viewing distant objects, whose colours are always tinted by the deepening hues of the interjacent range of atmosphere. The remotest hills seem lost in a carulean vesture. The mixture of aqueous vapours only diffuses a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a>, which tarnishes rather than dilutes the fine blue.\n\nIt must be observed, that no substance can disclose its inherent colour, but by a sort of internal secretion or dissection of the rays of light. The mere reflexion from the surface of a solid body could never betray its tints, for when rendered most perfect by polish, it would only, like a mirror, send back unchanged the incident beams. To detect the subjacent colour, it is necessary that the particles of light should at least penetrate under the surface, and after suffering a sort of chemical separation, should be again emitted. In transparent substances, whether solid or fluid, the penetration is greater, but the mode of evolving the native colours must be still the same. The atmosphere, besides dispersing internally the blue rays, likewise reflects in various proportions the white light unaltered. This fact is established by some experiments of polarization, which show that such simple reflexions are the most copious from the portion of the sky which is 90 degrees from the sun, and regularly decline on either side to the opposite points, where they cease altogether.\n\nThe white, or compound beam of light, suffering in its passage through the air, a continual defalcation of the blue rays, must, as it advances, assume the complementary colour, or the tints of the remaining portions of the spectrum, and therefore merge successively into yellow, orange, red, and crimson. Such, accordingly, are the graduating colours of the solar rays, as they approach to their extreme obliquity. Near sun-setting, the shadow of a pencil along a blank card appears a bright azure on a lilac ground. When a diffuse attenuated vapour reflects the incident light unaltered, the western sky, as the sun declines from his altitude, glows with the successive shades of yellow and orange, which deepen finally into a blush red. These colours again may, under certain circumstances, come to be blended with the natural blue of the atmosphere. Hence the explication of a curious phenomenon, which rarely occurs in this climate,\u2014the existence of green clouds. This happens in the mornings and evenings, when a thin cloud is illuminated at once by the yellow rays of the sun and the bright azure of the upper sky, these contrasted colours producing a green by their mixture. For the same reason, sometimes a portion of the bright sky appears, in the finer climates, tinted with violet. This was remarked by Humboldt in his voyage to America, and we have had occasion to observe the same at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>. It was no doubt occasioned by the reddish rays of the declining sun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> the intense blue of the higher atmosphere.\n\nThe easiest and readiest way of ascertaining the tints of different portions of the sky, is perhaps to employ a sharp wedge of blue glass, of which the base and the parallel sides are painted black and cased with thin brass, and the slanting sides are ground to true planes and highly polished. To these angular surfaces two slides might be adapted, having each a broad slit, or intermediate opening, to permit the entrance and transmission of white light. Such rays having a greater length of passage to traverse, according to their distance from the top of the wedge, must emerge with a proportional intensity of blue. The scale would hence be determined by dividing the slides into ten or twenty equal parts, which might probably be sufficient.\n\nTo examine the orange and crimson tints which gild the east in the morning, or suffuse the western sky on the approach of evening, it would be necessary to combine a series of the complementary or accidental colours. A wedge of glass, stained of a gold-red or deep orange, might answer the purpose; or perhaps a nearer approximation would be obtained by joining two reversed wedges, one of an angle of 8 degrees, and crimson coloured, and another having only 3 degrees, but of a yellow body.\n\nThese instruments might be reduced to a very convenient size, not exceeding four inches in length; but they would require to be formed out of the same mass of glass, and exactly after the same pattern. With some skill in the execution, they could be made to unite elegance and correctness.\n\nIX. Anemometer.*\u2014Various attempts have been made to construct an instrument that should readily indicate the force and velocity of the wind. One method was to employ a very small model of a windmill, and either to reckon its revolutions, or to estimate its power by the application of a weight to a conical barrel or axis. But a more direct and accurate procedure consisted in measuring the impulse of wind against a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, as intimated by the contraction of a spiral spring. All these instruments, however, act with such extreme irregularity, as scarcely ever to furnish any definite results. They are, besides, racked by incessant motion, and soon put out of order.\n\nWe may notice, however, a material improvement made in this construction of the machine, by Mr Waddell, of the Trinity-House, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, who, amidst other objects of useful experimental inquiry, has long directed his ingenuity to ascertain the force and velocity of the wind. A circular plate, of four inches diameter, is opposed to the blast; but instead of pushing against a spring, it presses a fine cylindrical bag, of about an inch long, and the third part of an inch diameter, filled with quicksilver, and joined tight to a vertical tube of glass, a foot or 15 inches high; but having a bore only the 20th part\n\n* From \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, the wind, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a measure.\nof an inch wide. The compression of the bag caused by the impulse of the wind upon the plate, squeezes the quicksilver up into the tube, carrying with it a small steel mark, which slightly adheres to the sides of the bore. The height of the mercurial column, diminished in the ratio of the surface of the plate to the section of the bag, must evidently give the measure of the force of the wind. But, in the actual exposure of this anemometer, the quicksilver oscillates excessively, so that the extreme effects only are indicated. The instrument, however, is very sensible, and may continue to act for a long period without being impaired.\n\nThe direct action of the wind in supporting a column of water appears to furnish the best and simplest kind of anemometer. This principle was first employed, in 1731, by Pitot, the French engineer, in his recurved tube for estimating the force of the current of a river; and, forty years afterwards, it was applied by Dr Lind, to measure the impulse of a stream of air. With some modifications to correct, or at least to diminish, the oscillations of the liquid, this instrument is rendered quite manageable. The tube may consist of two pieces, each about a foot in height, having bores of the fiftieth and the fifth parts of an inch, the narrow piece being swelled out into a cylinder perhaps an inch wide, and two inches long, near the end where is joined hermetically to the other piece. The top of the narrow tube is bent horizontally, and cemented into the centre of a vertical circle of plate glass, of about three inches in diameter; or, instead of this plane, a hollow segment of a sphere of the same expansion, but including only 30 or 40 degrees, is substituted. The top of the wide tube is likewise bent horizontal, and drawn to a point at the same height as the minute central orifice of the cavity, and bent in the opposite direction. A portion of nut-oil, tinged by the alkanet root, had been previously introduced into the cylindrical cistern. On turning the small plate, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASON\">bason</a>, to front the wind, a condensation, corresponding to its force, is immediately produced on the opposing surface, a small portion of air enters the orifice, and continues to press upon the oil, till this rises to form an equiponderant column in the wide tube. As the air can with difficulty penetrate through the very narrow bore, the irregular action of the blast is, in a great measure, corrected, and the oil moves rather tardily.\n\nA scale is adapted bearing two sorts of divisions, the one indicating the impulse, and the other the velocity of the wind. Reckoning the weight of the atmosphere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to a column of oil of 400 inches in altitude, this space is subdivided into 10,000 equal portions, each degree thus corresponding to the 25th part of an inch. It would hence be easy to show, that the pressure of the wind upon every square foot of surface is expressed in pounds avoirdupois, by dividing by five the number of degrees through which the oil ascends.\n\nBut we may place an adjacent line of subdivisions that shall mark the velocity of the wind in miles each hour. Since air will rush into a vacuum, at the rate of 1350 feet in a second, it would, under a predominating pressure of the 100th part of an atmosphere, or at 100 degrees, flow with a celerity ten times less, or 135 feet in a second, which corresponds to 92 miles in an hour. Therefore, 25 degrees of the scale of impulse would be marked by a velocity of 46, and 6\u00bd degrees by that of 23 miles an hour. The subordinate divisions could hence be easily formed.\n\nSuch are the velocities which theory would assign to the different altitudes of the columns supported by the force of the wind. But the actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESISTANCE_OF_FLUIDS\">resistance of fluids</a>, owing chiefly to their detention at the obstructing surface, generally exceeds the result of calculation. In the case of water and air, the ratio of excess appears from experiment to be nearly that of 8 to 5. We may therefore modify the velocities after this proportion above stated. The relations of celerity and impulse will stand thus:\n\n| Celerity in Miles per Hour | Impulse in 10,000th Parts of the Weight of the Atmosphere |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 10                        | 1\u00b0.9                                                    |\n| 20                        | 7\u00b0.6                                                    |\n| 30                        | 17\u00b0.1                                                   |\n| 40                        | 30\u00b0.4                                                   |\n| 50                        | 47\u00b0.5                                                   |\n| 60                        | 68\u00b0.4                                                   |\n| 70                        | 93\u00b0                                                     |\n| 80                        | 121\u00b0.5                                                  |\n\nThis anemometer, being furnished with a vane to make it always face the wind, might also, by an index, point out the direction. Nor is it absolutely requisite that the instrument should be exposed out of doors. The funnel, with its vane, may have a socket of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-metal, nicely fitted to the top of a long perforated brass tube, which descends from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the house, and terminates below in the recurved tube and its double scale. The impressions of the wind would thus be conveyed with great regularity and undiminished effect to the surface of the oil. Still, however, it would be impossible to avoid entirely the oscillations of the liquid column. Even the steadiest wind will be found to blow with a reciprocating force, now swelling and again relaxing, and, at certain short intervals, concentrating all its vehemence.\n\nX. OMBROMETER,* or RAIN-GAUGE.\u2014A very simple instrument, contrived to indicate the quantity, or rather the depth, of the rain which falls upon any spot. It is likewise named Hydrometer, and has been sometimes called by the barbarous compound Pluviameter. It is composed generally of a circular bason of tinned iron, soldered to the top of a vertical cylinder, which is contracted in some given proportion and closed below. A small float is introduced, bearing a slender rod, distinguished by the corresponding divisions. In the most ordinary con-\n\n* From \u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, rain, and \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a measure.\nstruction, the basin being a foot wide, the attached cylinder has 3\u00bd inches in diameter, and its section is consequently ten times smaller. The inches on the rod are hence marked only tenth parts.\n\nThis method of measuring the fall of rain is evidently not susceptible of much accuracy; and it would require the gauge to be very frequently visited, on account of the loss of the water by continual evaporation. The more correct ombrometers have their basin made of brass, and turned to a fine sharp edge; the rain, as it falls, runs though a small orifice into the vertical cylinder, which has only about the fourth part of the diameter, and communicates, by means of a cock, with another perpendicular tube still narrower, and consisting of glass having a scale affixed. The divisions of this scale are determined from the proportion of the joint sections of the cylinder and tube to the horizontal surface of the basin. In making an observation, the cock being turned, lets the collected water rise to the same level in the glass tube, and thus indicate its quantity, which, by another operation, is now drawn off. In the time of frost or snow, it becomes necessary to warm the instrument gently, and make the water flow.\n\nWe may suspect that the measure of the rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, or snowy flakes received by the ombrometer, is not exactly proportioned to the extent of surface which it presents, for, while torrents pour down from the heavens, an eddy plays about the rim of the basin, deranging the regularity of the discharge. A basin of several feet in diameter would perhaps be preferable; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> of a roof could be adopted, if it were sufficiently sloped to allow the rain to collect quickly.\n\nBut the most perplexing circumstance affecting the ombrometer is, that it has been found to indicate very different quantities of rain as falling upon the very same spot, according to the different elevation at which it was placed. In general, less rain is collected in high than in low situations, even though the difference of altitude should be inconsiderable. Thus it was discovered, that, in the space of a year, while 12.1 inches only fell on the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>, 18.1 inches were collected on the roof of a house sixteen feet lower, and even 22.6 inches of rain at the ground. Similar observations have been made at the summit and near the base of hills of no great elevation. In such situations, we can hardly suppose the clouds to stretch down to the surface, or to augment the lower portion of rain. We must hence refer the copious fall near the ground to some other cause. Most of the rain which falls proceeds from drifting showers of short duration. The current moves more slowly along the surface, and allows the drops to descend as fast as they are formed. But being forced to mount a swelling eminence, and thus compressed into a narrower stream, it hurries the mass of vapour along with it, and does not suffer the free or full discharge on the summit. On both sides of the hill, an ombrometer placed near the bottom indicates always a greater fall of rain than on the exposed top.\n\nThe observations furnished by this instrument are hence liable to considerable inaccuracy, unless made in an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Thus, a register kept at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KESWICK\">Keswick</a> gives 67\u00bd inches, which evidently exceeds greatly the annual fall of rain in that district; the quantity at Carlisle, not 25 miles distant, being only 20 inches. Again, the measures of rain, being 33 and 34\u00bd inches in the open country about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, are found to amount to 45 and 60 inches at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a>, which approach the flanks of a mountainous range. In general, twice as much rain falls on the western as on the eastern side of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> annual quantity may be reckoned at 30 inches, or it would form, if all collected, a sheet of water of that depth. According to this estimate, the whole discharge from the clouds in the course of a year, on every square mile of the surface of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, would, at a medium, be 1,944,643, or nearly two millions of tons. This gives about three thousand tons of water for each English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>.\n\nXI. ELECTROMETER, which detects the electrical state of the lower atmosphere.

The degraded money having been in circulation for about sixteen\n\n---\n\n* Originally printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> in 1749, in 4to, and reprinted with some additions in 1810.\n\n\u2020 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LAMP\">Lamp</a>.

No wonder, therefore, that those who were in the situation of debtors should have declared their repugnance to submit to so shameful an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of injustice as was done them by this enhancement of the value of money, and that they should have refused to make good their engagements, otherwise than in money of the value of that which had been current at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when they were entered into. The labouring class, to whom every sudden rise in the value of money is always injurious, having joined the debtors in their opposition, they broke out into open rebellion. \"The people,\" says Le Blanc, \"being reduced to despair, and having no longer anything to care for, lost the respect due to the edict of his Majesty;\u2014they pillaged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the mint, who was believed to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> adviser of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, besieged the temple, in which the King lodged, and did all that an infuriated populace is capable of doing.\" (Trait\u00e9 Historique des Monnoyes de France, p. 190.) The sedition was ultimately suppressed; but it is not mentioned whether any abatement was made, by authority, from the claims of the creditors, in the contracts entered into when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> money was in circulation. It seems probable, however, from what is elsewhere mentioned by Le Blanc (Introduction, p. 30), that such was really the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the French coinage affords several instances similar to the very remarkable one we have now brought under the notice of our readers; but, in England, the new coinage in the last year of the reign of Edward VI. is the only instance in which the value of money has been augmented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> interference of government. Previously to the accession of Henry VIII., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of standard silver bullion, containing 11 oz. 2 dwts. of pure silver, and 18 dwts. of alloy, was coined into thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> shillings and sixpence. But Henry not only increased the number of shillings coined out of a pound weight of silver, but also debased its purity. The degradation was increased under his son and successor, Edward VI., in the fifth year of whose reign, seventy-two shillings were coined out of a pound weight of bullion; but this bullion only contained three ounces of pure silver to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> ounces of alloy; so that, in fact, twenty of these shillings were only equal to 4s. 7\u00bdd. of our present money, including the seigniorage. (Folkes's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> of English Coins, p. 34.) It appears from the proclamations issued at the time, and from other authentic documents, that this excessive reduction of the value of silver money had been productive of the greatest confusion. A maximum was set on the price of corn and other necessaries; and letters were sent to the gentlemen of the different counties, desiring them to punish those who refused to carry their grain to market. But it was soon found to be quite impossible to remedy these disorders otherwise than by withdrawing the base money from circulation. This was accordingly resolved upon; and, in 1552, new coins were issued, the silver of which was restored to the old standard of purity, and which, though less valuable than those in circulation during the early part of the reign of Henry VIII., were above four times the value of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> proportion of the same denomination that had been in circulation for some years before.\n\nIt is clear to demonstration, however, that such a rise in the value of money could not have taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> without occasioning the most violent commotions, had all the coins previously in circulation been debased. Equal injustice, it must be remembered, is always done to the poorest, and not least numerous class of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, by increasing the value of money, as is done to the wealthier classes by depressing it. But, although government had been disposed to sanction so enormous an invasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, it is altogether impossible that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> could have submitted to have had 400 or 450 per cent. added to its taxes and other public burdens, by a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEGERDEMAIN\">legerdemain</a> of this kind, or that individuals would have consented to pay so much more than they had originally bargained for. Instead of deserving praise for accomplishing such a measure, Edward VI., by whom the reformation of the coins was begun, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, by whom it was completed, would have justly forfeited the esteem of their subjects, and merited the deepest execration. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, however, that almost no change had been made, during all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, in the value of the gold coins; and there is, besides, abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> to show, that a large supply of the old silver coins had remained in circulation. Now, as there is no mention made of the issue of the new coins having been attended with any inconvenience, it is nearly certain, as Mr Harris has remarked, that, during the period of the debasement of the standard, individuals had regulated their contracts chiefly with reference to the gold or old silver coins; or, which is the same thing, that \"they had endeavoured, as well as they could, to keep by the standard, as it had been fixed in the preceding times.\" (Harris On Coins, Part II. p. 3.)\n\nWe have been thus particular in examining this measure, because it has, of late, been much referred to. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, however, that it can give no support to the arguments of those who have appealed to it as affording a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the benefits which they affirm must always result from restoring a debased or degraded currency to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> purity or weight. Invariability of value is the great desideratum in a currency. To elevate the standard after it has been for a considerable period depressed, is really not a measure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, but the giving a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to injustice. It vitiates and falsifies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in one set of contracts, in order properly to adjust those in some other set!\n\nThis, however, as we have already remarked, is the only instance in which the government of England has ever interfered directly to enhance the value of money. In every other case, where they have tampered with the standard, it has been to lower its value, or, which comes to the same thing, to reduce their own debts and those of their subjects.\n\nIt is unnecessary to enumerate in detail the various bad consequences that must have resulted from these successive changes in the standard of value. But, it deserves to be remarked, that an arbitrary reduction of the standard does not afford any real relief to the embarrassments of the governments by whom...\nit is practised. Their debts are, it is true, reduced in proportion to the reduction in the value of the currency, but their revenues are also reduced in the same proportion. A degraded piece of money <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for the same quantity of commodities. To whatever extent the standard of money may be reduced, prices must, very soon, be raised to the same extent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the degradation be 10 per cent., the government, as well as every one else, will, henceforth, be compelled to pay L.110 for those commodities which it might previously have obtained for L.100. To bring the same real value into the coffers of the treasury, it is necessary, therefore, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a> should be increased whenever the standard is diminished\u2014a measure always odious, and in some countries impracticable.\n\nBut a diminution of revenue is not the only bad effect which governments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> from reducing the standard of the currency. A state which has degraded its money, and cheated its creditors, is unable to borrow again on the same favourable terms as if it had acted with perfect good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. We cannot expect to enjoy the reputation of honesty, at the same time that we are openly pocketing the booty earned by duplicity and treachery. Those who lend money to knaves always stipulate for a proportionably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. They must not only obtain as much as they could have obtained from the most secure investments, but they must also obtain an additional rate or premium, sufficient to cover the risk they run in transacting with those who have given proofs of bad faith, and on whose promises no reliance can be placed. A degradation of the standard of value is, therefore, of all others, the most wretched resource of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKRUPT\">bankrupt</a> government. It will never, indeed, be resorted to, except by those who are alike unprincipled and ignorant. \"It occasions,\" says Dr Smith, \"a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of private people; enriching, in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the idle and profuse debtor at the expense of the frugal and industrious creditor; and transporting a great part of the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> which were likely to increase and improve it, to those which are likely to dissipate and destroy it. When it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself bankrupt, in the same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a fair, open, and avowed bankruptcy, is always the measure which is both least dishonourable to the debtor, and least hurtful to the creditor. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of a state is surely very poorly provided for, when, in order to cover the disgrace of a real bankruptcy, it has recourse to a juggling trick of this kind, so easily seen through, and at the same time so utterly pernicious.\"\u2014(Wealth of Nations, Vol. III. p.435.)\n\nSome of the bad consequences resulting from a change in the value of money might, indeed, be obviated, by enacting, that the stipulations in all precedent contracts should be made good, not according to the present value of money, but to its value at the time when they were entered into. This principle, which is conformable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> maxim of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>\u2014\"Favor monet\u00e6 considerandus atque inspicieundus est, a tempore contractus, non autem a tempore solutionis\"\u2014was acted upon, to a certain extent, at least, by the Kings of France, during the middle ages. Ordonnances of Philip le Bel, Philip of Valois, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VI., issued subsequently to their having increased the value of money, or, as the French historians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, returned from the foible to the forte monnoie, are still extant, in which it is ordered, that all previous debts and contracts should be settled by reference to the previous standard. But although the same reason existed, it does not appear that any such ordonnances were ever issued when the value of money was degraded. It is obvious, indeed, that no government could derive any advantage whatever from reducing the value of money, if it were to order, as it is in justice bound to do, that all existing contracts should be adjusted by the old standard. Such a measure would reduce the revenue without reducing the incumbrances of the state; while, by establishing a new standard of value, and unsettling all the notions of the public, it would open a door for the grossest abuses, and be productive of infinite confusion and disorder in the dealings of individuals.\n\nThe odium and positive disadvantage attending the degradation of the value of metallic money, appears to have at length induced almost all governments to abstain from it. But they have only renounced one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of playing at fast and loose with the property of their subjects, to adopt another and a still more pernicious one. The injustice which was formerly done by diminishing the quantity of bullion contained in the coins of different countries, is now perpetrated with greater ease, and to a still more ruinous extent, by the depreciation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> currency.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> period from 1601 to 1797, no change from 1601 was made in the standard of money in this country, to 1797, no change made in the Standard. A project for enfeebling the standard had indeed been entertained, both in 1626 and 1695; but, in the former instance, it was quashed by the celebrated speech addressed by Sir Robert Cotton to the Lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">Privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, and in the latter by the opposition of Mr Montague, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> of the Exchequer, in the House of Commons, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> made by the writings of Mr Locke, by whom the injustice of the scheme was admirably exposed, out of doors. It was reserved for Mr Pitt to set aside a standard which had been thus preserved inviolate for nearly two centuries. The Order in Council of the 25th February 1797, and the acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> by which it was followed up, effected a total change in our ancient monetary system; and, instead of the old standard, gave us the self-interest-\n\n---\n\n* In the sixth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Cours d'Economie Politique of M. Storch, there is a very instructive account of the paper money of the different continental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. We can confidently recommend it as containing a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of new and important information.\ned views and opinions of twenty-four irresponsible individuals. The circulation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">Bank</a> of England paper was secured, by its being exclusively issued in payment of the dividends, or of the interest of the public debt, and by its also being received as cash in all payments into the exchequer; but no attempt was made to sustain the value of this paper on a par with the value of gold or silver. Full power was given to the directors of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> to raise or depress the value of money, as their interest or caprice might suggest. They were enabled to exchange unlimited quantities of bits of engraved paper, of the intrinsic worth, perhaps, of 5s. a quire, for as many, or the value of as many, hundreds of thousands of pounds. And, in such circumstances, our only wonder is, not that paper money became depreciated, but that its value was not more reduced\u2014that a still greater quantity of bank-notes were not thrust into circulation.\n\nFor the first three or four years after the restriction, the Directors, ignorant, perhaps, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the immense power which had been placed in their hands, seem to have regulated their issues nearly on the same principles that they had regulated them by, while they were obliged to pay in coin. It appears, by the Tables of the Price of Bullion, published by order of the House of Commons, that, until 1801, bank-notes were on a par with gold. In 1801 and 1802, however, they were at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCOUNT\">discount</a> of from 3\u00bd to 7\u00bd per cent.; but they again recovered their value; and, from 1803 to 1809, both inclusive, they were only at a discount of L.2, 13s. 2d. per cent. But, in 1809 and 1810, the Directors appear to have totally lost sight of every principle by which their issues had previously been governed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> amount of bank-notes in circulation, which had never exceeded 17\u00bd millions, nor fallen short of 16\u00bd millions in any one year from 1802 to 1808, both inclusive, was, in 1809, raised to L.18,927,833; and, in 1810, to L.22,541,523. The issues of country bank paper were increased in a still greater proportion; and, as there was no corresponding increase in the business of the country, the discount on bank-notes rose from L.2, 13s. 2d. in 1809, to L.13, 9s. 6d. per cent. in 1810! The recommendation to return to cash payments, contained in the Report of the Bullion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a>, presented to the House of Commons in 1810, appears to have given a slight check to the issues of the Bank. All apprehensions from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> were, however, speedily dissipated; for, in May 1811, when guineas were notoriously bought at a premium, and bank-notes were at an open discount, as compared with gold bullion, of upwards of 10 per cent., the House of Commons not only refused to fix any certain period for reverting to cash payments, but actually voted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, declaring that the promissory notes of the Bank of England had hitherto been, and were at that time, held to be, in public estimation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the legal coin of the realm!\n\nThis ever memorable resolution\u2014a resolution which took for granted, that a part was equal to a whole\u2014that L.90 and L.100 were the same thing\u2014relieved the Bank from all uneasiness respecting the interference of Parliament, and stimulated the Directors to increase the number of their notes in circulation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that, in 1812, they were at an average discount of 20\u00bd; in 1813, of 23\u00bd; and, in 1814, of 25 per cent.! This was the maximum of depreciation. The importation of foreign corn, subsequent to the opening of the Dutch ports in 1814, by occasioning a great decline of the price of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> article of agricultural produce, produced an unprecedented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of distress, first among the farmers, and latterly among the country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKERS\">bankers</a>.\n\nIt is estimated that, in 1814, 1815, and 1816, no fewer than 240 private banking companies either became altogether bankrupt, or, at least, stopped payment; and the reduction that was thus occasioned in the quantity of bank-notes in circulation, raised their value cause of so rapidly, that, in October 1816, the discount was reduced to L.1, 8s. 7d. per cent. In 1817 and 1818, the average discount on bank paper, as compared with gold, did not exceed L.2, 13s. 2d. per cent. In the early part of 1819, it rose to about 6 per cent.; but it very soon declined; and, for the last two years, paper has been nearly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with gold. (See Table No. V. annexed to this article.)\n\nNothing that has ever happened in the history of the country has proved more injurious to its best interests than these fluctuations. From 1809 to 1815, the creditors of every antecedent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>, landholders whose estates had been let on lease, stockholders and annuitants of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>\u2014all, in short, who could not raise the nominal amount of their claims or of their incomes proportionally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the real value of money, were robbed of a corresponding portion of them. The injustice that would have been done to the creditors of the state and of individuals, who had made their loans in gold or paper equivalent to gold, by raising the denomination of the coin 25 per cent., however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and palpable, would not have been greater than was actually done them in 1814, by compelling them to receive payment of their just debts in paper depreciated to that extent. Circumstances which could neither be controlled by the Bank of England nor the Government, put an end, as we have just seen, to this monstrous system. But we are still suffering, and will long continue to suffer severely, for the folly and injustice of which we have been guilty. The mischief occasioned by the sudden reduction of the paper currency, and the consequent rapid augmentation of its value, has been still greater than what had previously been caused by its depreciation. The hardship occasioned by the subversion of private fortunes, and by the change in the debts and credits of individuals, might be, in both cases, nearly equal. A vast amount of public debt was, however, contracted during those years in which the depreciation was greatest; and the state is now paying this debt, borrowed when the bank-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> was not worth more than 14s. or 15s., with bank-notes whose value is increased to 20s. The salaries, too, of all our public officers, and the expenses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, and of all our other public establishments, had been generally augmented proportionably to the reduced value of money. And as no corresponding reduction has been made from the sums voted on their account since the currency recovered its value,\nit is easy to perceive, that a very great addition has thus been made to the public expenditure. All those taxes, too, which were imposed when the currency was depreciated, must now, though not nominally, be really increased in the same proportion; so that, when sufficient allowance has been made for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the value of money, it is doubtful whether the country be not more heavily burdened at this moment than it was in 1813 and 1814, though we have since got rid of the income-tax\u2014a tax which produced about 14 millions a year!\n\nSuch is but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> and imperfect outline of the very great and almost irreparable injury which the late fluctuations in the value of the currency have entailed on the country. And yet, strange to tell, there is a considerable party amongst us who, not satisfied with this pernicious transference of property from the pockets of those who ought to possess it, to the pockets of those who have no right to it whatever\u2014are clamouring for a fresh reduction of the standard! And it is, indeed, unquestionably true, as we have already had occasion to show, that after a currency has been for a considerable period depreciated, equal injustice is done by again raising its value, as was done by first depressing it. There is good reason, however, to doubt, whether the depreciation from 1809 to 1815 (for the depreciation of 2\u00bd per cent. during the seven preceding years is too inconsiderable to be taken into account) extended over a sufficiently lengthened period to have warranted the Legislature in departing from the old standard. But, without giving any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> on this point, which is confessedly one of considerable difficulty, it is sufficient to remark, that the value of the currency was raised, independently altogether of the interference of Government. The destruction of country bank paper, occasioned by the renewed intercourse with the continent, and the consequent introduction of cheap foreign corn, had raised the value of paper currency, in October 1816, to within 1\u00bd per cent. of par. Now, as the act 59th Geo. III. was not passed until 1819, and as the currency had not been depreciated in the interim, we frankly confess our inability to discover the grounds on which it is affirmed to have been the cause of that rise in the value of money which took place three years before it was in existence! The proceedings in 1819 did not really add 3 per cent.* to the value of bank paper, nor were they intended to raise it. Their great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was to shut the door against a new depreciation, and to prevent the value of paper, which had, for three years, been nearly on a level with gold, from being again degraded. By maintaining the old standard, or, which is the same thing, by maintaining the currency at a value nearly corresponding to that to which it had attained in 1816, 1817, and 1818, Parliament certainly gave permanence to the serious injury which the rise in the value of money had occasioned to the debtors in all the contracts entered into between 1810 and 1815; but if, instead of maintaining this old standard, they had raised the mint price of bullion to its market price in 1814, they would have done an equal injury to the far more numerous body of creditors, in all the contracts entered into previously to 1810, and in the three years subsequent to autumn 1816.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was impossible to adopt any measure capable of giving general satisfaction to those whose interests were so widely different; and against which many plausible, and even forcible objections, might not have been stated. We are firmly persuaded, however, that the Legislature followed that course which was, on the whole, the wisest and most advantageous. It must be remembered, that much of that inconvenience and distress, which must always result from every sudden rise in the value of money, had been got over in 1817 and 1818. The rents of such farms as had been let during the depreciation had been very generally reduced, a vast number of annuity bonds had been cancelled, and prices and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> had begun to accommodate themselves to the new scale of value. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of Mr Peel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> only gave stability to arrangements which had been brought about by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> course of events; and, by fixing the standard at its former limit, secured us, as long at least as we have good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and honesty to maintain it inviolate, against the risk of future derangement and fluctuation.\n\nBut, even if it could be shown that the act 59th Geo. III. was inexpedient at the time when it was passed, that would add but little real strength to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> of those who are now contending for its repeal. Every objection which it was possible to make to the degradation of the standard in 1819, must apply with tenfold force to the scheme for degrading it in 1821; while, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, all the arguments that could have been urged in favour of the measure at the former period must now be proportionably weakened. Two years more have been afforded for the completion of those arrangements which had been begun in 1817 and 1818; and an immense variety of new contracts and engagements have been entered into, exclusively with reference to the present value of money. A fresh reduction of the standard would vitiate all these engagements, and plunge us of new into that confusion and embarrassment from which we have now nearly escaped. We should again witness the most pernicious subversion of private fortunes. Debtors would be again enriched at the expense of their creditors; the ignorant and unwary would again become the prey of the cunning and the crafty; and capitalists would be eager to transfer their stock from a country where it would be impossible to lend it, except at the risk of getting it repaid in a depreciated currency. \"Whatever, therefore,\" to avail ourselves of the just and forcible expressions of Mr Harris, \"may be the fate of future times, and whatever the exigency of affairs may require, it is to be hoped that that most awkward, clandestine, and most direful method, of cancelling debts by debasing the standard of money, will be the last that shall be thought of.\"\u2014(On Money and Coins, Part II. p. 108.)\n\n* At the period when Mr Peel's bill was passed, bullion was at L. 4 an ounce; consequently, the depreciation was only L. 2, 13s. 2d. per cent.\nNo. I.

Some of the mountains, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-loaf, of 1850 feet, the Blorenege of 1720, and the Skyrid-vawr of 1498 feet, with some others, display their summits for many months covered with snow, whilst their sides, near the bottom, are cultivated with the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of grain, and terminate in meadows of the most luxuriant fertility. Mr Fox, in his Agricultural Survey of this county, divides it into three districts. The first, comprising the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, consists in part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tracts of moor or marsh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, exhibiting in some parts of it a great depth of unctuous loamy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and in others a vast body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> peaty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. In other parts of this district the soil is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> loamy consistence, highly favourable to the growth of various trees. Another portion is a mixture of clay and loam, forming fertile meadows, and above them an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> soil, in which turnips, potatoes, and grain, liberally repay the cultivator. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> division comprehends the eastern part of the county, extending to a considerable, but varying distance on both sides the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USK\">Usk</a>. The soil is of a faint red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, highly grateful, and being carefully cultivated, the whole displays the appearance of great fertility. The third division comprises the western and most mountainous parts of the county. The soil on the hills is generally of a thin peaty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, covering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, underneath which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of coal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> ore, of most unbounded productiveness. The low lands in this division are chiefly in the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> and pasture, whilst the middle lands are occupied partly by pasture and partly by arable husbandry.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of this county have been generally celebrated for the picturesque scenery which their banks display, and which, added to the many remains of antiquity that are to be seen near them, invite the visits of numerous parties in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months, and afford the highest gratification to travellers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. The most eminent of these rivers, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> as well as...\nutility, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WYE\">Wye</a>. It rises on the southern side of Plinlimmon, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTGOMERYSHIRE\">Montgomeryshire</a>, and forming the division line between the counties of Brecon and Radnor, passes through a part of Herefordshire, and enters this county at Dizon, becomes navigable for boats at Monmouth, and empties itself into the Severn at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEPSTOW\">Chepstow</a>. The beauties of this stream are derived from the sinuosities of its course, the uniformity of its breadth, the picturesque country through which it flows, and, among many other striking objects on its banks, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a> of Tintern, and the mansion and grounds of Piercefield. The tide in this river rises at Chepstow to a greater height than in any other English river; at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of that town the elevation has been between 50 and 60 feet, and it takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> with most unusual celerity. The Usk rises in the black mountains of Brecknockshire, and when it enters this county, passes between lofty hills, which gives its borders every variety of beauty that landscape can display. It is navigable for a short distance, and only for barges. It abounds with salmon, some of which are frequently caught in it of a most unusual size. The other rivers are the Rumney, the Monnow, and the Ebwy, each of which has peculiar and characteristic beauties.\n\nThe heavy productions of this county, iron, coal, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, have given rise to the establishment of various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> for their conveyance. The Monmouthshire canal begins at Newport, and dividing into two branches, connects that town, by one, with Pontypool and Pontnewydd, and by the other with Crumlin Bridge. The Brecknockshire canal unites with this, and passes, in its course, under a hill by means of a tunnel 360 feet. The county is most abundantly supplied with rail-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, leading from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> mining districts to the canals; and many private mines have small rail-ways, provincially called tram-roads, leading to the principal iron rail-roads, by which a facility is afforded to the conveyance of productions through a country whose roads are eminently bad.\n\nThe agricultural productions are wheat, barley, and oats, with a few peas and beans. They are sufficient for the supply of the inhabitants, and the small surplus, as well as much fruit, is sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>. On the arable lands the system of summer fallowing is pretty generally pursued. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> is lime, the stone from which it is burnt being most abundant. The oxen of this county are highly esteemed both for draught and for fattening. They are usually a deep red colour, short in the legs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> in the carcase, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> between the breeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a> and Glamorgan. They are very docile in harness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> fatten so as to weigh from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. They are much sought after by the English graziers, who purchase them when young, and after employing them in labour, fatten them for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>. The sheep are remarkably small, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> is short and coarse, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> is fine in the grain, and of a most delicate flavour. Of late years much improvement has been made in the flocks by judicious crosses with the Cotswold, Southdown, and Dorset sheep. The horses of the county are generally a very meagre, light, and uncompact breed. In this county and Brecknockshire the breeding and rearing of mules is carried to a greater extent than in any other part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. They are found very beneficial in the hilly districts, where the mines are worked. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">Male</a> asses are imported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and the south of France, to propagate, and the mules are frequently of a size and strength equal to the natives of those countries.\n\nThe landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of this county is in few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, but divided generally into small farms, varying in rent from \u00a370 to \u00a3200. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> are generally for 21 years, and the conduct of the landlords to their tenants is liberal, and somewhat parental. Many farms are held by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> roll.\n\nThe greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of Monmouthshire are derived from its mines. Coal and iron ore abound in all the hills. The facilities for interior conveyance have been before noticed. The coals of this county have, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> for constructing the canal, the peculiar privilege of being carried to the opposite shore, including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Bristol and the towns on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, as far as Bridgewater, without paying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-borne duty. This gives to them a monopoly of those large markets, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COLLIERIES\">collieries</a> in the forest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a>, and of Glamorgan and Carmarthenshire. The proprietors of these last mentioned mines have petitioned Parliament to be placed on a similar footing, but, after a most patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of all the circumstances in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a>, the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the coals brought by the Monmouthshire canal were confirmed. The iron mines were worked as early as the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, and made a rapid progress; but owing to the great consumption of wood, which soon caused a scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, they had sunk very low till about fifty years ago, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of making iron from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">coke</a> was introduced. This discovery, with the improvements in machinery, has given a vast impulse to the working the iron mines. Fifteen or sixteen works, on the largest scale, and many smaller ones, have been established. At one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the weekly delivery of pig-iron and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>-iron from these different works is stated to have amounted to a thousand tons.\n\nThe abundance of iron, and the facility of intercourse with Cornwall, have led to the establishment of some very extensive manufactories of tin plates. The manufactory of a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a> was first practised in England by Thomas Allgood of Pontypool, in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> the Second; and though the skill of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a> has been successfully exerted to rival the town from whence that ware derived its name, the business is still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> there, but upon a small scale. The manufactory of caps, for which Monmouth was celebrated at the period when Shakespeare wrote, has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> abandoned. At Newport and Chepstow there are some considerable establishments for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> ships.\n\nFew parts of the island contain more numerous or better preserved remains of Roman and Saxon antiquity than this county. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAERLEON\">Caerleon</a> was long the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of the British dominions, and the residence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>. The ruins of the wall, 530 yards by 480, are still to be traced; and the vast\nmasses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which are now in a confused state, show that it was formerly a place of great importance. There are many Roman encampments still visible. The remains of the abbeys of Gracedieu, Llantharn, Llanthony, and Tintern, and of the priories of Goldcliff, Thynemarke, Monmouth, and Usk, invite the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of antiquarians. The castles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABERGAVENNY\">Abergavenny</a>, Carleon, Caldecot, Castell-Glas, Chepstow, Dinham, Grosmont, Llanfair, Skenfrith, Striguil, Usk, and Llandeilo, are the most remarkable among numerous other similar buildings. The character of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> of the churches of Abergavenny, Carleon, Caldecot, Chepstow, Newport, and others, discovers a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> origin. The antiquities of Monmouthshire would, indeed, require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> for their delineation.\n\nThe county gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Abergavenny to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Neville, not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> or writ, but as possessors of the castle of that town. The Irish Marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORMOND\">Ormond</a> derives from it the title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a> is Baron Herbert of Chepstow and Rogland, and Baron Beaumont of Caldecot Castle. The members to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons are two for the county and one for the united boroughs of Monmouth, Newport, and Usk. The whole county is within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LLANDAFF\">Llandaff</a>, except three parishes, which are in St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>'s, and three others in that of Hereford. The English Judges, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> circuit, hold the assizes twice a year at Monmouth.\n\nThe county is divided into six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, and contains one hundred and twenty parishes and seven market towns. At the census of 1811, there were returned 12,127 houses, inhabited by 12,548 families. Of these families 5,815 were employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, 4,812 in trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and 1,916 in other occupations. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants was 62,127, viz. 30,987 males and 31,140 females. The baptisms of males, the preceding years, were 642, and of females 632. The burials of males were 514, of females 444. The marriages were 416. The towns which contain more than 1000 souls are as follows:\n\n| Town                  | Houses | Inhabitants |\n|-----------------------|--------|-------------|\n| Monmouth              | 675    | 3503        |\n| Abergavenny           | 575    | 2815        |\n| Uskawreod             | 416    | 2728        |\n| Chepstow              | 429    | 2581        |\n| Trevethin (including Pontypool) | 466 | 2423        |\n| Newport               | 445    | 2346        |\n| Aberystwyth           | 302    | 1562        |\n| Llanover              | 341    | 1572        |\n| Mamhole               | 218    | 1230        |\n| Machen                | 235    | 1167        |\n| Llanwenarth           | 241    | 1138        |\n| Mynydd-maen           | 194    | 1098        |\n| Pantegue              | 212    | 1052        |\n| Penmaen               | 205    | 1010        |\n\nThe seats of noblemen and gentlemen within the county are very numerous; the most remarkable are, Troyhouse, Duke of Beaufort; Bix Weir, General Rooke; Courtfield, William Vaughan, Esq.; Coldbrook, J.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Moray formerly included <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the shires of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a> and Banff, and that of Nairn, besides the present county; but the name is now confined to this district, which is also known by the appellation of Elginshire. It is situated between 57\u00b0 12' and 57\u00b0 43' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude, and between 3\u00b0 2' and 3\u00b0 58' west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, extending about 40 miles from north-east to south-west, and in breadth from 8 to 14 miles in the interior, but upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> from 17 to 23 miles; and it contains, including its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, 480 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, or 307,200 English acres, of which only about a third is productive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. The county of Moray has the Morayshire frith of that name on the north, Banffshire on the east, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-INVERNESS_SHIRE\">Inverness-shire</a> on the south, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAIRNSHIRE\">Nairnshire</a> on the west. The river Spey, which, with a few exceptions, separates it from Banffshire, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> considered its eastern boundary. On the south, it is intersected by a small part of Inverness-shire, by which two parishes, Abernethy and Duthil, partly in this county, are detached from the body of it. It is divided into fifteen entire parishes, and contains part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> parishes more, the rest of which are situated in the counties adjacent. The Presbyteries to which these parishes belong are, Aberlour, Abernethy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELGIN\">Elgin</a>, and Forres, all under the jurisdiction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of Moray.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> divisions are the low grounds which stretch along the coast, varying in breadth, southward, from 5 to 12 miles, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> which occupy the interior; yet the former is not without ridges of hills, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great height, which generally rise in a line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the shore; nor the latter without considerable tracts of low land, particularly on the branches of the Spey and Findhorn, and the other streams which flow from the south. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and productiveness of these two divisions are very different. The climate on the coast is supposed to be as good as that of any part of Scotland, both in respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and dryness; while the prevailing soil is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> loam, in many parts affording plentiful crops, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> early, and are seldom injured by bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> season. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from westerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> for almost three-fourths of the year. The strong gales are from the north-west, and the most frequent rains from this point and the north-north. Easterly winds, however, prevail in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> months, to the great injury of vegetation. The annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, on the northeast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, near Speymouth, is said to be little more than 25 inches; and the medium temperature of the year varies from 45\u00b0 to 50\u00b0. In the mountain district, the winters are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and severe; more rain falls than on the coast; and the labours of the harvest are sometimes not brought to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> till the crops are covered with snow. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a>, sandstone, and slate, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, abound in various parts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> was almost a century ago wrought in Strathspey by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> Buildings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Spey, the Lossie, and the Findhorn, which receive the waters of a great many mountain streams. The Spey, the most considerable, has a course of 30 miles before it enters Morayshire, at Aviemore, from which it flows in a deep channel, and with a considerable fall, till it empties itself, after describing a line of about 96 miles in all, into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> at Speymouth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>. It is not navigable, except near its mouth, and there only for small vessels; but it affords the means of bringing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the sea the forests on its banks; and the rents of its salmon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, some years ago, exceeded \u00a37,000 per annum. The Lossie flows almost parallel to the Spey, about ten miles distant, and, after a course of 24 miles, during which it works a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of corn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, falls into the sea at Lossiemouth, about six miles to the north of Elgin. The Findhorn, like the two former, flows from south to north, and enters the Frith of Moray at the village that bears its name, having\ntraversed Inverness-shire, where it has its source, Nairnshire, and this county, for a distance of 60 miles. There is also a valuable salmon fishery on this river. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> lakes, beginning on the east, are Loughnaboe, which covers about 60 acres; Lough Spynie, which formerly spread over more than 2000 acres, but has been since laid almost dry by drainage; Inchstellie, Lochloy, and Loughnadhur, containing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> on which there are the remains of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fortress, and where it is said turnips have been found growing naturally. Chalybeate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> are found in every quarter of the county, but none of them are in much repute.\n\nThe valued rent of Morayshire, in Scots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, is \u00a365,603, os. 5d., and the real rent, in 1811, of the lands was \u00a362,312, 9s. 6d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, and of the houses \u00a32,753, 14s. 6d. In the same year, the number of proprietors was forty-one, five of whom held more than half the valuation and rental; and that of the freeholders thirty-six. Only about a fortieth part is held in feu, the whole, with this exception, and small portions belonging to the burghs, being freehold, but nearly a third is under entail. Many of the proprietors have elegant mansions, of which the most considerable, beginning on the eastern quarter, are Innes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Fife; Findrossie, Leslie, Bart.; Gordonstown and Altyre; Cumming Gordon, Bart.; Duffus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a>, Bart.; Darnaway Castle, the Earl of Moray; Brodie House, Brodie; Grange, Peterkin; Burgie Castle, Dunbar Brodie; and Elchies House, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">Grant</a>.\n\nThe size of farms on the coast does not often exceed 400 acres, and the greater number are below 150 acres. The larger farms are generally held on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> for nineteen years, as in other parts of Scotland, but many of the smaller tenants have no leases. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the county produces all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of corn grown in Scotland, with turnips, potatoes, and clovers. In the higher district, barley and oats, with potatoes, are almost the only crops, with small portions of turnips and cultivated herbage, and in some places a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>. The native cattle have been improved, by crossing them with the West Highland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; and the sheep, which were originally similar to those of Shetland, have, in many parts, given way to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LINTON\">Linton</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-faced race, and a variety of other breeds from the south. On the small farms, especially in the mountain district, the horses are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a>, seldom more than nine or ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; but, upon the larger farms on the coast, they are not inferior to those of other parts of Scotland. In the latter situation, two only are used at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, and oxen are seldom worked; whereas, the team in the high grounds consists of oxen and horses intermixed, sometimes to the number of six or eight.\n\nMorayshire employs few of its people in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. A woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> has been established at Newmill, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of St Andrews Lhanbryd, and in the same quarter another for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> of cottons. There are tanneries at Forres and Elgin; and, at the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAWING\">tawing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of some consideration, which sends most of its produce to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The exports are cattle, corn, and salmon, with a variety of smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. The value of the salmon has been stated at about \u00a325,000, and that of all the other exports does not exceed \u00a330,000 yearly. A considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> is floated down the Spey, and shipped at Garmouth; but it is chiefly the produce of Strathspey, in Inverness-shire. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages are, Elgin, the county town, Forres, Garmouth, Urquhart, Lossiemouth, Bishopmill, Findhorn, Rothes, and Balnatom. The first two are burghs; Elgin is joined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, Banff, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERARY\">Inverary</a>, and Kintore; and Forres with Inverness, Nairn, and Fortrose, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of members for the Scottish burghs. Both these places are of great antiquity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> in 1800 and 1811 is exhibited in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>.

His parents were respectable inhabitants of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and conferred on him the best elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> that could be acquired in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>. His first instructions were received in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of San Fernando, in his native city, from whence he removed to the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVILLE\">Seville</a>. In both these seminaries he was distinguished, as well by his application and talents, as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> of his demeanour. He attended the classical and mathematical course as taught in the latter seminary, as well as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>; and during his residence there, sedulously applied himself to anatomy, medicine, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. The ardour he displayed for this class of pursuits was great, so that, when he removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a> in 1757, he had made such progress as to enable him to become a lecturer on anatomy. It was then usual for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of Madrid to select some promising young men, and send them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, to improve their faculties, and advance their knowledge of the sciences. Mutis was selected for this purpose, but about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Pedro Messia de la Cerda was appointed Viceroy of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANADA\">Granada</a>, and proposed to the ardent naturalist to accompany him, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of physician, to that interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. His natural modesty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of retirement induced him to relinquish the opportunity of visiting different countries, and thereby increasing his knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and to devote himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of those objects of natural history which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> presented, and which had previously been scarcely explored by any scientific European.\n\nHe embarked with the Viceroy, and landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a> in the year 1760. The various new productions that met his eye at every point in that hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, did not detain him from ascending towards the mountain plains, where at the city of Santa F\u00e9 de Bogota he fixed his abode.\n\nHe had scarcely reached the destined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his residence, before he began to arrange his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for the collection of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> to whose study he was attached, and of which the descriptions formed the delight of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and the basis of his future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. He soon began a correspondence with Linnaeus, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> during the life of that celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who procured his admission to the academy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>. His accuracy, diligence, and enthusiasm, were highly estimated by the Swedish botanist, who felt, in the eulogiums he paid him, that he very imperfectly gratified his own sentiments of respect and admiration.* His skill was speedily known through Europe by all the botanists of considerable eminence, as his discoveries were communicated to many of them, through the extensive correspondence which he maintained.\u2020\n\nAt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> Mutis arrived at Santa F\u00e9 de Bogota, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> was in profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of science, and, even in the university, the true system of the universe was so little known, that he is represented as having encountered great difficulties, when he first taught that the world turned on its own axis, revolving round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and was in reality only a planet of the solar system. With the approbation of the viceroy, he began to dispense mathematical, and especially astronomical knowledge, to the pupils in the college of the Rosario; and he had the satisfaction, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of a protracted life, to see a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of scholars formed on the principles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, in spite of the anxious and alarming fears of their parents, who, on its first introduction, considered it impious, or at least heretical.\n\nHe continued diligently exploring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a> for every vegetable production, during the intervals of instruction in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and continued both pursuits with unabated ardour. When his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> Cerda had finished the period of his Viceroyship, he proposed to Mutis to return with him to Spain, but he was so much fascinated with the solitude of the vast woods and extended plains, with the features of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> displayed on the boldest scale, and the deep azure of the unclouded sky, that he determined, under their favouring auspices, to spend the rest of his life in South America, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of vegetation, and of the starry world. His studies, instead of producing scepticism, strengthened his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and, under its influence, he entered into holy orders in 1772. From that period, he divided his time between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and the sciences, and, whilst in the former he was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, he displayed in the latter the qualities of a genuine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>.\n\nIt was a fortunate circumstance, both for the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, and for the fame of Mutis, that the Court of Madrid felt a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in the promotion of that study, and appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>-\n\n---\n\n* In memoriam Josephi Celestini Mutis, Americae summi Botanici, qui historiam plantarum Americanae, in primis Palmarum, pulcherrimam parat, et plurima nova hinc opuscula communicavit.

Linn.\n\n\u2020 Cavanilles, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, thus expresses himself: \"In honorem sapientissimi viri (J. C. Mutis) qui jure merito Botanicorum in America princeps salutatur, debetque etiam inter primates Europaeos colocari.\"\ners in each of its extensive dominions in America to investigate, arrange, describe, and draw their various productions. Mutis was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Botanical Board for the Viceroyalty of Santa F\u00e9, and commenced his operations by the project of that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> the *Flora of Bogota*, which only the munificence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> could enable him to undertake. In 1782, he selected the spot most favourable for executing this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, and, judging the central situation of Mariquita, at the foot of the mountains of Quindiu, to be the best adapted for his purpose, he removed thither, and resided in that place for the succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, in pursuance of his plan of study. The place was admirably chosen; for though at the foot of the Andes, it is on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, and in a temperate climate; and, being in the vicinity of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGDALENA\">Magdalena</a>, though considerably higher, it has the advantage of easy access to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of temperature, and to all the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of plants which the greatest possible differences of climate can produce. In this secluded town, he and his pupils were constantly employed in roaming in the extensive plains, penetrating the thickest woods, scaling the highest mountains, and at times encountering the severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the valleys, whilst collecting every rarity of the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. He there created a class of painters, who drew the plants as they were collected: he had a school of engraving, in which were executed some of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> plates, which have excited so much admiration among the botanists and artists of Europe. The state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, arising principally from the exertions he made, and the hardships he encountered in these pursuits, induced him to remove from Mariquita in 1772, and fix his residence again in the capital, to which he was also drawn by the desire of being nearer to a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of artists, than could be collected in the retired spot from whence his exploratory journeys had been directed. His labours in perfecting the *Flora* were continued with unabated industry till the end of his life, and after his decease the work was continued by some of his pupils; though it has received serious interruptions from the civil wars, in the course of which some of those appointed to continue it were cut off amidst the contests of the various revolutionary factions. Among these is particularly to be regretted Don Francisco Caldas, who was endeared to Mutis, and most nearly resembled him in his industry, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the study of natural history. Besides the great work, the *Flora*, Mutis finished one on the history of the trees of the quina <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and exercised his great acuteness in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the varieties of that family, whose bark has introduced a new era in the practice of medicine.\n\nAmidst his botanical labours, Mutis never neglected his astronomical observations and experiments. It had often been suggested by philosophers in Europe, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> had probably an influence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, similar to what it exercises on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>. The situation of Santa F\u00e9 was favourable for a variety of experiments, which Mutis conducted, and by which he ascertained the fact so clearly, as to remove all doubts on the subject. He was instrumental in obtaining powers from Madrid for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> on the summit of the Andes, at a far higher elevation than any of the observatories of Europe are placed. He had remarked, that the blue of the firmament appears darker in proportion to the elevation at which the observer stands, and that on the highest attainable situations, the sky seems almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; so that the stars shine with a brilliancy uninterrupted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, and even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, are visible without the help of glasses.\n\nHe deemed the position favourable for astronomical observations, and especially for those of the fixed stars; for being near the equator, it commanded a view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTELLATIONS\">constellations</a> both of the northern and southern hemispheres; and from its height, the observer is little liable to interruption from intervening clouds, or to errors from the inconstancy of the refractions. At his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> recommendation, and under his inspection, the observatory was begun in 1802, and finished in 1803. Some instruments were collected in the country, and others were ordered from Europe. The first were, as may be supposed, destitute of those improvements which have been more recently introduced; and it unfortunately happened, that some of those exported from Europe were lost on the passage. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> had not been completed when Mutis died, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> storms which have agitated that country have prevented the completion of the collection. The founder had, however, directed the course of observations to be prosecuted with as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> as the imperfection of the instruments would admit. Though the wise intentions of Mutis have been delayed, we may hope they have not been frustrated, but may look forward to a time when the catalogue of fixed stars in the southern hemisphere shall be considerably augmented, and their positions determined with the greatest accuracy. In the meantime, some astronomical and meteorological observations have been made and published, in a periodical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a>, and the exact latitude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> of the observatory has been determined. Its elevation above the level of the ocean, as determined by barometrical observations, frequently repeated, is 9416 feet. As this observatory is the first erected in South America, as it stands much higher than any other that ever was constructed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> its advantages shall be properly improved, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be a benefit to science, and a durable monument to the fame of its founder.\n\nMutis enjoyed good health through a long life, which was closed in a manner worthy of a philosopher and a Christian, without pain or struggle, 11th September 1808. He left various manuscript works on plants, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">meteorology</a>, and on mining; an herbarium of upwards of 20,000 plants, more than 5000 drawings of plants, and a large collection of woods, of shells, of minerals, and skins of animals. He had also a very extensive collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-paintings, of all the various animals of the viceroyalty coloured, in exact conformity to nature. It was the last wish he expressed, that his valuable collections might furnish the basis of a national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a>; but the turbulent season which commenced soon after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>,\nand the unsettled state in which public affairs have since continued, have hitherto prevented the fulfillment of his wishes.

The inhabitants are in general Hindoos; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> having been so often the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of warfare, it is not nearly so populous as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, and some other of the British provinces. It produces horses, cattle, sheep, and swine, but none of them of a good size. This province is divided into three districts, named Fata-na, Nagara, and Chatrakal: each district is managed by an Amildar, who is an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, and revenue, and who is accountable for his conduct to the ministers of the Rajah, who are kept to their duty by the presence of the British resident.\n\nAs this province is now particularly connected with the British interests, and, from a rival state, is become one of our staunchest allies, it is requisite to enter at some length into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. The ancestor of the reigning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> is said to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of a band of herdsmen, who emigrated with their flocks and cattle from the province of Gujarat, and were allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in Mysore. The first person of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> who distinguished himself was named Vijeya, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of bravery. He married the heiress of the Wadiar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> chief of the town of Caroogully and its dependencies, and succeeded his father-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. His immediate successors are not known; but, in the year 1507, Cham Raj took possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, but still acknowledging himself as a subject of the Maha Rajah of Annagoondy, who was a descendant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Hindoo monarchs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIJANAGUR\">Bijanagur</a>. Tim Raj succeeded in 1548, and annexed some other districts to his government. Heere Cham Raj ruled from 1571 to 1576, and was succeeded by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> Raj Wadeyar, who appears to have taken advantage of the declining power of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> paramount, not only to annex to his own estates those of the Rajah of Chickraipatam, but to take possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> and fortress of Seringapatam. This event occurred in the year 1610, and may be considered as the era of their sovereignty. After this event, he subdued several of the neighbouring Wadeyars, and kept them in confinement at Seringapatam. He died in the year 1617, and was succeeded by his grandson Cham Raj, who added considerably to the Mysore territories, and died in 1637. He was succeeded by a posthumous son of the former Rajah, named Immadee Raj, who, in the course of a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, was poisoned by his prime minister. Canty Revy Narsa Raj, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> cousin of the deceased, was the next sovereign of Mysore. He made various conquests, and reigned till 1659. He was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> who established a mint, and coined the fanams and pagodas, still current, which go by his name. Dud Deo Raj was his successor; he made several conquests, and died in 1672. Chick Deo Raj mounted the throne in 1672, and died in 1704. This prince completed the subjugation of the turbulent landholders, made a number of prudent regulations which still exist; and, among other accessions, acquired by purchase the town and fortress of Bangalore. He also sent an embassy to the Mogul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> Aurungzebe, who conferred on him a splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, and granted him permission to sit on an ivory throne, which is still in existence, and was used on the late installation. Canty Raj, son of the last sovereign, mounted the throne in 1704. Having been born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAF_AND_DUMB\">deaf and dumb</a>, he was called the Dumb Rajah. It was in this reign that the great influence of the Dulwoy, or prime minister, commenced, which ever after rendered the Rajah a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAGEANT\">pageant</a>. After a nominal reign of ten years, the Dumb Rajah died, and was succeeded by Dud Kishen Raj, who left the management of affairs entirely to his ministers, and died, after an inglorious reign, in the year 1731. He was succeeded by Cham Raj, who, not having been found of a sufficiently pliable disposition, was deposed and imprisoned by his ministers, in the year 1734. On this event, the Mysore ministers deviated from the regular line of succession, and chose a boy of five years old, of another branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family, named Chick Kishen Raj, to be the pageant of their government. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of public business was at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> distributed in the offices of, 1st, Dulwoy, or commander-in-chief; 2dly, Serv Adikar, or comptroller of the revenue; and, 3dly, Purdhan, or privy counsellor. The first of these offices was held by Deo Raj, the second by Nunjeraje; but they subsequently exchanged appointments, and the influence of the latter was much increased by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> to the young Rajah, in the year 1746. It was under the command of Nunjeraje Dulwoy, that a large Mysorean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> marched to the assistance of the British, and their ally the Nabob Mohammed Aly, in the year 1758; but as the promised bribe, held out for his assistance (the cession of the fortress of Trichinopoly), was not complied with, he shortly after became their enemy, and for nearly two years laid siege to Trichinopoly; but, in the end, was compelled to abandon it, in consequence of the invasion of Mysore by an army of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAHRATTAS\">Mahrattas</a>. From this period may be dated the decline of the minister's power, the downfall of the Hindoo dynasty, and the succession of a Mahometan usurper, whose history being not generally known, it is deemed requisite to insert an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of it here.\n\nThe great-grandfather and grandfather of Hyder\nAly were both named Mohammed; they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> persons, who emigrated from the Punjab, and settled in the vicinity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Geeso Deraz, the famous saint of Kalbergia. The son of the younger Mohammed was named Futteh Aly, who, having entered the army as a private soldier, rose by degrees to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of commander of a regiment, with the title of Naick. This person improved his fortune by marriage, but was killed in an engagement about the year 1729. Some time previous to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he had raised a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a> over his father and his wife, in the vicinity of the town of Colar, and was buried there. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> in which Futteh Aly was killed, his family were taken prisoners, and plundered of every thing they possessed. The widow, accompanied by her two sons, Shabaz-Saheb and Hyder, boys, took refuge with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Ibrahim, who commanded a small body of peons or infantry, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the governor of Bangalore. When the elder brother Shabaz had attained a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, his uncle procured for him a recommendation to an officer of rank in Seringapatam; and he was received into the service as a subordinate officer of infantry, in which situation he distinguished himself, and gradually rose to the command of 200 cavalry and 1000 infantry. It is probable, that Hyder profited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> of his brother, and was employed by him in a subordinate situation; but he does not appear to have distinguished himself till the year 1749, when, during the siege of Deonhally, by his intrepidity and zeal, he attracted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Dulwoy Nunjeraje; and, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, was promoted to the command of it, with a garrison of 200 infantry and 50 cavalry. Permission was also granted him to augment the number of troops, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he found it requisite. During the contest between the Nizam Nasir Jung, and his rival Muzaffir Jung, in the year 1750, Hyder Aly commanded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the quota of Mysore troops, and distinguished himself in resisting the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>; but as soon as Nasir Jung was killed, he employed his followers in plundering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> of his late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>; and, amongst a number of other valuables, carried off two camels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, 300 horses, and 500 stand of arms, all of which he conveyed safely to Deonhally.\n\nHyder Aly was again employed at the siege of Trichinopoly; and during the battle of the 17th of August 1754, between the British and the French armies, with their allies on both sides, Hyder seeing the baggage of the British left without protection, ordered some of his troops to amuse the Tanjorine cavalry in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, whilst he with another body galloped round, and fell upon the rear of the convoy, amongst which he created great confusion, and seized 35 carts laden with ammunition and stores. On the retreat of the Mysoreans in 1755, Hyder was detached in the command of an army, consisting of 5000 infantry, 2500 cavalry, six guns, and a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> troops, to secure the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DINDIGUL\">Dindigul</a>. During the three years he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the government of Dindigul, he very considerably increased the number of his troops, disciplined his battalions, and took into his service several French artificers, under whose superintendence he formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>, arsenal, &c.\n\nIn the year 1758, a serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a> having broken out amongst the troops at Seringapatam, Hyder Aly was ordered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> thither with all his regular corps. Partly by fair means, and partly by force, he succeeded in quelling the mutiny, and in disbanding the army; in reward for which service, he was gratified with the fortress and adjoining district of Bangalore, as a fief or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> estate. In the following year, Hyder was invested with the command of all the troops employed against the Mahrattas, and was at the same time authorized to conclude a peace with them; but as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> could not be obtained without a large sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and the government could not advance above half the amount, he was directed to borrow the remainder from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKERS\">bankers</a>; and in order to effect this, certain districts were assigned to him, to be held in pledge till the bankers should be reimbursed. Having appointed his own collectors to the districts, he borrowed the money, satisfied the Mahrattas, and returned in triumph to Seringapatam. His reception by the Dulwoy and young rajah was most gracious; by the former he was distinguished by the epithet of son, and by the latter honoured with the title of Behauder (the champion), which he ever after retained. In this sketch of the history of Hyder Aly, it is impossible to describe the various intrigues by which he subverted the authority of the Dulwoy (minister), and got the rajah completely into his own power. But his overweening confidence had nearly ruined him. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of May 1760, Hyder Aly was induced, by the intrigues of the French, to detach to their assistance almost the whole of the regular army then at Seringapatam; whilst he continued to reside in a garden a short distance from the city, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of only 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and a battalion of infantry. The rajah and his mother, a woman of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, weary of the tyranny of their oppressor, entered into a secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with a Mahratta chief, who was encamped on the frontiers, and who agreed to send, on an appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, 6000 chosen horse to their assistance; but owing to the procrastination of the Mahrattas, and an ill-timed attack from the foot on the cantonment of Hyder, he effected his escape with his hundred cavalry, attended by some camels laden with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, and succeeded in reaching the fortress of Bangalore, which was garrisoned by his own troops. This event took place on the 13th of August 1760. Immediately on Hyder's entering Bangalore, he sent off an express to recall the army from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNATIC\">Carnatic</a>, under the command of his brother-in-law Mukhdum Sahib; and dispatched orders to the various detachments of his troops, dispersed over the country, to join him without loss of time. By degrees he was joined by his detachments, by new levies, by the Carnatic army, and by what was of great consequence, 200 French European cavalry, and 100 infantry, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. With these forces, aided by intrigue, he defeated the Mysore troops in several engagements, and in the month of May 1761, again got possession of the person of the rajah. Hyder Aly, although now possessing all the real power of a sovereign, was still desirous of legalising his usurpation; he\ntherefore, by means of presents or concessions, received from the Nizam of the Dekhan a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of the seminary of Mysore, with a patent constituting him a Heft Hazary, commander of 7000 horse in the imperial service, and the title of Nabob Hyder Aly Khan Behaudev.\n\nIn the year 1763, he conquered the countries of Bednoor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOONDA\">Soonda</a>, and Canara; and in the three succeeding years, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALICUT\">Calicut</a>, and the greater part of Malabar. In 1766, the rajah Chick Kishen Deo died. When this circumstance was reported to Hyder, who was then at Coimbatore, he ordered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNERAL_RITES\">funeral <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> to be performed with all the usual ceremonies, and directed that the eldest son of the deceased, named Nunje Raj, should be placed on the throne, with the same parade and pomp as had formerly been used for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. Nunje Raj died, or was murdered, after a nominal reign of five years, and was succeeded by his younger brother Cham or Syama Raj, who, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> or policy of Hyder, was installed in the same manner as his predecessor.\n\nIn 1767, the Mahrattas and the Nizam, aided by a British auxiliary force, entered into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> against Hyder Aly. They in consequence invaded Mysore, and after having taken several of the fortresses, advanced towards Seringapatam. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>, Hyder ordered all the forage to be destroyed, and took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> on the banks of the river Cavery, in an entrenched camp. After some days skirmishing, Hyder contrived, by his wonderful skill in politics, not only to make peace with the Mahrattas, but to conclude an alliance with the Nizam against the British. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this treaty, the allied forces invaded the Carnatic in September; and on the 26th of that month a general engagement took place in the vicinity of Erroar. The British gained the victory, by which the Nizam, being intimidated, was glad to make peace, leaving his ally to extricate himself in the best manner he could. Hyder, much mortified by this event, commenced a regular retreat to his own country, and was pursued by the British forces under General Smith. When both armies had advanced nearly to Seringapatam, Hyder leaving his infantry and artillery to continue the retreat, wheeled off with all his cavalry, turned the rear of the British army, re-entered the Carnatic, and in a few days was at the walls of Madras. By this manoeuvre, he so intimidated the Madras government, that they were glad to make peace with him. The terms of the treaty were short and simple. All prisoners and places taken during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> were to be restored, freedom of trade was stipulated, and an offensive and defensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> concluded.\n\nIn the year 1771, Mysore was invaded by a powerful army of Mahrattas, who, after defeating Hyder, advanced to, and blockaded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>; but fortune again favoured him, by the indisposition and death of the young Peishwa, by which event dissension was sown amongst the Mahratta chiefs, and enabled Hyder to bribe them to retreat. The years 1773, 1774, 1775, and 1776, were devoted to the disciplining of his army, and to the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of his territories to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and west. This he was enabled to do by the dissensions of the Mahratta chiefs and the Nair princes.\n\nIn 1777, Cham, or Syama, the young Mysore Rajah, died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. Upon this occasion, Hyder ordered eight or ten boys, lineally related to the royal family, to be brought before him, and made choice of one of them, nearly in the same manner that Ulysses discovered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a>. This boy, whose name was also Cham or Syama Raj, was the father of the present Rajah.\n\nBy the treaty made with Hyder in 1769, the British had agreed to assist him against all his enemies; but when called upon to act against the Mahrattas in 1771, they had declined, and from that period Hyder harboured the most bitter hatred against them. The year 1779, when the British had quarrelled with the Mahrattas, and given offence to the Nizam, seemed a favourable opportunity of satiating his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>; he therefore, by means of his emissaries, concluded an alliance with the above mentioned powers, and invited every other sovereign in Hindostan to join the confederacy, and to make a simultaneous attack on the British territories in their respective vicinities. In conformity with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, Hyder Aly entered the Carnatic in the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1780, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of an army consisting of 30,000 cavalry, and 40,000 infantry, with a numerous train of artillery, aided by a corps of Europeans, and a number of French officers. Hyder commanded in person the centre or main body. The left wing was under the orders of his son Tippoo Sahib, and was destined to attack the northern Circars; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> wing, under one of his most esteemed generals, penetrated into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADURA\">Madura</a> and the southern districts. During Hyder's former invasion of the Carnatic, in 1767, he had caused his army to refrain from atrocities, and to treat the prisoners with gentleness; but on this occasion he boasted, \"that he was the engine of God's wrath, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the people of the Carnatic.\" His army was, therefore, guilty of the greatest cruelties, laying waste the whole of the country with fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>; not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> who were taken prisoners, but the peaceable inhabitants of the villages, were driven off like flocks of sheep to Mysore. The boys were made Mahometans, and the girls disposed of as slaves.\n\nNotwithstanding Hyder was frequently defeated by the British forces under Sir Eyre Coote, his numerous cavalry and well equipped artillery enabled him to overrun the country at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> part of it in the possession of his enemies, except Madras, and some other fortresses. This system of warfare continued till the death of Hyder, which took place in the city of Arcot, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 7th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1782, at the age of 64 years. At the period of Hyder's decease, his dominions, exclusive of his conquests in the Carnatic, comprehended nearly 80,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles; his territorial revenue amounted to two millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. Although his army consisted of 150,000 men, his treasure contained several millions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a> and specie.\n\nTippoo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a>, the eldest son of Hyder, having joined the army on the 2d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1783, quietly\nsucceeded to the empire of his father. A feeble attempt had been made in favour of the second son, called Abd al Kereem, now a state prisoner in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, but was considered of so little consequence, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> never attempted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of his brother, who either was, or pretended to be deranged, and always wore the dress of a fakir, or hermit.\n\nThe invasion of the western or Malabar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> by the British, and the capture of Bedenoor, compelled Tippoo to relinquish the views of his father on the Carnatic, and to proceed with all expedition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of his own territory. He left Arcot early in March; and having, in the course of the month of April, reached Bedenoor, he compelled General Matthews to capitulate. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the capitulation were, that the garrison were to pile their arms on the glacis, but to retain all their private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>; they were then to be marched, by the shortest route, to the sea side, and thence to be embarked for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>. But Tippoo, under pretence that the public treasure had been made away with, caused all the prisoners to be plundered. They were afterwards fettered, and then dispatched to different fortresses, where most of them died through hard treatment; the general and several of the principal officers were beheaded.\n\nAfter this event Tippoo marched to the seaport of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANGALORE\">Mangalore</a>, but was baffled in the siege of that place, till, in consequence of the peace between England and France, the French auxiliaries having declined any further co-operation with him, and the recent successes of the British in other parts of the country, compelled him to make peace. On the 11th of March 1784, a treaty was concluded between Tippoo and the British, the principal articles of which were, that all the places taken by either party during the war were to be restored, and that all the prisoners on both sides were to be released.\n\nTippoo being now at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, employed the remainder of 1784 in the complete subjugation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NAIRS\">Nairs</a> of Malabar, and the conquest of the Coorg country. Having thus vanquished or made peace with his enemies, he returned in triumph to Seringapatam; when, feeling himself perfectly established, and his authority acknowledged, both by his subjects and the neighbouring powers, he ostentatiously mounted the throne, and assumed the title of Sultan, thereby throwing off all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to or dependence on the Rajah of Mysore or the Emperor of Hindostan; for although the name Sultan may have been given him at his birth, it certainly was never used as a title during his father's lifetime.\n\nDuring the years 1785, 1786, and 1787, Tippoo was engaged in hostilities against the Mahrattas and the Nizam, in which victories were gained and defeats sustained by both parties; but the general result was in favour of the Sultan. The year 1788 was occupied by Tippoo in reforming the province of Malabar, and the forcible conversion of the inhabitants to the Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. In the following year he invaded the territories of the Rajah of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVANCORE\">Travancore</a>, who being one of the British allies, applied to them for assistance, which circumstance brought on the subsequent war, at the conclusion of which, in March 1792, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Cornwallis, at the head of the allied forces, compelled Tippoo Sultan to pay the sum of four millions of money, and to relinquish the half of his dominions.\n\nIn the year 1796, the Mysore Rajah Cham Raj died, leaving an only son, then two or three years old, to inherit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his ancestors; but the haughty Sultan would not condescend to acknowledge even a nominal superior; and so far from exalting the boy to the throne of his forefathers, he barely allowed him to exist, in squalid poverty and humiliating contempt. From this period till the year 1799, Tippoo was engaged in constant intrigues with the French, and all the powers of Hindostan, in order to raise a confederacy against the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. His correspondence was detected by the Governor-general, Lord Mornington, now Marquis Wellesley. War was determined on; the British forces, with their allies, under the command of General Harris, marched to Seringapatam, and on the 4th of May 1799 put an end to the empire and life of Tippoo Sultan.\n\nIt would have been no less unjust than impolitic for the British either to have taken possession of the whole of the conquered territory for themselves, or to have restored the family of Tippoo to power. It was therefore determined to place on the throne Krishna Odiaver, the son of the last Rajah, a boy of five years old; to put him in possession of the ancient capital of Mysore, with a territory surrounding it equal to that possessed by any of his ancestors, and yielding a revenue of L 1,030,000 sterling, with the entire management of the country by his own officers; but subject to the general superintendence of a British resident.\n\nOn the 30th day of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1799 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of installing the young Rajah took place, in a temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> erected for the purpose in the old fortress of Mysore. It was attended by the British Commander-in-chief, by many of the principal officers of the allied forces, and by an innumerable multitude of Hindoos, who testified their most unfeigned delight on beholding a person of their own religion, the orphan of a much injured family, restored to the possessions of his ancestors. Previous to the installation pensions had been granted to most of Tippoo's officers, and the family of the Sultan were sent as state prisoners to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VELLORE\">Vellore</a>, whence they were subsequently removed to Calcutta, where they now reside upon liberal allowances, and enjoy a degree of freedom much greater than would have been their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>, had these events not taken place.\u2014(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Gazetteer, or Geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>, Vol. IV.

Order.\n\n**Sepiacea.**\n\nDestitute of a multilocular shell.\n\nThe sac is strengthened by horny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> testaceous plates, unless where the habits of the animal render such support unnecessary.\n\n1. **<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> surrounded with Eight Arms and Two Feet.**\n\nThe two feet are nearly similar in their structure to the arms, or tentacula, but considerably larger in their dimensions. They have their organ on the ventral side of the mouth, between that organ and the funnel. The suckers are pedunculated, with their margin strengthened by a corneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. The sac is furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>-like expansions, and strengthened internally by corneous or testaceous ribs or plates. The head is divided from the sac on all sides by a neck. The margin of the anus is surrounded with tentacula.\n\nGenus, *Sepia.*\u2014The sac is furnished on each side throughout its whole length with a narrow fin.\n\nThe suckers are irregularly scattered on the arms and feet. The back is strengthened by a complicated calcareous plate, lodged in a peculiar cavity. This plate has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> known in the shop of the apothecary, under the name *Cuttle-fish bone,* and belongs to the species termed *S. officinalis.*\n\nGenus, *Loligo.*\u2014Calamary. Sides of the sac only furnished partially with fins.\n\nThe suckers are disposed on the arms and feet in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> row. The dorsal plate is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> and corneous, imbedded in the substance of the sac, and is multiplied with years. The *Sepia loligo* of Lin. is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of the genus.\n\nDr Leach has described three new species of the genus Loligo, which were collected by Mr Cranch during the voyage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>, in the unfortunate expedition under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Tuckey. These species belong to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> which have the suckers produced into hooked processes. In two of these species, *L. leptura* and *Smithii,* the suckers on the arms, as well as the feet, are produced into hooks; while, in one species, *L. Bankii,* the feet only are armed with hooks.\n\nThe same distinguished naturalist has instituted a new genus nearly allied to Loligo, from two species collected during the same voyage. The following characters are assigned to it:\n\n\"Genus, *Cranchia.*\u2014Body oval, sack-shaped; fins approximating, their extremities free; neck with a frenum behind, connecting it with the sack, and with two other frens, connecting it with the sack before.\n\n\"Sp. 1. *Cranchia scabra.*\u2014Sack rough, with hard rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>.\n\n\"Sp. 2. *Cranchia maculata.*\u2014Sack smooth, beautifully mottled with distant ovate spots.\"\n\n**Head surrounded with Eight Arms without Feet.**\n\nThe suckers have soft margins. The sac is destitute of fin-like expansions, and is either simple or strengthened in the interior by two short corneous processes. The head is united with the sac behind, without the intervention of a neck.\n\nArms all equal in Size.\n\nGenus, *Octopus.*\u2014Suckers arranged in a double row.\n\nThe suckers are sessile. The oviduct is double. The margin of the anus is simple. The *Sepia octopodia* of Lin. is the type of the genus.\n\nGenus, *Eledona.*\u2014Suckers on the arms disposed in a single row.\n\nM. Lamarck has figured and described two species of this genus, in the Mem. de la Soc. d'Hist. Nat. One of these is a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and is remarkable for giving out an odour like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>.\n\nArms Unequal.\n\nGenus, *Ocythoe.*\u2014Two of the arms at their inner extremities furnished with membranaceous expansions.\n\nIn this genus, which was instituted by M. Rafflesque, the suckers are in a double row, and supported on footstalks. In the specimens of the *Ocythoe Cranchii,* procured during the expedition to the Congo, Dr Leach observed \"four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> spots on the inside of the tube, resembling the surfaces for the secretion of mucus, two inferior and lateral, and two superior, larger, and meeting anteriorly. On the rim of the sac, immediately above the branchiae, on each side, is a small, short, fleshy tubercle, which fits into an excavation on the opposite side of the sac.\" Phil. Trans. 1817.\n\nThis animal was long considered as the fabricator of the shell termed Argonauta or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">Paper</a> Nautilus. The observations, however, of Mr Cranch, the Zoologist to the Congo Expedition, have demonstrated that the shell is merely the temporary residence of this animal, which it quits at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. \"On the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>,\" says Dr Leach, \"he placed two living specimens in a vessel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; the animals very soon protruded their arms, and swam on and below the surface, having all the actions of the common *Polypus* (octopus) of our seas; by means of their suckers, they adhered firmly to any substance with which they came in contact, and when sticking to the sides...\"\nof the basin, the shell might easily be withdrawn from the animal. They had the power of completely withdrawing within the shell, and of leaving it entirely. One individual quitted its shell, and lived several hours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> about, and showing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inclination to return into it; and others left the shells as he was taking them up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>. They changed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, like other animals of the Class Cephalopoda; when at rest the colour was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-coloured, more or less speckled with purplish; the under parts of the arms were bluish-grey; the suckers whitish.\"\n\nThe specimens which furnished an opportunity for making the preceding observations were met with in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, and afterwards on the voyage, swimming in a small argonauta, on the surface of the sea.

In the dioceses of Cloyne and Rossalme, there are 316 parochial schools, attended during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> by 21,892 scholars. It may, indeed, be affirmed, generally, that, in point of literary attainments, the peasantry are greatly above the same class of men in England. (Newenham.) Yet it is strictly true, that the Irish are ignorant in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>. The solution of this seeming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> is to be found in the poverty of the people, the absurd books which are put into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> instruction.\n\nThe poverty of the people is so great, that after they have learned to read, they are in general unable to purchase any book, or they are bred up in employments where reading is difficult by reason of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> labour in which they are engaged. (Wakefield, II. 398-9.) In fact, it is impossible that knowledge can make any great progress in a country where the poverty of the people is so extreme, and where they are content with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> support of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In such circumstances, they necessarily want both the means and the inclination to turn their education to any good account. The books which are put into the hands of the children, so far from being such as are calculated to train them to habits either of order, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, or self-restraint, are precisely the reverse; being legends of saints, or histories of thieves, smugglers, and prostitutes, calculated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the youth of both sexes into every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of violence and depravity! It has, accordingly, been often observed, that the lower Irish, though educated, are utterly deficient in moral and religious knowledge (Survey of Cork, 714; Wakefield, II. 404); and to this circumstance much of the violence and cruelty which prevails among them is to be ascribed.\n\nVarious other circumstances have combined to multiply to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> the facilities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, and to expand, in this country, beyond almost any other, the means of subsistence.\n\nThe first is the extraordinary fertility of the country, and the small expense at which cultivation can be conducted. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> contains 20,487,000 English acres, and of these above 13,000,000 are actually under tillage. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> does not require any expensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of culture; on the contrary, it is in general so rich, that it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> yield an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> crop of wheat and potatoes for ever; and can be taken into cultivation at a very small expense. But for this circumstance, the poverty of the Irish cottars, and the almost total want of agricultural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, would have operated as a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to a numerous population.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is the introduction of the Potatoes and its singular adaptation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of Ireland. That this root furnishes food to the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> is universally known; but its effects in expanding the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subsistence are not sufficiently considered. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> is 82 barrels per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> weighing 20 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. This amounts to 22,960 pounds, which, divided by four to bring it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> nourishment of wheat, will be 5740 pounds. The average produce of an Irish acre of wheat is four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, which, at 460 pounds to the quarter, is 1840 pounds, not one-third of the solid nourishment yielded by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of potatoes. (Young, II. 120.) Mr Newenham considers three pounds of potatoes as equal to one of wheat; at this rate, the acre will yield four times as much nourishment under the potatoe, as when cropped with wheat.\n\nPotatoes have been introduced into every kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> as well as Ireland, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other have they become the staple food of the poor. It is the condition and habits of the people, as they are determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> institutions, and other causes, which fixes the standard of comfort and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> at which they marry. The introduction of the potatoe, by expanding the means of subsistence, removes to a greater distance the ultimate check which the inability of raising an increase of food must impose upon the multiplication of mankind; but taken by itself, it has no tendency to make the population advance faster than their comfort requires. It facilitates the multiplication of mankind, and increases the rapidity with which population advances; but, unless the people are predisposed, from other causes, to press upon the means of subsistence, it has no tendency to augment their redundancy. Under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and political institutions of the Irish, the population of the country would have been equally redundant, though much smaller than it now is, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had lived on oats or wheaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. The introduction of the potatoe may be the cause why the population is now six in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of three millions: but it is not the cause why, during the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of this increase, the numbers of the people have been greater than, under existing circumstances, could be comfortably maintained. (1. i. 1.)\nThe first knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a>, it is not improbable, was derived from the discovery of a meteoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of this metal. Such mass, existing in a state of considerable purity, and capable of being hammered into form, may have exposed the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of those valuable properties which have been applied with so much ingenuity and labour to the advancement of human affairs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">Tradition</a> says that the discovery of iron took place in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the accidental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of a wood. This is certainly a possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, where there might happen to exist on the surface masses of iron ore, a circumstance not very uncommon. Perhaps it is a more probable conjecture to suppose that the discovery may have taken place, and been brought to a comparative state of perfection, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of converting wood into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> purposes. If the sylvan carboniser happened to pursue his art in a forest, occupying the surface of the mountain lime, abounding with ores of iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to that formation, the casual introduction of masses of the ore in mixture with the covering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the fire would be unavoidable. In a fortunate moment, and under a happy conjuncture of circumstances, a lump might penetrate the ignited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>,\u2014a strong current of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> might have arisen while the woodman slept,\u2014an unusual temperature might thus have been excited,\u2014and (though injurious to the result of his labours) iron might in this way have obtained its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> existence. Supposing a partial knowledge of its properties to have been derived from the meteoric mass, this would lead to its immediate application to similar purposes. The success of the experiment would, of course, depend upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the product,\u2014similarity of surface or polish, would, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, most likely be the only properties in common to both,\u2014uniform malleability, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> under the hammer, could only result from a regularly constructed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, governed by long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and certain established rules of process.\n\nUntil the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of bellows, the Air-bloomery seems the only mode by which iron could have been obtained. To say what was the first form or shape of this furnace is impossible. Such furnaces have long since ceased to exist in this country, and it is only by the remains of scoria, in elevated situations, that their former existence may be inferred. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a> represents the air-bloomery of the Africans as a low conical structure, containing, within very narrow limits, the aperture for admitting the air, and passing off the ignited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>. Air-bloomeries are still in use in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and on the shores of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, where the ores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBA\">Elba</a> are worked to considerable extent.\n\nThe rationale of this process is the deoxydation of the ore, by means of the contact of heated charcoal. To produce a beneficial result, it is necessary to use ores rich in iron, and united with as small a dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> as possible. The ores are stratified, and covered with charcoal, which is from time to time replaced as it becomes wasted by the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>. The ores during the lower degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and period of deoxydation, are sheltered as much as possible from contact with the air. When the metallic particles are developed, an increased temperature is then necessary to unite the masses, and then exposure to air facilitates the process of welding. Lumps of the coalesced ore, impregnated with its earthy parts, and a portion of the iron in the state of scoria, are then taken from the furnace, and hammered into a rough bar called a bloom. This is subsequently reheated and drawn into ploughshares, or other implements which may be wanted.\n\nAs the facility of the air-bloomery would depend in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> upon a steady and uniform current of air, seasons would occur, and even insulated periods of the same operation, wherein the process would either not proceed at all, or with languor. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> temperature was necessary to complete, by a union of masses, the result of the previous deoxydation, a falling off in the current of air would not only retard but destroy the economy of the process. Under such circumstances, during summer, or in hot climates, the invention of bellows would be hailed as a powerful auxiliary to the air-bloomery. Their application, at first, would most probably be confined to that part of the operation necessary to produce the welding temperature, but experience and observation would soon lead to higher and more important advantages, which, in the end, though they must have been the result of infinite labour and perseverance, amply compensated for the additional expense of a bellows blower.\n\nThe era of the Blast-bloomery must indeed have been the commencement of an important revolution in the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRON_MAKING\">iron-making</a>. This will be better understood by contrasting the principles in the two operations respectively. In the Air-bloomery, the ore was, by means of the charcoal in contact deprived of its oxygen, and, as an inevitable consequence, aided by the increased temperature, passed into the state of soft or ductile iron. In the Blast-bloomery, not only was the ore deprived of its oxygen, but, by the higher and more uniform temperature occasioned by the use of bellows, a union took place between the iron of the ore and the charcoal of the fuel. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> would immediately produce fusibility; and crude, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-iron, or an imperfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, would first make its appearance in the early stages of the blast-bloomery. The soft and ductile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of iron, which resulted from the air-bloomery, would no longer appear, but become\nmixed with a new and crude species of the metal, incapable of being hammered, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to the more perfect product a deleterious quality,\u2014the bellows would, in many instances, be laid aside, and their usefulness in the process denied, or at least doubted. Chance would discover to some smith, more intelligent than others, that, by frequent attempts in forging, the new metal was improved; he would soon observe, or discover, that this additional process might be considerably abridged, by directing the nose of the bellows upon the metallic regulus, before it was, in the first instance, removed from the furnace. Thus a new form of furnace would be suggested, having for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> the complete fusion of the ores, and the separation of the iron from them in a fluid state. Hence eventually resulted the blast-bloomery, in its most perfect and expeditious form, making in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> as much iron as an air-bloomery could in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and in a manner more economical, whether the measured result in metal from the ores or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of labour are considered.\n\nThe blast-bloomery of this country is still recollected by some very old men. Its form was either circular or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, its height from three to four feet. Previous to blowing, it was nearly filled with charcoal, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of ore, over which was thrown a larger charge of charcoal. The blast was urged by means of bellows variously constructed. The ores were thus rapidly heated, and deoxygenated in the upper part of the furnace. As the ore descended and approached the blast, a portion of the fuel, by the increased temperature, united with the ore,\u2014fusion ensued, and nearly the whole metallic contents were precipitated on the bottom of the furnace. The nose of the bellows was then inclined, and directed upon the surface of the molten mass,\u2014combustion and a copious scorfication ensued, which was removed from the furnace by repeated tapping. This operation was continued, and hastened by frequent stirring, till the remaining iron had, by an effectual decarbonization, passed into the state of soft or malleable iron. It was then broken into convenient masses, carried to the hammer, and formed, as in the bloomery, into blooms. In a more advanced and enlightened period the defects of the air-bloomery are many and striking. The cementation necessary to deoxygenate the ore, previous to fusion, must have been, from the smallness of the furnace, partial and imperfect, and acquired at an immense sacrifice of fuel. The process was not, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> blast-furnace, continuous; each charge, composed of a certain measure of charcoal and ore, was smelted, separated, and worked, before the furnace was filled for a renewed operation. When the charge of fuel happened to be in excess, which would sometimes be the case, the iron would imbibe an extra <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of carbon, and be proportionally fusible; this would demand a prolonged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the blast on the surface of the iron, and thus consume time in an unprofitable waste of the metal. The imperfection of the process may be pretty correctly estimated from the variety of slags, and the quantity of iron they contain. The Roman and Danes' cinders now found, and which were the current production of the blast-bloomery in remote ages, contain from 25 to 55 per cent. of iron, and have, in the last three hundred years, been extensively in use as ores, for the production of iron, in the blast-furnace.\n\nTo the blast-bloomery, in the art of iron-making, succeeded a larger furnace, which is now known by the name of the Blast-furnace, and from the discovery of which, the Foundery and Forge, including the Finery, must have resulted. The vast advantages of this furnace arise from the continued action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>, a complete separation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of all, or nearly all, the iron originally in the ore,\u2014a greatly increased quantity in a given time,\u2014and a lessened consumption of fuel in the manufacture. Unlike the imperfect reguli of the bloomery, the metal of the new furnace was fluid, could be collected and remain so for many hours in the bottom of the furnace, and then be run into channels formed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>,\u2014but in this state, from the extra dose of carbon, it did not possess any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> fitting it for the hammer, or for rendering it capable of being formed into a bloom, without subsequent operation. The effect produced in the blast-bloomery, by directing the bellows upon the surface of the separated iron, most likely suggested the idea of a separate furnace, in which a similar operation might be performed, without any connection with the previous smelting. The latent but unerring operations of chemical causes, accidentally associated with a larger furnace, and the favourable proportions of ore to fuel, would produce a fluid metal, which, along with the scoria flowing unexpectedly from the furnace, might thus first exhibit iron under a new form of existence. This would directly lead to experiments in the bloomery, with a view to obtain uniform and regular results. In time it would be found out, that adding to the height and capacity of the furnace increased the fusibility of the iron, and produced it of sufficient fluidity to run from the furnace. This fact once ascertained, would open a new field of observation and experiment, and the dimensions of the furnace would only be limited by the sparing quantity of air, or blast, afforded by the imperfect bellows of the day. For a time this would be partially remedied by the use of a suspending medium in the furnace, since called boshers, but, in the end, the advantages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> furnace would lead to an improved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of bellows. The foot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> blast bellows would give way to others moved by greater animal power, and these in their turn yield to larger bellows moved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-wheel. The power of a dozen bloomeries would be now concentrated in the new furnace,\u2014convenience and locality to ore and fuel would be sacrificed to moving power, only to be obtained by the concurrence of water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>.\n\nIn tracing the art through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of ages (during which no memorial of facts has been preserved relative to the progress of iron-making), it seems evident, that its first general establishment, under the system of bloomeries, must have been on elevated situations, for the purpose of obtaining a powerful current of air. After the invention of bellows and the blast-bloomery, the art must have been carried into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>,\u2014every village and township where ore and\nwood abounded would have its furnaces and smiths. The completion of the blast-furnace would once more remove the site of the manufacture, and the powerful blast of the new bellows, and the sturdy blows of the forge hammer, would, in the valley, supersede the more languid operations on the plain.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the period of the introduction of the blast-furnace into this country. Even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a> Forest, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> iron-making district, there exist no facts to show when it was there introduced, nor does tradition in any way assist us in the difficulty. In a publication of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a>'s in the reign of James I., the blast-furnace and other improved branches of the iron trade are there spoken of as having been extensive, \"but now falling into decay, owing to the scarcity of wood.\" The art of the founder seems, too, at this period, to have been extensively practised, and judging from specimens still in preservation, considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and skill in carving and relief must have been practised by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> makers of that period; and we know the fact of England's exporting, in the early part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>'s reign, a considerable quantity of such heavy ordnance as was then in demand. The civil commotions, excited by the long and disastrous contentions of the houses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, were most unfavourable to the introduction or improvement of the arts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. It is more than probable, the use of the blast-furnace was first known in the time of Henry VII. Whether it was a native or an imported discovery does not now appear. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, the sites of the first class of blast-furnaces are found to have been placed on small streams near their source. The supply of water for moving the bellows was, of course, confined to the winter months, and, according to the copiousness or permanency of the stream, the furnace would be kept blowing four, six, or eight months. In an age when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of labour was little understood and less practised, the disadvantages of this partial supply was not so great as they at first sight appear. The summer months were employed in procuring a supply of charcoal and ore for the winter consumption, and the same class of labourers passed from the furnace to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, or to the woods, and practised with equal facility their various callings.\n\nFrom the period above alluded to, up to the present time, the only improvement to be traced in the charcoal blast-furnace is the increased size, and corresponding increased power of the blowing-machine. By the removal of the establishment from a solitary stream to a greater depth in the valley, where a larger portion of the drainage of the district had united, giving greater power and permanency of supply to the water-wheel, the weekly produce in iron has been increased from 10 to 25 and 30 tons; and a furnace, under the improved system, has been kept in blast for three years together. In the plates which accompany this article will be found drawings of furnaces used in the time of James and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I., and in our own time. The former are proportioned from the hearth of one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s furnaces, lately discovered in Dean Forest, and which furnace has not been at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> since the commencement of the Civil Wars.\n\nAlthough in tracing the progress of iron-making from the bloomery to the blast-furnace, it is seen, that, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the great object to be obtained was soft or malleable iron, yet we see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of improvement, as if resting in the completion of a furnace, for the purpose of making an entirely new species of iron, possessing (except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>) no properties in common with the tough iron of the bloomeries. But in this, as in every department of manufactures and the arts, the division of labour and of process have proved the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to excellence. The division of iron-making, by whomsoever invented, into two distinct processes, must, at the time, have been marked by great and permanent effects. The manufacture of crude iron in the blast-furnace, and its subsequent malleabilization in the refinery, being operations not at all connected with each other, could be let alone, or carried forward, as best suited the views of the iron-maker. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> might smelt, and another purchase his iron and refine it. In place of obtaining from the bloomery one-fourth and one-third of malleable iron from the ore, the blast-furnace revived and returned, in a manner strikingly perfect, the whole iron of the ore, though in a state of crudeness or brittleness: though this was afterwards subjected to a loss of 25 per cent. in passing through the refinery, still, on the whole, it may be properly estimated, that, by the invention of the blast-furnace and the refinery, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the quantity of iron, from the same weight of ores, was brought to market. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the scoria of the bloomery and the blast-furnace would be so striking and manifest, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> would be succeeded by experiment. When the former were found to yield an abundant supply of iron by being smelted in the blast-furnace, a new species of property was created in the country. The spoil of the iron manufactures, from the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> downward, became at once, and for centuries, mines for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> supply of the blast-furnace. Extensive proprietorships of Roman cinders (as they were called) were formed. Forests, covered with decayed oaks, were uprooted, and plains that had slept for ages under a great depth of soil, were unbarred to pour forth their newly created treasures. In Dean Forest, it is computed, that nearly twenty furnaces, for a period of upwards of 300 years, were supplied chiefly with the bloomery cinders as a substitute for iron ore. These were used in the proportion of five-eighths of the whole charge, the remainder being made up of the calcareous ores from the mines of the mountain lime, and a portion of lean argillaceous and siliceous ironstones, accompanying the coal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>.\n\nDudley says, that in his time there were in England 300 furnaces for the manufacture of pig-iron; that each had forty weeks supply of fuel, and made, while at work, fifteen tons weekly, making in all the incredible total of 180,000 tons annually; and this, too, at a time when he represents the trade as in a decaying state, from the failure of the supply of wood. Either his statement must have been un-\nthinkingly exaggerated, or a great falling off in the manufacture must have taken place in the next hundred years; for we have it on good authority, that some time before pit-coal became the fuel of the blast-furnace, about the year 1740, the following quantities were respectively made in the English and Welsh iron-making counties:\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">County</a>     | Furnaces | Tons   |\n|------------|----------|--------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BRECON\">Brecon</a>     | 2        | 600    |\n| Glamorgan  | 2        | 400    |\n| Carmarthen | 1        | 100    |\n| Cheshire   | 3        | 1,700  |\n| Denbigh    | 2        | 550    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>      | 4        | 800    |\n| Gloster    | 6        | 2,850  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>   | 3        | 1,350  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>  | 1        | 200    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>       | 4        | 400    |\n| Monmouth   | 2        | 900    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTTINGHAM\">Nottingham</a> | 1        | 200    |\n| Salop      | 6        | 2,000  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORD\">Stafford</a>   | 2        | 1,000  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>  | 2        | 700    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUSSEX\">Sussex</a>     | 10       | 1,400  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a>    | 2        | 700    |\n| York       | 6        | 1,400  |\n\nTotal: 59 furnaces, 17,350 tons\n\nAnnual average quantity for each furnace: 294 tons cwt. qrs.\n\nWeekly average quantity for each furnace: 5 tons 13 cwt. 0 qrs.\n\nHitherto we have only spoken of the manufacture of iron in this country, as connected with the charcoal of wood as the basis of its operations. The gradually increasing population of the country had converted to other purposes a great portion of these woodlands that had formerly supplied fuel for the furnaces, and a period had arrived, when either a substitute must be found, or the manufacture of iron cease to be one of the staples of the kingdom. From Dudley, we learn, that James I. had granted many patents in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> parts of the kingdom for the manufacture of iron with pit-coal; that the attempts had uniformly failed, except in his own case, in 1619, when he succeeded to the extent of three tons weekly. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, applying in 1663 to Charles II. for another patent for the same object, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that he had succeeded at one time in making to the extent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> tons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">coke</a> pig-iron weekly. But it was not till about the year 1750 that pit-coal became a general and profitable substitute for charcoal of wood in the blast-furnace. Subsequent experience shows the cause of this tardy advancement to have arisen from the want of a sufficiently powerful blowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>. The introduction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine, and the consequent increase of iron now made, soon pointed out the deficiency under which all former experiments had been made with pit-coal. The incombustibility of coke, compared with charcoal, requires a more copious and powerful discharge of air, in order that it may perform profitably the functions of smelting and carbonating the metal. As soon as this was made evident, it not only stimulated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> to erect appropriate blowing apparatus for his coke pig furnace, but it led to an immediate improvement in the blowing machinery of the charcoal furnaces, still supplied with wood, so that, in 1788, about forty years after the collation of the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, we find the state of the charcoal pig-iron manufacture to be as follows:\n\n| County     | Furnaces | Tons   |\n|------------|----------|--------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a> | 4 | 650    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MONMOUTHSHIRE\">Monmouthshire</a> | 3 | 700    |\n| Glamorganshire | 3 | 600    |\n| Carmarthenshire | 1 | 400    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERIONETHSHIRE\">Merionethshire</a> | 1 | 400    |\n| Salop        | 3 | 600    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>   | 1 | 300    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>    | 1 | 600    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a> | 1 | 400    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>   | 1 | 300    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>   | 3 | 700    |\n| Sussex       | 2 | 150    |\n\nTotal: 24 furnaces, making 13,100 tons\n\nAnnual average produce from each furnace: 545 tons cwt. qrs.\n\nDo. of the former period (1740): 294 tons cwt. qrs.\n\nAnnual increased produce in favour of the improved period: 251 tons cwt. qrs.\n\nAverage weekly quantity produced in 1788: 10 tons 9 cwt. 3 qrs.\n\nDo. in former period, 1740: 5 tons 13 cwt. 0 qrs.\n\nWeekly increase in favour of the improvement: 4 tons 16 cwt. 3 qrs.\n\nBut, during the same period, it is evident, that an annual diminution of the manufacture of charcoal pig-iron was experienced to the extent of 4,250 tons, attributable to the decrease of wood, and consequently the use of coke pig-iron as a substitute. This deficiency was, however, amply compensated by the rapid increase of the manufacture of coke pig, as proved by the following statements:\n\nCoke Pig Furnaces in England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, in 1788.\n\n| County     | Furnaces | Tons each | Total |\n|------------|----------|-----------|-------|\n| Salop      | 21       | 1100      | 23,100|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a> | 6 | 750      | 4,500 |\n| Cheshire   | 1        | 600       | 600   |\n| Derbyshire | 7        | 600       | 4,200 |\n| Yorkshire  | 6        | 750       | 4,500 |\n| Cumberland | 1        | 700       | 700   |\n| Glamorganshire | 6 | 1100     | 6,600 |\n| Breconshire | 2        | 800       | 1,600 |\n| Stafford, about to blow | 3 | 800     | 2,400 |\n\nTotal: 53 furnaces, 48,200 tons\nBrought forward,\n\n| Tons. cwt. | Tons. |\n|-----------|------|\n| Average annual produce, | 907 0 |\n| Do. weekly do. | 17 9 |\n| Annual manufacture, at the same period, of charcoal iron, | - |\n| In the year 1788, there were erected, and blowing in Scotland, the following furnaces: | 13,100 |\n\nFurnaces.

Nor did the trade, at this period, become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>. Its unexampled increase and prosperity attracted the curiosity of the minister of the day; and it was reserved for a popular administration to fail in a financial speculation, which, if carried, was to cripple one of the main-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of national prosperity. In 1806, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> was brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, having for its object a tax of L.2 a ton on all pig-iron made, and of placing the manufacture itself under the supervision of the excise. The bill itself was an anomaly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, and, though armed with powers and clauses in abundance, could not possibly have been acted upon. It was framed in utter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> or details of the manufacture, and contributed much by its absurdity to the failure of the cause it was intended to support. The union necessary to oppose the bill with effect produced a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of facts, regarding the extent and progress of the iron trade in the kingdom, showing at that time its annual amount of product to be at least 250,000 tons. Since that period, the manufacture has gone on increasing; and, though subject to great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> in 1815 and 1816, has, during the last three years, resumed its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>. The manufacture of pig-iron, in Wales only, may be computed at, tons per annum, 150,000 Shropshire and Staffordshire, 180,000 Yorkshire and Derbyshire, 50,000 Scotland and other places, 20,000\n\nTons, 400,000\n\nHaving thus narrated the progress and increase of the manufacture of pig-iron, we shall next describe, as concisely as possible, the economy and order of the process itself, both in the charcoal and coke blast-furnace, as at this time practised. Plate LXXXIX. fig. 1. represents a charcoal-furnace of the largest dimensions, blown by three iron cylinders, moved by a water wheel, and so constructed as to be blown at either side, or at the back through openings called twyers. The furnace is filled with charcoal, which is gradually ignited to the top, when a charge of ore is put in, with a proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>, along with a certain number of baskets of charcoal. The furnace is from time to time opened below, and large bars of iron are introduced to serve as a temporary grate, through which the air may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> to the whole body of materials in the furnace. By the time the ore reaches the bottom, a considerable temperature has been excited, indicated by occasional fusions and scintillations. These are the general signals for introducing the blast. The furnace is shut up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> by means of a stone called the damstone, and space is left between this and the frontstone or tymp, which is filled with sand. The twyer is then opened and the blast introduced. Entire fusion commences. In a few hours the earthy matter of the ores accumulate in the state of glass, and are allowed to flow out at the opening in front, between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a> and tymp-stone. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the iron, by its superior weight, falls to the bottom,\nwhere it is allowed to collect for twelve or eighteen hours. The furnace is then tapped in an opening left on one side of the dam-stone, and the metal flows along a channel made in sand, called the sow, into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> prepared for it in the pig-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. The charge introduced from time to time as the smelting and reduction take place, is called the burden, and this burden varies considerably, and at different works materially, owing to the quality and richness of the ore. For many years past charcoal iron has been made chiefly with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hematitic ore of Lancashire, the uniform quality and richness of this \"mine\" rendering the operation of smelting a matter of greater certainty. Four large baskets, containing about ten bushels of charcoal, will smelt and carbonate the iron contained in four hundred weight of ore. With the necessary proportion of an argillaceous ironstone flux, this quantity will yield 24 hundred weight of iron. In the neighbourhood of Dean Forest, the calcareous ores of that district have been superseded by the use of Lancashire ore, except as a flux, for which purpose a lean carbonate of iron, much mixed with a sparry carbonate of lime, containing about 20 per cent. of iron, is used in the proportion of one-sixth to one-eighth of the ore. A charcoal furnace will consume from twenty-five to thirty thousand sacks in a year, each containing eleven to twelve bushels charcoal, the produce of at least one hundred and twenty acres of woodland. If the wood replaces itself fully in twenty years, then twenty-four hundred acres of land would be necessary to keep such a furnace at work.\u2014Coke to manufacture the same quantity of iron is obtained from less than half an acre of the Staffordshire main coal.\n\nThe preparation of the coke blast-furnace is similar to that practised with the charcoal blast-furnace, but its workings and burdens are infinitely more varied and complex than that of the latter, which, from the uniform quality of wood charcoal and Lancashire ore, experience has reduced to a certainty in every possible change and proportion arising from burden. In the coke furnace the case is widely different;\u2014every new situation has, in the nature of the coal, and the quality of the ore, something <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> and characteristic. The argillaceous ironstones generally used, are not very various in point of richness; few when roasted are under 35 per cent., and equally few exceed 45 per cent., and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> generally unite silex, lime, and clay. As it is the convenient practice at most works to mix lean and rich ores together, so as to reach a common standard of 40 per cent., there can be no material difference occasioned by the quantity of the iron used in the ore, the average produce of which may be correctly taken all over the kingdom at 37\u00bd per cent. It was long considered a fair burden if the coke carried, that is to say, smelted and carbonated the iron contained in an equal weight of the ore.\u2014This is now materially exceeded in Wales and in Staffordshire. At Blanavon, in the former, the coke smelts double its weight of ores, and in that principality generally, it smelts 50 per cent. more ore than its own weight. The same thing takes place in Staffordshire and in Shropshire; but at some furnaces in Derbyshire and in Yorkshire, the coke does not smelt above two-thirds its weight of ore. Again, some coals in coking yield 65 to 70 per cent., while others yield not more than 35. Hence a ton of iron is made at some furnaces under three tons of coal, and at others eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> tons are required for the same purpose. This great variety in the fuel renders general rules of little or no avail; a few simple principles, however, arising out of observation and experience, are understood and practised at all iron works.\n\nThe ironstones of this country, were they fused under the most favourable circumstances as to coke and blast, would not, without a mixture of lime or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, afford a perfect result,\u2014the glass or scoria, from the excess of silex, would be languid and tough, the iron would separate imperfectly, and its quality be injured by combination with silicon, in the absence of lime. The latter having a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> for silex than for iron, readily unites with the former, and leaves the iron to the full action of the carbon, and, like all mixtures, forms a more fusible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> than either separately. This mixture of the earthy matter of the ores is called cinder, scoria, or slag. In flowing it indicates, by its degree of heat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and fluidity, with the most accurate precision, the quality of the iron accumulating in the furnace. Lime, however essential to a proper flow of cinder from the furnace, is not primarily the cause of change in the quality of the iron,\u2014coke is the powerful vital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>,\u2014on its properly apportioned quantity and its quality the whole result depends. In vain will it be to harmonise in quality and proportion the other materials, if the proper quantity of cokes be not present to reduce the charge into a proper state of division, and to carbonate the iron to such an extent as to pass the blast without oxidation. When the due proportion of lime and coke are present in the charge, the cinder flows from the furnace, sometimes transparent, opaque, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, glassy, variously mixed with fine tints of blue, and nearly free from oxyde of iron. The metal accompanying such a cinder is what is called carbonated, or grey pig-iron. If a portion of the coke is withdrawn from the charge which gave out such results, the cinder instantly changes to a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, or entirely black colour,\u2014the iron parts with its carbon, becomes white in the fracture, deteriorated in the quality, and the whole operations of the furnace become disordered.\n\nHaving thus traced the general progress of the iron trade in Britain, commencing in a period of conjecture, and from beginnings the most limited and rude, to a Bar-Iron state of most unexampled prosperity and national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, during which the object of the iron-maker had changed from the production of malleable iron, in the first process, to that of crude iron, it is now necessary to retrace our steps, and pursue the subject as connected with the manufacture of malleable iron, or, as it is now called, bar iron. The advantages produced by the inflection of the bellows pipe in the blast-bloomery, as has already been noticed, most likely furnished the first idea of the refinery furnace, or the discovery might have been purely\naccidental. A piece of cast iron, by some unforeseen, but possible circumstance, formed in and tapped from the bloomery, would, by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, arouse curiosity and conjecture; and although, by simple heating, it would not yield to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the hammer, yet, by a second fusion in a common smithy fire, new properties would be developed, and in the end, ductile iron would be obtained. It is likely that, for a long time, these occasional runnings from the bloomery would be considered as a species of waste, and from time to time worked up by the common smith, while the bloomery performed its more extensive functions. As the smith became more perfect in his art and manipulations, iron produced in this way would be possessed of superior strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCTILITY\">ductility</a>, and would eventually obtain a preference in price and demand in the market. Thus a powerful inducement would be held out to the Bloomery proprietor, to increase, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> experiment, the quantity of cast iron, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> a method by which it could be regularly made; nor would the manufacturer stop short till a furnace was constructed, continuous in its operations, and regular in its results, as to the production of cast or pig-iron. From that moment the refinery became a furnace of the utmost importance to the iron trade. The process here performed was bold and philosophical\u2014nothing short of subjecting the most refractory of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> to a violent combustion could free it from an admixture which, but for this, must have remained a perpetual bar to its ductility. The open cavity of the furnace being filled with charcoal, a fire, by means of the bellows pipe, more or less inclined, was soon created; the cast iron of the furnace was placed upon the burning fuel; in time it melted, and, dropping in detail, passed before the current of air issuing from the bellows, and, deprived of its carbon, sunk under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the nose-pipe, having lost its fluidity, and become sufficiently coalesced. Iron bars were then introduced; the clotted iron, broken into pieces, and brought a second or a third time up above the level of the blast, till a sufficient refinement had taken place to enable it to stand the blows of the forge hammer. In this operation of refinement, or burning out the carbon, the iron entered into a complete state of combustion, and a considerable portion of it was converted into scoria. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, management, and quantity of this scoria were matters essential to be understood, and properly practised, both as to the quality of the iron and the economy of the process.\n\nThe quantity of iron wasted in this operation depended upon the quality of the cast iron made use of. If the iron was highly carbonated, an extra tendency to fusibility existed; and a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of exposure to the blast was necessary, to render the iron tough and ductile. From 25 to 35 per cent. of the whole iron introduced was, by this process, converted into a glass of iron, containing from 45 to 50 per cent. The operation in itself, compared with after events, was simple and expeditious, and the quality of the iron good. It is by a similar process that the superior qualities of iron brought from Russia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> are at this day manufactured; and the same mode is in general practice all over the Continent of Europe. In this country, the use of the finery continued as the only means by which iron could be profitably rendered malleable, until some time after the introduction of pit coal in its manufacture. When coke was first made use of in the blast-furnace, charcoal was still used in the common refinery, for the decarbonization of the iron to be made into bar iron; but it was found necessary to add another process to overcome the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a> in the quality of the coke pig-iron. The lumps formed in the refinery were afterwards heated, and drawn out into blooms, and these again into bars, according to the quality of the iron wanted. As charcoal became scarce, the manufacturer ventured to add, in the refinery, a small portion of coke along with the charcoal, endeavouring, in the after part of the manipulations, to overcome the consequent deterioration of quality; but, as charcoal was at last entirely abandoned, and coke exclusively used, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> took place in the process. In place of forming the product of the refinery into lumps, which exposed very little surface when afterwards re-heated, the masses from the refinery were carried and put under a heavy hammer, of four or five tons weight, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> out into a ragged sort of plate, called stamp iron; these were again broke, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> force, into small pieces, and their qualities examined. Those pieces, little removed from the nature of pig-iron, were called raw, and thrown aside to be refined. The perfect plates were built into piles of 50 to 70 lbs. weight; and each pile was placed upon a tile stone, or fire clay plate, or incased in a large rough sort of crucible, called a balling furnace pot. When a sufficient number of these were in readiness, a batch was introduced into a large furnace, heated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of pit-coal. When the temperature had been sufficiently raised to weld the parts together, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> or pile was removed from the furnace in succession, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of tongs, carried to the hammer, and formed into a bloom, being a short thick bar of iron. These blooms were re-heated in a fire, called the chaffery, and put under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> hammer, where they were drawn into their destined shape.\n\nA considerable waste of iron was in these various processes sustained, amounting to ten or twelve hundred weight for every ton of bars that were finished; but the difference of the price of fuel compensated for this additional loss; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the case, from the diminution of wood, and increased demand, had become imperious. The manufacture of bar iron remained subject to the stamping process many years, and the quality of the iron so made was strong, and generally tough; but the tardy finish of the hammer, and the arrangement of the whole, was not calculated speedily to overcome quantity; and it was considered a respectable establishment that could turn out, in one week, twenty tons of bars fit for the market. Refineries could not be multiplied without an additional increase of blast; and this, in general, could not be done without additional steam-engines; and, in short, the manufacture had become apparently stationary, when the genius of Mr Cort furnished the ardent minds of his countrymen with a new and interesting field for enterprise. When Mr\nCort laid before the public his new plans, so inadequate was this country to the supply of its own demands, that it imported from Russia and Sweden the enormous quantity of 70,000 tons of bar-iron annually. The object of Mr Cort's processes was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> into malleable iron, cast or pig-iron, by means of the flame of pit-coal in a common air furnace; and to form the result into bars by the use of rollers in place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HAMMERS\">hammers</a>. He made many experiments, and expended large sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, in the progress of establishing his inventions; but, so long as the various qualities of pig-iron only were the subject of operation, the results in the puddling furnace (his invention) were uncertain, attended with waste, and unequal in quality. These obstacles were at last removed by the operations of the coke-refinery, already alluded to. In refining grey or fusible iron, it was in common practice to tap the fusion, immediately upon its being smelted, into a flat-box. This plate of iron being so far refined, was again thrown up on the fire, and passed a second time before the blast. If still too fine to come into \"nature\" it was again put on the fire, to complete its decarbonization. Some of these plates being taken to the puddling furnace, were observed, in working, to possess properties, both as to facility and quality, very superior to the best pig-iron. It then occurred that the finery ought to be employed, not as formerly, to refine the iron to the extent of malleabilization, but merely to decarbonize it to a certain extent, and to fit it more properly for the operation of puddling. This gave rise to the very extensive practice of \"running out,\" which gives complete certainty to the puddling process. In this new refinery, or \"running out fire,\" the various qualities of pig-iron are, by the skill of the workman, mixed and reduced to a common standard, which is now called finer's metal. By this means, the operations of the puddler are rendered certain, and he can reckon, within a few minutes, the continuation of his operation. In the commencement of this, as in all new things, much difficulty and waste of iron was sustained, and only a limited quantity overcome. The loss now, when the refinement is carried on in one fire to the extent of sixty to eighty tons a-week, is estimated not to exceed 2\u00bd cwt. per ton, or 12 per cent.\n\nThe puddling furnace, for which the refined metal is thus prepared, is, in its general form and appearance, not unlike a founder's air furnace. It is heated by means of pit-coal, on a grate; and, as may be seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, has a chimney of considerable height, in which there is a damper, to regulate the degree of heat while puddling. A considerable portion of the space between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRATES\">grates</a> and the chimney is formed flat, and covered with a peculiar sand, possessing the properties, when heated, of becoming very hard and infusible. On this space is placed 3 or 3\u00bd cwts. of finer's metal, and the flame allowed to pass over it with the full force of the furnace. In twenty minutes, the iron assumes a yellowish white colour, and marks of fusion appear on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of the pieces; the puddler then turns up new surfaces to the flame, and keeps breaking those which have reached a softened state. This he continues, at intervals, till the charge has subsided into a thick clotted sort of fusion. The furnace, at this period, is reduced to its lowest temperature; part of the furnace bars and fire are withdrawn, and the damper nearly shut; the puddler keeps stirring and moving the iron, backwards and forwards, which now begins to ferment and emit flashes of a bluish coloured flame (the carbon passing off in the state of carbonous oxide). This operation is continued till these appearances pass off, and till the iron becomes less clotted, and begins, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the workman, to dry. His exertions are redoubled, and soon the whole charge is reduced to the state of the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>-dust; it is now said to be dry, and so totally free from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>, that it may be moved about like as much sand. At this stage of the operation the grate bars are replaced; the fire repaired; the damper elevated; and the heat is in consequence increased, though gradually. The grains of iron become tipped with a snowy whiteness, resembling the welding of iron; they no longer repel each other, but begin to adhere in small masses; these increase in size as the temperature of the furnace is raised. When the charge begins to work heavy, the puddler selects a nucleus, and rolls it over and over upon the coalescing masses, till he has got it of the weight of 60 or 70 lbs.; he then places this on the flame side of the furnace, and anew he begins the operation of balling; repeating this till the whole charge is balled up. A heavy iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, called a Dolly, is then introduced into the furnace, and with this the balls are in succession beat to give them more cohesion in rolling. When properly heated, they are removed by tongs from the furnace, and slid along iron plates to the rolling machine. Here the lumps or balls are each, in succession, passed through rollers, grooved diagonally, acquiring, as they pass, additional cohesion and firmness, and assuming the form of a bloom. This is then presented to another pair of rollers, with flat openings or grooves, and rolled into a bar of three or four inches in breadth, and from half an inch to three-fourths of an inch in thickness. The whole operation of rolling one of the balls is performed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and a-half; and pleases, while it astonishes the observer, by the rapid change which is thus passed upon matter the most unshapely and refractory. The whole time taken up to complete a charge from the puddling furnace is only from two to two and a half hours; the loss sustained is from 10 to 12 per cent. One furnace will discharge five or six heats in twelve hours, and make in one week from ten to twelve tons of rough bars. A set of rollers, moved by a thirty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> power, will rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in a week 200 tons of such iron, and keep twenty puddling furnaces at work, for which three or four refineries or running out fires will be necessary. The material thus produced is called mill bars, and require another operation before they are finished. For this purpose they are carried to a pair of large steel shears, and cut into regular lengths, proportionate to the bar ultimately intended to be made. These pieces are then piled on each other in reference to the required thickness, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> was to the requisite lengths, and are introduced into the reheating furnace. A welding\nheat, by the flame of pit coal, is here brought upon them in the space of twenty minutes; they are then, one by one, taken to another set of rollers, similar to the first, and in the diagonal grooves each pile is brought down to a certain size; they are then put into the finishing rollers, and rapidly formed into bars of the most perfect form, and most accurate dimensions. At one of the most perfect works in this or any country, one bar of iron per minute is finished for hours in succession, and one set of rollers have finished, in twelve hours, twenty tons of bar iron of the most perfect form. This formerly would have been full work for a week in any large manufactory of iron.\n\nSuch has been the extension of the iron trade in this kingdom, mainly owing to the great facility presented by puddling and rolling. That the Cyfarthfa Iron Works alone manufacture annually double the quantity of pig and bar iron made in the whole kingdom between the years 1740 and 1750, and a quantity nearly equal to one half of the whole make as it stood so late as 1788. Several iron establishments, on a smaller scale, finish from 200 to 300 tons; and few there are which do not manufacture regularly 100 to 150 tons weekly. In South Wales alone, there are now made yearly upwards of 80,000 tons of bars; and, in the whole kingdom, besides, nearly 120,000 tons more, making in all 200,000 tons. One of the paramount advantages of the present system is the facility and cheapness of rolling. Iron of every possible size and form can now be obtained at the common price of bars. The labour of the smith, in forging and drawing, are now almost unknown, and the price of his work proportionally reduced.\n\nIt is painful to know that, incalculable as have been, and are likely to be, the national advantages derived from the puddling process, which has given England the command of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> of the world, Mr Cort, the inventor, after expending an ample fortune in bringing the system to perfection, died, and a respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> survives, without having received any public acknowledgment of his services, or compensation for his losses.\n\nIron Ores.\n\nTo comprehend fully the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the separation of iron from its ores, it is necessary to examine and operate upon them in a smaller scale than that of manufacture. Ores of iron are in general mixtures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OXIDES\">oxides</a> of iron with certain earths, in every possible proportion, which, if fused alone, without any addition, would be formed into glasses more or less dense, according to the quantity of iron they contained, and in which no trace of metallic iron would be found to exist. The simple principle, therefore, in reduction, is to add a substance to which the oxygen will unite, in preference to remaining with the iron, and such other substances, with which the earthy matters of the ore would combine, on the same principle. Carbonaceous matter is found essential to perform the former part of this operation; and opposing earths contrary to each other in their natures, are found sufficient for the latter. Thus, if a common ironstone of this country is fused alone, in a common clay crucible, the result is a black glass of iron. If charcoal be added in proportion to the quantity, the iron becomes separated. As the iron separates, it forms itself into a small spherule, under the glass. When charcoal is added in excess, that is, to the extent of one-fifth or one-seventh, the weight of the ore, three-fourths of the iron, will be found revived. The deficient produce remains in the glass, or unites to the superfluous charcoal, forming a magnetic carburet of iron. If there has been an excess of clay in the ore, the glass will be found black, opaque, and concave on the surface. If of silex, deep bottle green, with brownish-coloured cells, around the metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a>.\n\nIf this experiment is repeated with one-third or one-fourth the weight of the ore of lime, other circumstances being alike, the carburet of iron will disappear, the glass will be found dense, comparatively transparent, and the produce in iron greatly increased. If the same ore alone was put into a crucible, mixed with carbonaceous matter in its texture, or into one chiefly composed of black lead, fully one-half the produce of the ore would be revived. Or, if masses of the same ore were deoxydated by a prolonged cementation with charcoal, their subsequent fusion, per se, even in a common crucible, would yield five-eighths the whole iron contained in the ore; and, if fused in a black lead crucible, seven-eighths of the whole iron would be reduced to a metallic state.\n\nWhen the first portions of iron are extracted from an ore, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> proportion of charcoal, the resulting globule is always in the state of soft or ductile iron; as the dose of carbon is increased, the iron subsequently passes through various states of steel and common crude iron; and, if properly conducted, into that of the richest carburet of iron. The quantity of reduction performed by the charcoal is various at various stages. In the first place, all the charcoal is employed to unite with the oxygen, and a certain additional quantity beyond this must be used, before iron is produced. After this the rate of reduction is increased, till more than one-half the iron is revived; it then falls off, upon the well-known ground that the last portions are always most difficult to extract. Much larger doses of charcoal, in proportion, are necessary; and it is essential to perfect separation that not only all the oxygen be removed from the ores, but that the resulting iron itself should take up a considerable portion of the carbon so added. The table subjoined will more clearly illustrate these hitherto unknown facts.\n\nIf a calcareous ore is subjected to fusion in a clay crucible, it will melt with facility, in proportion to the quantity of iron united with the lime, and form a black shining lustrous glass. If charcoal is added, the iron will separate; but if it is added in excess, the ore will become refractory, and not melt. The same ore, thrown into a black lead crucible, will sink down into a rough mass, without any separation of iron. If an argillaceous substance is added, fusion and a fine glass will ensue; and if a proper quantity of charcoal is present, the same will be transparent. If the argillaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is diminished without any change in the charcoal, a pure white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> will be obtained over the iron, similar to, though much\nmore perfect than the cruddley or limy cinder of the blast-furnace.\n\nThe fusion of a siliceous ore of iron, per se, affords a highly polished shining glass of iron, the fracture of which frequently decomposes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. On the addition of charcoal, an imperfect, ropy fusion is obtained. The siliceous matter is then resolved into a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or yellowish glass, streaked with glass of iron, and the separated iron thrown about the crucible in a state of small globules of a silvery colour, which are generally understood to be an alloy of iron and the metal of silex. When the silex exists in small quantities, compared with the oxyde of iron, as is the case with the Lancashire and Cumberland ores, the whole of the iron may be revived with charcoal alone, and the earthy matter remain unfused, but in an agglutinated state.\n\nOres of iron are in themselves frequently united with such a mixture of earths, as to render, with the proper dose of carbon, the most transparent glasses, and iron of the most perfect quality. If the ores are rich, an inconvenience is sustained, by the metallic button being on its upper surface exposed without a covering of glass. This not only tends to decarbonate the iron, but, if in a state of ebullition, allows it to be projected against the sides and cover of the crucible, and makes the product difficult to ascertain.\n\nThe following is a table or abstract of a set of experiments, made with a common blast-furnace ironstone, in which experiments, lime, deprived of its carbonic acid, predominated as a flux, but to which other substances were added, to prove their effect in facilitating or retarding, with the same or different proportions of charcoal, the reduction of the metal from the ore. The ore itself had been previously assayed for carbureted cast iron, and yielded 46 per cent.\n\nTable of the Reduction of Ironstones.\n\n| Weight of the Mixture Grains | Grs. of Iron contained |

LXXXVIII.**\n\nFig. 1, Represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of an air-bloomery furnace, similar to that used by the Africans, as stated by Mr Park in his *Travels*.\n\nFig. 2, A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> section of the same furnace across the openings, used for the admission of air, and discharging the furnace.\n\nFig. 3, Represents a section of the old blast-bloomery, with its bellows and lifters, which was universally used for the manufacture of malleable iron before the invention of the blast-furnace, and the discovery of the manufacture of pig-iron.\n\nFig. 4, A ground <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the same furnace, showing the bellows and blast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, and A, the opening which was regularly broken down at the end of each heat, to remove the bloom of iron from the bottom to the hammer. These bellows were worked in a very simple manner, without the assistance of levers, by a man alternately depressing the upper board of each, by merely treading thereon, which, in its turn, was again elevated by means of the lifter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> weight. The stream of air, in this way, was prolonged with but little pause or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>.\n\nFig. 5, Is a section of the building, and interior of the charcoal blast-furnace, about the time of its first application for the purpose of making pig-iron. The remains of a furnace similarly constructed were accidentally discovered, in making an excavation, about eight years ago, in Dean Forest. This furnace, along with many others in ancient times, belonged to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>, were called *King's Furnaces*, and were probably used for the purposes of smelting, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>-wood of the forest, the King's share of the iron ore obtained from the mines.\n\nFrom its situation on the margin of a small stream, and the remains of the water course, the bellows must have been worked by means of a small water wheel. The height of this furnace, from A to B, judging by the dimensions of the hearth and boshes, which were found entire, could not have exceeded 20 feet. The height of the hearth, from A to C, 4 feet, and the height of the boshes, from C to D, 2\u00bd feet.

I quote the passage, as it enters into some historical details which she has omitted, and describes more explicitly than she has done one of the most important steps, which Kant is supposed by his disciples to have made beyond his predecessors. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> it, some allowances must be made for the peculiar phraseology of the German school.\n\n\"Kant discovered that the intuitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of very dissimilar ingredients; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, in other words, that it consists of parts very different in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, each of which performs functions peculiar to itself; namely, the sensitive faculty, and the understanding. . . . Leibnitz, indeed, had likewise remarked the distinction subsisting between the sensitive faculty and the understanding; but he entirely overlooked the essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between their functions, and was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the faculties differed from one another only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. . . . In the works of the English and French philosophers, we find this essential distinction between the sensitive and the intellectual faculties, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> towards producing one synthetical intuition scarcely mentioned. Locke only alludes to the accidental limitations of both faculties; but to inquire into the essential difference between them does not at all occur to him. . . . This distinction, then, between the sensitive and the intellectual faculties, forms an essential feature in the philosophy of Kant, and is, indeed, the basis upon which most of his subsequent inquiries are established.\" (Elements of the Crit. Phil. by A. F. M. Willich, M. D. pp. 68, 69, 70.)\n\nIt is a circumstance not easily explicable, that, in the foregoing historical sketch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention is made of the name of Cudworth, author of the treatise on Eternal and Immutable Morality; a book which could scarcely fail to be known, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> in question, to\n\nimplies a rash and unphilosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a>. \"The appellation Empiric (says the late Dr John Gregory) is generally applied to one who, from observing the effects of a remedy in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, applies it to all the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of that distemper.\" The same remark may be extended to the word Empirique in the French language, which is very nearly synonymous with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARLATAN\">Charlatan</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this abuse of terms, the epithet experimental, as well as empirical, is seldom applied by foreign writers to the philosophy of Locke, without being intended to convey a censure.\nevery German scholar, by the admirable Latin version of it published by Dr Mosheim. In this treatise, Cudworth is at much pains to illustrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> doctrine concerning the difference between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and intellect; asserting that \"some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the mind proceed not from outward sensible objects, but arise from the inward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the mind itself;\" that \"even simple corporeal things, passively perceived by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, are known and understood only by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> power of the mind;\" and that, besides and , there must be or intelligible ideas, the source of which can be traced to the understanding alone.\n\nIn the course of his speculations on these subjects, Cudworth has blended, with some very deep and valuable discussions, several opinions to which I cannot assent, and not a few\n\n---\n\n1 The first edition of this translation was printed as early as 1732. From Buhle's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> Philosophy (a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> was written), I find that Cudworth's Treatise of Immutable Morality is now not only well known to the scholars of Germany, but that some of them have remarked the identity of the doctrines contained in it with those of Kant. \"Meiners, dans son histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Ethique nie que le syst\u00e8me morale de Cudworth soit identique avec celui de Platon, et pr\u00e9tend au contraire, 'que les principes consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme appartenant de la mani\u00e8re la plus sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la morale de Kant, \u00e9taient enseign\u00e9s il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs g\u00e9n\u00e9rations par l'\u00e9cole du philosophe Anglais.'\" (Hist. de la Phil. Moderne, Tom. III. p. 577.) In opposition to this, Buhle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> his own decided conviction\u2014\"qu'aucune des id\u00e9es de Cudworth ne se rapproche de celles de Kant.\" (Ibid.) How far this conviction is well founded, the passage from Cudworth, quoted in the text, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> enable my readers to judge for themselves.\n\nThat Cudworth has blended with his principles a vein of Platonic mysticism, which is not to be found in Kant, is undeniable; but it does not follow from this, that none of Kant's leading ideas are borrowed from the writings of Cudworth.\n\nThe assertion of Buhle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, is the more surprising, as he himself acknowledges that\u2014\"La philosophie morale de Price pr\u00e9sente en effet une analogie frappante avec celle de Kant;\" and in another part of his work, he expresses himself thus on the same subject: \"Le plus remarquable de tous les moralistes modernes de l'Angleterre est, sans contredit, Richard Price. . . . On remarque l'analogie la plus frappante entre ses id\u00e9es sur les bases de la moralit\u00e9, et celles que la philosophie critique a fait na\u00eetre en Allemagne, quoique il ne soit cependant pas possible d'\u00e9lever le plus petit doute sur l'enti\u00e8re originalit\u00e9 de ces derni\u00e8res.\" (Tom. V. p. 303.) Is there any thing of importance in the system of Price, which is not borrowed from the Treatise of Immutable Morality? The distinguishing merit of this learned and most respectable writer is the good sense with which he has applied the doctrines of Cudworth to the sceptical theories of his own times.\n\nIn the sequel of Buhle's reflections on Cudworth's philosophy, we are told, that, according to him, \"the will of God is only a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> power, acting mechanically or accidentally.\" (\"Chez Cudworth la volont\u00e9 m\u00eame en Dieu, n'est qu'un simple pouvoir aveugle, agissant m\u00e9caniquement ou accidentellement.\") <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this were true, Cudworth ought to be ranked among the disciples, not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, but of Spinoza.\n\n2 In this instance, a striking resemblance is observable between the language of Cudworth and that of Kant; both of them having followed the distinctions of the Socratic school, as explained in the Theaetetus of Plato. They who are at all acquainted with Kant's Critique, will immediately recognise his phraseology in the passage quoted above.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> which I am unable to comprehend; but he seems to have advanced at least as far as Kant, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the line between the provinces of the senses and of the understanding; and although not one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> of our English writers, he must be allowed to be far superior to the German metaphysician, both in point of perspicuity and of precision.\n\nA later writer, too, of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> (Dr Price), a zealous follower both of Plato and of Cudworth, afterwards resumed the same argument, in a work which appeared long before the *Critique of Pure Reason*; and urged it with much force against those modern metaphysicians, who consider the senses as the sources of all our knowledge. At a period somewhat earlier, many very interesting quotations of a similar import had been produced by the learned Mr Harris, from the later commentators of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a> school on the philosophy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>; and had been advantageously contrasted by him with the account given of the origin of our ideas, not only by Hobbes and Gassendi, but by many of the professed followers of Locke. If this part of the Kantian system, therefore, was new in Germany, it certainly could have no claim to the praise of originality, in the estimation of those at all acquainted with English literature.\n\n---\n\n1 See a review of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">Principal</a> Questions and Difficulties relating to Morals*, by Richard Price, D.D., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1758.\n\n2 I have mentioned here only those works of a modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, which may be reasonably presumed to be still in general circulation among the learned. But many very valuable illustrations of the Platonic distinction between the senses and the understanding may be collected from the English writers of the seventeenth century. Among these it is sufficient to mention at present the names of John Smith and Henry More of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Glanville, the author of *Scepsis Scientifica*.\n\nCudworth's *Treatise of Eternal and Immutable Morality*, although it appears, from intrinsic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, to have been composed during the lifetime of Hobbes, was not published till 1731, when the author's manuscript came into the hands of his grandson, Francis Cudworth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASHAM\">Masham</a>, one of the Masters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHANCERY\">Chancery</a>. This work, therefore, could not have been known to Leibnitz, who died seventeen years before; a circumstance which may help to account for its having attracted so much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in Germany than his *Intellectual System*, which is repeatedly mentioned by Leibnitz in terms of the highest praise.\n\nFrom an article in the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review* (Vol. XXVII. p. 191), we learn, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> unpublished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> of Dr Cudworth are deposited in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>. It is much to be regretted (as the author of the article observes), that they should have been so long withheld from the public. \"The press of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">Universities</a> (he adds) would be properly employed in works, which a commercial publisher could not prudently undertake.\" May we not indulge a hope, that this suggestion will, sooner or later, have its due effect?\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> of Mosheim to his Latin version of the *Intellectual System*, there is a catalogue of Cudworth's unpublished remains, communicated to Mosheim by Dr Chandler, then Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>. Among these are two distinct works on the Controversy concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">Liberty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">Necessity</a>, of each of which works Mosheim has given us the general contents. One of the chapters is entitled, \"Answer to the Objection against Liberty, \u03bc\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd.\" It is not probable that it contains any thing very new or important; but it would certainly be worth while to know the reply made by Cudworth to an objection which both Leibnitz and La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> have fixed upon as decisive of the point in dispute.\nIn order, however, to strike at the root of what the Germans call the philosophy of sensation, it was necessary to trace, with some degree of systematical detail, the origin of our most important simple notions; and for this purpose it seemed reasonable to begin with an analytical view of those faculties and powers, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of which the development of these notions is necessarily subsequent. It is thus that the simple notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> presuppose the exercise of the faculty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>; and that the simple notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, of doubt, and many others of the same kind, necessarily presuppose the exercise of the power of reasoning. I do not know, that, in this anatomy of the mind, much progress has hitherto been made by the German metaphysicians. A great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> certainly has been accomplished by the late Dr Reid; and something, perhaps, has been added to his labours by those of his successors.\n\nAccording to Kant himself, his metaphysical doctrines first occurred to him while employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of Mr Hume's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">Causation</a>. The train of thought by which he was led to them will be best stated in his own words; for it is in this way alone that I can hope to escape the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of misrepresentation from his followers. Some of his details would perhaps have been more intelligible to my readers, had my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> allowed me to prefix to them a slight outline of Hume's philosophy. But this the general arrangement of my discourse rendered impossible; nor can any material inconvenience result, in this instance, from the order which I have adopted, inasmuch as Hume's Theory of Causation, how new soever it may have appeared to Kant, is fundamentally the same with that of Malebranche, and of a variety of other old writers, both French and English.\n\n1 \"Since the Essays (says Kant) of Locke and of Leibnitz, or rather since the origin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, as far as their history extends, no circumstance has occurred, which might have been more decisive of the fate of this science than the attack made upon it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Hume.\" He proceeded upon a single but important idea in metaphysics, the connection of cause and effect, and the concomitant notions of power and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. He challenged reason to answer him what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> she had to imagine, that anything may be so constituted.\n\n---\n\n1 See the Preface of Kant to one of his Treatises, entitled Prolegomena <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> Metaphysicam quamque futuram qua qua Scientia poterit prodire. I have availed myself in the text of the English version of Dr Willich, from the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, which I have carefully compared with the Latin version of Born. A few sentences, omitted by Willich, I have thought it worth while to quote, at the foot of the page, from the Latin translation. (Elem. of Critical Philosophy, by A. F. M. Willich, M. D. p. 10, et seq. London, 1798.)\n\n2 \"Humius.\u2014Qui quidem nullam huic cognitionis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTI\">parti</a> lucem adfudit, sed tamen excitavit scintillam, de qua sane lumen potuisse accendi, si ea incidisset in fomitem, facile accipientem, cujusque scintillatio dilingenter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTA\">alta</a> fuerit et aucta.\"\nas that, if it be given, something else is also thereby inferred; for the idea of cause denotes this. He proved beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, that it is impossible for reason to think of such a connection \\textit{\u00e0 priori}, for it contains \\textit{necessity}; but it is not possible to perceive how, because something is, something else must necessarily be; nor how the idea of such a connection can be introduced \\textit{\u00e0 priori}.\n\n\"Hence, he concluded, that reason entirely deceives herself with this idea, and that she erroneously considers it as her own child, when it is only the spurious offspring of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, impregnated by experience; a \\textit{subjective} necessity, arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of ideas being thus substituted for an \\textit{objective} one derived from perception. . . . However hasty and unwarrantable Hume's conclusion might appear, yet it was founded upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>; and this investigation well deserved, that some of the philosophers of his time should have united to solve, more happily if possible, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> in the sense in which he delivered it: A complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> of the science might have resulted from this solution. But it is a mortifying reflection, that his opponents, Reid, Beattie, Oswald, and, lastly, Priestley himself, totally misunderstood the \\textit{tendency} of his problem. The question was not, whether the idea of cause be in itself proper and indispensable to the illustration of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> knowledge, for this Hume had never doubted; but whether this idea be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of thought through reasoning \\textit{\u00e0 priori}; and whether, in this manner, it possesses internal evidence, independently of all experience; consequently, whether its utility be not limited to objects of sense alone. It was upon this point that Hume expected an explanation.\"\n\n\"I freely own it was these suggestions of Hume's which first, many years ago, roused me from my dogmatical slumber, and gave to my inquiries quite a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in the field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy. I was far from being carried away by his conclusions, the fallacy of which chiefly arose from his not forming to himself an idea of the whole of his problem, but merely investigating a part of it, the solution of which was impossible without a comprehensive view of the whole. When we proceed on a well founded,\n\n---\n\n1 \"Non potest sine certo quodam molestiae sensu percipi, quantopere ejus adversarii, Reidius, Oswaldus, Beattius, et tandem Priestleus, a scopo questionis abberrarent, et propterea, quod ea semper acciperent pro concessis, que ipse in dubium vocaret, contra vero cum vehementia, et maximam partem cum ingenti immodestia ea probare gestirent, que illi nunquam in mentem venisset dubitare, nutum ejus ad emendationem ita negligentur, ut omnia in statu pristino manerent; quasi nihil quidquam factum videretur.\"\n\n2 Although nothing can be more unjust than these remarks, in the unqualified form in which they are stated by Kant, it must, I think, be acknowledged, that some grounds for them have been furnished by occasional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> which dropped from the pens of most of Mr Hume's Scottish opponents.\nthough not thoroughly digested thought, we may expect; by patient and continued reflection, to prosecute it farther than the acute genius had done to whom we are indebted for the first spark of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. I first inquired, therefore, whether Hume's objection might not be a general one, and soon found, that the idea of cause and effect is far from being the only one, by which the understanding *a priori* thinks of the connection of things; but rather that the science of metaphysics is altogether founded upon these connections. I endeavoured to ascertain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; and, having succeeded in this attempt, I proceeded to the examination of those general ideas, which, I was now convinced, are not, as Hume apprehended, derived from experience, but arise out of the pure understanding. This deduction, which seemed impossible to my acute predecessor, and which nobody besides him had ever conceived, although every one makes use of these ideas, without asking himself upon what their objective validity is founded; this deduction, I say, was the most difficult which could have been undertaken for the behoof of metaphysics; and what was still more embarrassing, metaphysics could not here offer me the smallest assistance, because that deduction ought first to establish the possibility of a system of metaphysics. As I had now succeeded in the explanation of Hume's problem, not merely in a particular instance, but with a view of the whole power of pure reason, I could advance with sure though tedious steps, to determine completely, and upon general principles, the compass of Pure Reason, both what is the sphere of its exertion, and what are its limits; which was all that was required for erecting a system of metaphysics upon a proper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundation.\"\n\nIt is difficult to discover any thing in the foregoing passage on which Kant could found a claim to the slightest originality. A variety of English writers had, long before this work appeared, replied to Mr. Hume, by observing that the understanding is itself a source of new ideas, and that it is from this source that our notions of cause and effect are derived. \"Our certainty (says Dr Price) that every new event requires some cause, depends no more on experience than our certainty of any other the most obvious subject of intuition. In the idea of every change, is included that of its being an effect.\"\u00b9 In the works of Dr Reid, many remarks of the same nature are to be found; but, instead of quoting any of these, I shall produce a passage from a much older author, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of thinking and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> may perhaps be more agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of Kant's countrymen than the simplicity and precision aimed at by the disciples of Locke.\n\n\u00b9 Review of the Principal Questions and Difficulties in Morals, Chap. i. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 2. The first edition of this book was printed in 1758.\n\"That there are some ideas of the mind (says Dr Cudworth), which were not stamped or imprinted upon it from the sensible objects without, and therefore must needs arise from the innate vigour and activity of the mind itself, is evident, in that there are, First, Ideas of such things as are neither affections of bodies, nor could be imprinted or conveyed by any local motions, nor can be pictured at all by the fancy in any sensible colours; such as are the ideas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, folly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, imprudence, knowledge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, verity, falsity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, vice, honesty, dishonesty, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, injustice, volition, cogitation, nay of sense itself, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of cogitation, and which is not perceptible by any sense; and many other such like notions as include something of cogitation in them, or refer to cogitative beings only; which ideas must needs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the active power and innate fecundity of the mind itself, because the corporeal objects of sense can imprint no such things upon it. Secondly, In that there are many relative notions and ideas, attributed as well to corporeal as incorporeal things, that proceed wholly from the activity of the mind comparing one thing with another. Such as are Cause, Effect, means, end, order, proportion, similitude, dissimilitude, equality, inequality, aptitude, inaptitude, symmetry, asymmetry, whole and part, genus and species, and the like.\"\u2014*Immutable Morality*, pp. 148, 149.\n\nIt is not my business at present to inquire into the solidity of the doctrine here maintained. I would only wish to be informed what additions have been made by Kant to the reply given to Mr Hume by our English philosophers, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the attention of my readers to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> resemblance between this part of Kant's system, and the argument which Cudworth opposed to Hobbes and Gassendi considerably more than a century ago.\n\nThe following passage, from the writer last quoted, approaches so nearly to what Kant and other Germans have so often repeated of the distinction between subjective and objective truth, that I am tempted to connect it with the foregoing extract, as an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that there are, at least, some metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, on which we need not search for instruction beyond our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>.\n\n\"If there were no other perceptive power, or faculty, distinct from external sense, all our perceptions would be merely relative, seeming, and fantastical, and not reach to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and certain truth of any thing; and every one would but, as Protagoras expounds,\n\n---\n\n1 This is precisely the language of the German school: \"Les verit\u00e9s necessaires (says Leibnitz) sont le produit immediat de l'activit\u00e9 interieure.\" (Tome I. p. 686. Tome II. pp. 42, 325. See Degerando, Hist. Comp. Tome II. p. 96.)\n\n2 In the attempt, indeed, which Kant has made to enumerate all the general ideas which are not derived from experience, but arise out of the pure understanding, he may well lay claim to the praise of originality. On this subject I shall only refer my readers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> (DD) at the end of this Dissertation.\n\"think his own private and relative thoughts truths,\" and all our cogitations being nothing but appearances, would be indifferently alike true phantasms, and one as another.\n\n\"But we have since also demonstrated, that there is another perceptive power in the soul superior to outward sense, and of a distinct nature from it, which is the power of knowing or understanding, that is, an active exertion from the mind itself. And, therefore, has this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> eminence above sense, that it is no idiopathy, not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> private, relative, seeming, and fantastical thing, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of that which absolutely is and is not.\"\u00b9\n\nAfter enlarging on the distinction between the sensitive faculty and the understanding, Kant proceeds to investigate certain essential conditions, without which neither the sensitive faculty nor its objects are conceivable. These conditions are time and space, which, in the language of Kant, are the forms of all phenomena. What his peculiar ideas are concerning their nature and attributes, my readers will find stated in his own words at the end of this Discourse, in an extract from one of his Latin publications.\u00b2 From that extract, I cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> them much instruction; but it will at least enable them to judge for themselves of the peculiar character of Kant's metaphysical phraseology. In the meantime, it will be sufficient to mention here, for the sake of connection, that he denies the objective reality both of time and of space. The former he considers merely as a subjective condition, inseparably connected with the frame of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind, in consequence of which, it arranges sensible phenomena according to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, in the order of succession. As to the latter, he asserts, that it is nothing objective or real, inasmuch as it is neither a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation; that its existence, therefore, is only subjective and ideal, depending on a fixed law, inseparable from the frame of the human mind. In consequence of this law, we are led to conceive all external things as placed in space; or (as Kant expresses it) we are led to consider space as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> form of every external sensation.\n\nIn selecting Kant's speculations concerning time and space, as a specimen of his mode of writing, I was partly influenced by the consideration, that it furnishes, at the same time, a remarkable example of the concatenation which exists between the most remote and seemingly the most unconnected parts of his system. Who could suppose that his opinions on these subjects, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> and the most controverted of any in the whole compass of metaphysics, bore on the great practical question of the freedom of the Human Will? The combination appears, at first sight, so very extraordinary, that I have no\n\n\u00b9 Immutable Morality, p. 264, et seq.\n\u00b2 See Note (EE.)\ndoubt I shall gratify the curiosity of some of my readers by mentioning a few of the intermediate steps which, in this argument, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> from the premises to the conclusion.\n\nThat Kant conceived the free agency of man to be necessarily implied in his moral nature (or, at least, that he was anxious to offer no violence to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> language of the world on this point), appears from his own explicit declarations in various parts of his works. \"Voluntas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERA\">libera</a> (says he in one instance) eadem est cum voluntate legibus moralibus obnoxia.\"\n\nIn all the accounts of Kant's philosophy, which have yet appeared from the pens of his admirers in this country, particular stress is laid on the ingenuity with which he has unloosed this knot, which had baffled the wisdom of all his predecessors. The following are the words of one of his own pupils, to whom we are indebted for the first, and, I think, not the least intelligible, view of his principles which has been published in our language.\n\n\"Professor Kant is decidedly of opinion, that, although many strong and ingenious arguments have been brought forward in favour of the freedom of the will, they are yet very far from being decisive. Nor have they refuted the arguments urged by the Necessitarians, but by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to mere feeling, which, on such a question, is of no avail. For this purpose, it is indispensably necessary to call to our assistance the principles of Kant.\"\n\n\"In treating this subject (continues the same author), Kant begins with showing that the notion of a Free Will is not contradictory. In proof of this he observes, that, although every human action, as an event in time, must have a cause, and so on ad infinitum; yet it is certain, that the laws of cause and effect can have a place there only where time is, for the effect must be consequent on the cause. But neither time nor space are properties of things; they are only the general forms under which man is allowed to view himself and the world. It follows, therefore, that man is not in time nor in space, al-\n\n---\n\n1 See Born's Latin Translation of Kant's Works, relating to the Critical Philosophy, Vol. II. p. 325, et seq. See also the Preface to Vol. III.\n\n2 A General and Introductory View of Professor Kant's Principles concerning Man, the World, and the Deity, submitted to the consideration of the Learned, by F. A. Nitsch, late Lecturer on the Latin Language and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Fredericianum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> at K\u00f6nigsberg, and pupil of Professor Kant. London, 1796. Pp. 172, 173.\n\nThis small performance is spoken of in terms highly favourable, by the other writers who have attempted to introduce Kant's philosophy into England. It is called by Dr Willich an excellent publication (Elements of the Critical Philosophy, p. 62); and is pronounced by the author of the elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on that subject in the Encyclopaedia Londinensis to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> work. \"Though at present very little known, I may venture (says this writer) to predict, that, as time rolls on, and prejudices moulder away, this work, like the Elements of Euclid, will stand forth as a lasting monument of pure truth.\"\u2014See Note (FF.)\nthough the forms of his intuitive ideas are time and space. But if man exist not in time and space, he is not influenced by the laws of time and space, among which those of cause and effect hold a distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>; it is, therefore, no contradiction to conceive, that, in such an order of things, man may be free.\"\n\nIn this manner Kant establishes the possibility of man's freedom; and, farther than this, he does not conceive himself warranted to proceed on the principles of the critical philosophy. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, certainly, which his argument produces on the mind is, that his own opinion was favourable to the scheme of necessity. For if the reasonings of the Necessitarians be admitted to be satisfactory, and if nothing can be opposed to them but the incomprehensible proposition, that man neither exists in space nor in time, the natural inference is, that this proposition was brought forward rather to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> appearances, than as a serious objection to the universality of the conclusion.\n\nHere, however, Kant calls to his aid the principles of what he calls practical reason. Deeply impressed with a conviction that morality is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> concern of man, and that morality and the freedom of the human will must stand or fall together, he exerts his ingenuity to show, that the metaphysical proof already brought of the possibility of free-agency, joined to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of a liberty of choice, affords evidence of the fact fully sufficient for the practical regulation of our conduct, although not amounting to what is represented as demonstration in the Critique of Pure Reason.\n\n1 Nitsch, &c. pp. 174, 175.\n2 The account of this part of Kant's doctrine given by M. Buhle agrees in substance with that of Mr Nitsch: \"Toute moralit\u00e9 des actions repose uniquement sur la disposition pratique, en tant qu'elle est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la loi morale seule. Si l'on consid\u00e8re <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> disposition comme ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne dans la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>; c'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement naturel, elle ob\u00e9it \u00e0 la loi de la causalit\u00e9, elle repose sur se que l'homme a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 auparavant dans le temps, et elle fait partie du caract\u00e8re empirique de l'homme. Mais on peut aussi la consid\u00e9rer comme un acte de la libert\u00e9 raisonnante: Alors elle n'est plus soumise \u00e0 la loi de la causalit\u00e9; elle est ind\u00e9pendante de la condition du temps, elle se rapporte \u00e0 une cause intelligible, la libert\u00e9, et elle fait partie du caract\u00e8re intelligible de l'homme. On ne peut, \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, point acqu\u00e9rir la moindre connaissance des objets intelligibles; mais la libert\u00e9 n'est pas moins un fait de la conscience. Donc les actions ext\u00e9rieures sont indiff\u00e9rentes pour la moralit\u00e9 de l'homme. La bont\u00e9 morale de l'homme consiste uniquement dans sa volont\u00e9 moralement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONNE\">bonne</a>, et celle-ci consiste en ce que la volont\u00e9 soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la loi morale seule.\" (Hist. de la Philosophie Moderne, par J. G. Buhle, Tom. VI. pp. 504, 505.)\n\nVery nearly to the same purpose is the following statement by the ingenious author of the article Leibnitz in the Biographie Universelle: \"Comment accorder le fatum et la libert\u00e9, l'imputation morale et la d\u00e9pendance des \u00eatres finis? Kant croit \u00e9chapper \u00e0 cet \u00e9cueil en ne soumettant \u00e0 la loi de causalit\u00e9 (au d\u00e9terminisme de Leibnitz) que le monde ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nique, et en affranchissant de ce principe l'\u00e2me comme nou- m\u00e8ne ou chose en soi, envisageant ainsi chaque action comme appartenant \u00e0 un <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> s\u00e9rie \u00e0 la fois; \u00e0 l'ordre physique o\u00f9 elle est ench\u00e2in\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et \u00e0 ce qui <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> par les liens communs de la nature, et\nIt is impossible to combine together these two parts of the Kantian system, without being struck with the resemblance they bear to the deceitful sense of liberty to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames had recourse (in the first edition of his Essays on Morality and Natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>), in order to reconcile our consciousness of free-agency with the conclusions of the Necessitarians. In both cases, the reader is left in a state of most uncomfortable scepticism, not confined to this particular question, but extending to every other subject which can give employment to the human faculties.\n\nIn some respects, the functions ascribed by Kant to his practical reason are analogous to those ascribed to common sense in the writings of Beattie and Oswald. But his view of the subject is, on the whole, infinitely more exceptionable than theirs, inasmuch as it sanctions the supposition, that the conclusions of pure reason are, in certain instances, at variance with that modification of reason which was meant by our Maker to be our guide in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; whereas the constant language of the other writers is, that all the different parts of our intellectual frame are in the most perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> with each other. The motto which Beattie has prefixed to his book,\n\n\"Nunquam aliud natura, aliud sapientia dicit,\"\n\nexpresses, in a few significant words, the whole substance of his philosophy.\n\nIt is to the same practical modification of reason that Kant appeals in favour of the existence of the Deity, and of a future state of retribution, both of which articles of belief he thinks derive the whole of their evidence from the moral nature of man. His system, therefore, as far as I am able to comprehend it, tends rather to represent these as useful credenda, than as certain or even as probable truths. Indeed, the whole of his moral superstructure will be found to rest ultimately on no better basis than the metaphysical conundrum, that the human mind (considered as a noumenon and not as a phenomenon) neither exists in space nor in time.\n\n\u00e0 l'ordre morale, ou une d\u00e9termination produit un effet, sans que pour expliquer cette volition et son r\u00e9sultat, on soit renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9tat ant\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\"\n\nThe author of the above passage is M. Staffer, to whom we are indebted for the article Kant in the same work. For Kant's own view of the subject consult his Critique of Pure Reason, passim, particularly p. 99, et seq. of Born's Translation, Vol. III.\n\n1 The idea of Kant (according to his own explicit avowal) was, that every being, which conceives itself to be free, whether it be in reality so or not, is rendered by its own belief a moral and accountable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>.\n\n\"Jam equidem dico: qu\u00e6que natura, qua non potest, nisi sub idea libertatis agere, propter id ipsum, respectu practico, reipsa libera est; hoc est, ad eam valent cunct\u00e6 leges, cum libertate arctissime conjunct\u00e6,\nThat it was Kant's original aim to establish a system of scepticism, I am far from being disposed to think. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is, that he began with a serious wish to refute the doctrines of Hume; and that, in the progress of his inquiries, he met with obstacles of which he was not aware. It was to remove these obstacles that he had recourse to practical reason; an idea which has every appearance of being an afterthought, very remote from his views when he first undertook his work. This, too, would seem, from the following passage (which I translate from Degerando), to have been the opinion of one of Kant's ablest German commentators, M. Reinhold: \"Practical Reason (as Reinhold ingeniously observes) is a wing which Kant has prudently added to his edifice, from a sense of the inadequacy of the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to answer the intended purpose. It bears a manifest resemblance to what some philosophers call an appeal to sentiment, founding belief on the necessity of acting. Whatever contempt Kant may affect for popular systems of philosophy, this manner of considering the subject is not unlike the disposition of those who, feeling their inability to obtain, by the exercise of their reason, a direct conviction of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> creed, cling to it nevertheless with a blind eagerness, as a support essential to their morals and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>.\" (Hist. Compar\u00e9e, Vol. II. pp. 243, 244.)\n\nThe extraordinary impression produced for a considerable time in Germany, by the Critique of Pure Reason, is very shrewdly, and I suspect justly, accounted for by the writer last quoted: \"The system of Kant was well adapted to flatter the weaknesses of the hu-\n\nperinde, ac voluntas ejus etiam per se ipsam, et in philosophia theoretica probata, libera declaretur.\" (Kantii <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, Vol. II. p. 326.)\n\nThis is also the creed professed by the Abb\u00e9 Galiani, a much more dangerous moralist than Kant, because he is always intelligible, and often extremely lively and amusing. \"L'homme est donc libre, puisqu'il est intimement persuad\u00e9 de l'\u00eatre, et que cela vaut tout autant que la libert\u00e9. Voila donc le m\u00e9chanisme de l'univers expliqu\u00e9 clair comme de l'eau de roche.\" The same author farther remarks, \"La persuasion de la libert\u00e9 constitue l'essence de l'homme. On pourrait m\u00eame d\u00e9finir l'homme un animal qui se croit libre, et ce serait une d\u00e9finition compl\u00e8te.\" (Correspondance in\u00e9dite de l'Abb\u00e9 Galiani, Tome I. pp. 339, 340. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1818.)\n\nOn the contrary, he declares explicitly (and I give him full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> for the sincerity of his words), that he considered his Critique of Pure Reason as the only effectual antidote against the opposite extremes of scepticism and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, as well as against various heretical doctrines which at present infect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of philosophy. \"Hac igitur sol\u00e1 (Philosophia Critica) et materialismi, et fatalismi, et Atheismi, et diffidentiae profane, et fanatismi, et superstitionis, quorum virus ad universos potest penetrare, tandemque etiam et idealismi, et scepticismi, qui magis scholis sunt pestiferi, radices ipse possunt praecidi.\" (Kant, Pref. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">Posterior</a>, p. xxxv.)\nman mind. Curiosity was excited, by seeing paths opened which had never been trodden before. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of mystery found a secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> in the obscurity which enveloped the doctrine. The long and troublesome period of initiation was calculated to rouse the ambition of bold and adventurous spirits. Their love of singularity was gratified by the new nomenclature; while their vanity exulted in the idea of being admitted into a privileged sect, exercising, and entitled to exercise, the supreme censorship in philosophy. Even men of the most ordinary parts, on finding themselves called to so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> functions, lost sight of their real mediocrity, and conceived themselves transformed into geniuses destined to form a new era in the history of reason.\n\n\"Another inevitable effect resulted from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> change operated by Kant in his terms, in his classifications, in his methods, and in the enunciation of his problems. The intellectual powers of the greater part of the initiated were too much exhausted in the course of their long noviciate, to be qualified to judge soundly of the doctrine itself. They felt themselves, after so many windings, lost in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABYRINTH\">labyrinth</a>, and were unable to dispense with the assistance of the guide who had conducted them so far. Others, after so great a sacrifice, wanted the courage to confess to the world, or to themselves, the disappointment they had met with. They attached themselves to the doctrine in proportion to the sacrifice they had made, and estimated its value by the labour it had cost them. As for more superficial thinkers, they drew an inference from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of the form in favour of the novelty of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and from the novelty of the matter in favour of its importance.\n\n\"It is a great advantage for a sect to possess a distinguishing garb and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIVERY\">livery</a>. It was thus that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a> extended their empire so widely, and united their subjects in one common obedience. Kant had, over and above all this, the art of insisting, that his disciples should belong exclusively to himself. He explicitly announced, that he was not going to found a school of Ecclectics, but a school of his own; a school not only independent, but in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> hostile to every other; that he could admit of no compromise with any sect whatever; that he was come to overturn every thing which existed in philosophy, and to erect a new edifice on these immense ruins. The more decided and arrogant the terms were in which he announced his design, the more likely was it to succeed; for the human mind submits more easily to an unlimited than to a partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and yields itself up without reserve, rather than consent to cavil about restrictions and conditions even in favour of its own independence.\"\n\nWith these causes of Kant's success another seems to have powerfully conspired; the indissoluble coherence and concatenation of all the different parts of his philosophy. \"It is on this concatenation (says M. Prevost) that the admiration of Kant's followers is\nchiefly founded.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">Grant</a> only (they boast) the first principles of the Critical Philosophy, and you must grant the whole system. The passage quoted on this occasion by M. Prevost is so forcibly expressed, that I cannot do it justice in an English version: \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">Ab</a> hinc enim capitibus fluere necesse est omnem philosophiae criticae rationis purae vim atque virtutem; namque in ea contextus rerum prorsus mirabilis est, ita ut extrema primis, media utrisque, omnia omnibus respondeant; si prima dederis danda sunt omnia.\" No worse account could well have been given of a philosophical work on such a subject; nor could any of its characteristical features have been pointed out more symptomatic of its ephemeral reputation. Supposing the praise to be just, it represented the system, however fair and imposing in its first aspect, as vitally and mortally vulnerable (if at all vulnerable) in every point; and, accordingly, it was fast approaching to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of its author. In Germany, at present, we are told, that a pure Kantian is scarcely to be found. But there are many Semi-Kantians and Anti-Kantians, as well as partisans of other schemes built out of the ruins of the Kantian philosophy. \"In fine (says a late author), the Critique of Pure Reason, announced with pomp, received with fanaticism, disputed about with fury, after having accomplished the overthrow of the doctrines taught by Leibnitz and Wolff, could no longer support itself upon its own foundations, and has produced no permanent result, but divisions and enmities, and a general disgust at all systematical creeds.\" If this last effect has really resulted from it (of which some doubts may perhaps be entertained), it may be regarded as a favourable symptom of a sounder taste in matters of abstract science, than has ever yet prevailed in that country.\n\n1 See some very valuable strictures on Kant, in the learned and elegant sketch of the present state of philosophy, subjoined to M. Prevost's French translation of Mr Smith's posthumous works. The Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> on the critical philosophy is quoted from a work with which I am unacquainted, Fred. Gottlob Bornii de Scientia et Conjectura.\n\n2 On this subject, see Degerando, Tom. II. p. 333.\n\n3 See Degerando, and de Bonald.\n\n4 The words in the original are, \"Un d\u00e9gout g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de toute doctrine.\" But as the same word doctrine is, in a former part of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, applied to the systems of Leibnitz and of Wolff, I have little doubt, that, in substituting for doctrine the phrase systematical creeds, I have faithfully rendered the meaning of my author. (See Recherches Philosophiques, par M. de Bonald, Tom. I. pp. 43, 44.)\n\n5 The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of the Germans for systems is a striking feature in their literary taste, and is sufficient of itself to show, that they have not yet passed their noviciate in philosophy. \"To all such (says Mr Mac-laurin) as have just notions of the Great Author of the universe, and of his admirable workmanship, all complete and finished systems must appear very suspicious.\" At the time when he wrote, such systems had not wholly lost their partisans in England; and the name of System continued to be a favourite title for a book even among writers of the highest reputation. Hence the System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral Philosophy</a> by\nTo these details, I have only to add a remark of Degerando's, which I have found amply confirmed within the circle of my own experience. It might furnish matter for some useful reflections, but I shall leave my readers to draw their own conclusions from it. \"Another remarkable circumstance is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the Kantians turned, in general, not upon the truth of the disputed proposition, but upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> interpretation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s meaning, and that their reply to all objections has constantly begun and ended with these words, You have not understood us.\"\n\nAmong the various schools which have emanated from that of Kant, those of Fichte and Schelling seem to have attracted among their countrymen the greatest number of proselytes. Of neither am I able to speak from my own knowledge; nor can I annex any distinct idea to the accounts which are given of their opinions by others. Of Fichte's speculations about the philosophical import of the pronoun \\(I\\) (Qu'est-ce que le moi? as Degerando translates the question), I cannot make anything. In some of his remarks, he approaches to the language of those Cartesians who, in the progress of their doubts, ended in absolute egoism: but the ego of Fichte has a creative power. It creates existence, and it creates science; two things (by the way) which, according to him, are one and the same. Even my own existence, he tells me, commences only with the reflex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, by which I think of the pure and primitive ego. On this identity of the intelligent ego and the existing ego (which Fichte expresses by the formula ego = ego) all science ultimately rests.\n\n\u2014But on this part of his metaphysics it would be idle to enlarge, as the author acknowledges, that it is not to be understood without the aid of a certain transcendental sense, the want of which is wholly irreparable; a singular admission enough (as Degerando observes), on the part of those critical philosophers who have treated with so much contempt the appeal to Common Sense in the writings of some of their predecessors.\n\nHutcheson, and the Complete System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> by Smith, titles which, when compared with the subsequent progress of these two sciences, reflect some degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> upon their authors.\n\nWhen this affectation of systematical method began, in consequence of the more enlarged views of philosophers, to give way to that aphoristical style so strongly recommended and so happily exemplified by Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, we find some writers of the old school complaining of the innovation, in terms not unlike those in which the philosophy of the English has been censured by some German critics. \"The best way (says Dr Watts) to learn any science, is to begin with a regular system. Now (he continues), we deal much in essays, and unreasonably despise systematical learning; whereas our fathers had a just value for regularity and systems.\" Had Dr Watts lived a few years later, I doubt not that his good sense would have led him to retract these hasty and inconsiderate decisions.\n\n1 In order to avoid the intolerable awkwardness of such a phrase as the \\(I\\), I have substituted on this occasion the Latin pronoun for the English one.\n\n2 Hist. Compar\u00e9e, &c. Tome II. pp. 300, 301. See also the article Fichte in this Supplement.\n\nDISS. I. PART II.\n\"In the history of beings there are (according to Fichte) three grand epochs; the first belongs to the empire of chance; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is the reign of nature; the third will be the epoch of the existence of God. For God does not exist yet; he only manifests himself as preparing to exist. Nature tends to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHEOSIS\">apotheosis</a>, and may be regarded as a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> in the germ.\"\n\nThe account given by Madame de Sta\u00ebl of this part of Fichte's system is considerably different: \"He was heard to say, upon one occasion, that in his next lecture he 'was going to create God,'\u2014an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which, not without reason, gave general offence. His meaning was, that he intended to show how the idea of God arose and unfolded itself in the mind of man.\" How far this apology is well-founded, I am not competent to judge.\n\nThe system of Schelling is, in the opinion of Degerando, but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of that of Fichte; connecting with it a sort of Spinozism grafted on Idealism. In considering the primitive ego as the source of all reality as well as of all science, and in thus transporting the mind into an intellectual region, inaccessible to men possessed only of the ordinary number of senses, both agree; and to this vein of transcendental mysticism may probably be ascribed the extraordinary enthusiasm with which their doctrines appear to have been received by the German youth. Since the time when Degerando wrote, a new and very unexpected revolution is said to have taken place among Schelling's disciples; many of them, originally educated in the Protestant faith, having thrown themselves into the bosom of the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. \"The union of the faithful of this school forms an invi-\n\n---\n\n1 Hist. Compar\u00e9e, &c. Tome II. p. 314. The doctrine here ascribed to Fichte by Degerando, although its unparalleled absurdity might well excite some doubts about the correctness of the historian, is not altogether a novelty in the history of philosophy. It is in point of fact nothing more than a return to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> conceptions of the mind in the infancy of human reason, which Mr Smith has so well described in the following passage: \"In the first ages of the world, the seeming incoherence of the appearances of nature so confounded mankind, that they despaired of discovering in her operations any regular system. Their gods, though they were apprehended to interpose upon some particular occasions, were so far from being regarded as the creators of the world, that their origin was apprehended to be posterior to that of the world. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> (according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESIOD\">Hesiod</a>) was the first production of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a>. The heavens arose out of the earth, and from both together, all the gods who afterwards inhabited them. Nor was this notion confined to the vulgar, and to those poets who seem to have recorded the vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>. The same notion of the spontaneous origin of the world was embraced (as Aristotle tells us) by the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>... Mind, and understanding, and consequently Deity, being the most perfect, were necessarily, according to them, the last productions of nature. For, in all other things, what was most perfect, they observed, always came last: As in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals, it is not the seed that is most perfect, but the complete animal, with all its members in the one; and the complete plant, with all its branches, leaves, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, in the other.\"\u2014Smith's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">Post</a>.

But it is painful to contemplate these sad aberrations of human reason; nor would I have dwelt on them so long as I have done, had I not been anxious to convey to my readers a general, but I trust not unfaithful, idea of the style and spirit of a philosophy, which, within the short period of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, rose, flourished, and fell; and which, in every stage of its history, furnished employment to the talents of some of the most learned and able of our contemporaries.\n\nThe space which I have allotted to Kant has so far exceeded what I intended he should occupy, that I must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over the names of many of his countrymen much more worthy of public attention. In the account given by Degerando of the opponents to the Kantian system, some remarks are quoted from different writers, which convey a very favourable idea of the works from which they are borrowed. Among these I would more particularly distinguish those ascribed to Jacobi and to Reinhold. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, too, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Academy, where (as Degerando justly observes) the philosophy of Locke found an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a>, while banished from the rest of Germany, there is a considerable number of metaphysical articles of the highest merit. Nor must I omit to mention the con-\n\n1 \"Aussi les Allemands m\u00ealent ils trop souvent la M\u00e9taphysique \u00e0 la Po\u00e9sie.\" (Allemagne, Vol. III. p. 133.) \"Nothing (says Mr Hume) is more dangerous to reason than the flights of imagination, and nothing has been the occasion of more mistakes among philosophers. Men of bright fancies may, in this respect, be compared to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, whom the scripture represents as covering their eyes with their wings.\" (Treatise of Human Nature, Vol. I. p. 464.)\n\n2 According to a French writer, who appears to have resided many years in Germany, and who has enlivened a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Elements of Philosophy with many curious historical details concerning Kant and his successors,\u2014both Fichte and Schelling owed much of their reputation to the uncommon eloquence displayed in their academical lectures: \"Cette doctrine sortait de la bouche de Fichte, rev\u00eatue de ces ornements qui donnent la jeunesse, la beaut\u00e9 et la force au discours. On ne se lassait point en l'\u00e9coulant.\"\n\nOf Schelling he expresses himself thus: \"Schelling, appel\u00e9 \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Wirzbourg, y attira par sa r\u00e9putation un concours nombreux d'auditeurs, qu'il encha\u00eenait \u00e0 ses le\u00e7ons par la richesse de sa diction et par l'\u00e9tendue de ses connaissances. De l\u00e0, il est venu \u00e0 Munich, o\u00f9 je le revis en 1813. On dit qu'il a embrass\u00e9 la religion Catholique.\" (Essai sur les \u00c9l\u00e9ments de la Philosophie, par G. Gley, Principal au College d'Alen\u00e7on. Paris, 1817. pp. 152, 138.)\n\n3 In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of this collection (for the year 1797), which happens to be now lying before me, there\ntributions to this science by the university of Goettingen; more especially on questions connected with the philosophy of language. I have great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, also, in acknowledging the entertainment I have received, and the lights I have borrowed from the learned labours of Meiners and of Herder; but none of these are so closely connected with the history of metaphysics as to justify me in entering into particular details with respect to them. I am ashamed to say that, in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, the only one of these names which has been much talked of is that of Kant, a circumstance which, I trust, will apologize for the length to which the foregoing observations have extended.\n\nThe only other country of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> from which any contributions to metaphysical philosophy could be reasonably looked for, during the eighteenth century, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and to this particular branch of science I do not know that any Italian of much celebrity has, in these later times, turned his attention. The metaphysical works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Gerdil (a native of Savoy) are extolled by some French writers; but none of them have ever happened to fall in my way. At a more recent period, Genovesi, a Neapolitan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> (best known as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> economist), has attracted a good deal of notice by some metaphysical publications. Their chief object is said to be to reconcile, as far as possible, the opinions of Leibnitz with those of Locke. \"Pendant que Condillac donnait inutilement\n\nare three profound and important Memoirs on Probabilities, by M. Prevost and M. l'Huillier. Neither of these authors, I am aware, is of German origin, but as the Academy of Berlin has had the merit to bring their papers before the public, I could not omit this opportunity of recommending them to the attention of my readers. To a very important observation made by MM. Prevost and l'Huillier, which has been the subject of some dispute, I am happy to avail myself of the same opportunity to express my unqualified assent. (See pp. 15 and 31 of the memoirs belonging to the Classe de Philosophie Sp\u00e9culative.)\n\n1 See Note (GG.)\n2 His two first publications, which were directed against the philosophy of Locke (if we may judge from their titles), are not likely, in the present times, to excite any curiosity. 1. The Immateriality of the Soul Demonstrated against Mr Locke, on the same Principles on which this Philosopher has Demonstrated the Existence and the Immateriality of God. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>, 1747. 2. Defence of the Opinion of Malebranche, on the Nature and Origin of our Ideas, against the Examination of Mr Locke. Turin, 1748. The only other works of Gerdil which I have seen referred to are, A Dissertation on the Incompatibility of the Principles of Descartes with those of Spinoza; and A Refutation of some Principles maintained in the Emile of Rousseau.\n\nOf this last performance, Rousseau is reported to have said, \"Voila l'unique \u00e9crit publi\u00e9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONTRE\">contre</a> moi que j'aie trouv\u00e9 digne d'\u00eatre lu en entier.\" (Nouveau Dict. Hist. article Gerdil.) In the same article, a reference is made to a public discourse of the celebrated M. Mairan, of the Academy of Sciences, in which he pronounces the following judgment on Gerdil's metaphysical powers: \"Gerdil porte avec lui dans tous ces discours un esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, qui manque trop souvent aux g\u00e9om\u00e8tres m\u00eames.\"\n\n3 Born 1712, died 1769.\ndes le\u00e7ons \u00e0 un <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> d\u2019Italie, Genovesi en donnait avec plus de succ\u00e8s \u00e0 ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves Napolitans : il combinait le mieux qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait possible les th\u00e9ories de Leibnitz, pour lequel il eut toujours une pr\u00e9vention favorable, avec celle de Locke, qu\u2019il accr\u00e9dita le premier en Italie.\u201d\n\nVarious other works of greater or less celebrity, from Italian authors, seem to announce a growing taste in that part of Europe for these abstract researches. The names of Francisco Soave, of Biagioli, and of Mariano Gigli, are advantageously mentioned by their countrymen; but none of their works, as far as I can learn, have yet reached Scotland. Indeed, with the single exception of Boscovich, I recollect no writer on the other side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, whose metaphysical speculations have been heard of in this island. This is the more to be regretted, as the specimens he has given, both of originality and soundness in some of his abstract discussions, convey a very favourable idea of the schools in which he received his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. The authority to which he seems most inclined to lean is that of Leibnitz; but, on all important questions he exercises his own judgment, and often combats Leibnitz with equal freedom and success. Remarkable instances of this occur in his strictures on the principle of the sufficient reason, and in the limitations with which he has admitted the law of continuity.\n\nThe vigour, and, at the same time, the versatility of talents, displayed in the voluminous works of this extraordinary man, reflect the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> on the country which gave\n\n---\n\n1 Revue Encyclop\u00e9dique, ou Analyse Raisonn\u00e9e des Productions les plus Remarquables dans la Litt\u00e9rature, les Sciences, et les Arts.

Sarpi, an Italian by birth, who, after having distinguished himself by various publications in his own country, has now (if I am not mistaken) fixed his residence at Paris. In his own philosophical opinions, he seems to be a follower of Condillac\u2019s school, otherwise he would scarcely have spoken so highly as he has done of the French Ideologists: \u201cL\u2019Id\u00e9ologie qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9nomination r\u00e9cente pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme sp\u00e9cialement due aux Fran\u00e7ais, mais qui est aussi ancienne que la philosophie, puisqu\u2019elle a pour objet la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des id\u00e9es et l\u2019analyse des facult\u00e9s qui concourent \u00e0 leur formation, n\u2019est pas \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux Italiens, comme on pourrait le croire.\u201d)\n\nGenovesi is considered, by an historian of high reputation, as the reformer of Italian philosophy. If the execution of his Treatise on Logic corresponds at all to the enlightened views with which the design seems to have been conceived, it cannot fail to be a work of much practical utility. \u201cMa chi pu\u00f2 veramente dirsi il riformatore dell\u2019Italiana filosofia, chi la fece tosto conoscere, e rispettare da\u2019 pi\u00f9 dotti filosofi delle altre nazioni, chi seppe arricchire di nuovi pregi la logica, la metafisica, e la morale, fu il celebre Genovesi.

Venezia, 1800.)\nhim birth, and would almost tempt one to give credit to the theory which ascribes to the genial climates of the south a beneficial influence on the intellectual frame. Italy is certainly the only part of Europe where mathematicians and metaphysicians of the highest rank have produced such poetry as has proceeded from the pens of Boscovich and Stay. It is in this rare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of imagination, and of the reasoning powers, that the perfection of the human intellect will be allowed to consist; and of this balance a far greater number of instances may be quoted from Italy (reckoning from Galileo\\(^1\\) downwards), than in any other corner of the learned world.\n\nThe sciences of ethics, and of political economy, seem to be more suited to the taste of the modern Italians, than logic or metaphysics, properly so called. And in the two former branches of knowledge, they have certainly contributed much to the instruction and improvement of the eighteenth century. But on these subjects we are not yet prepared to enter.\n\nIn the New World, the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> and of manners has not hitherto been so favourable to abstract science as to pursuits which come home directly to the business of human life. There is, however, one metaphysician of whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> has to boast, who, in logical acuteness and subtilty, does not yield to any disputant bred in the universities of Europe. I need not say, that I allude to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JONATHAN\">Jonathan</a> Edwards. But, at the time when he wrote, the state of America was more favourable than it now is, or can for a long period be expected to be, to such inquiries as those which engaged his attention; inquiries (by the way) to which his thoughts were evidently turned, less by the impulse of speculative curiosity, than by his anxiety to defend the theological system in which he had been educated, and to which he was most conscientiously and zealously attached. The effect of this anxiety in sharpening his faculties, and in keeping his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> vigilance constantly on the alert, may be traced in every step of his argument.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See a most interesting account of Galileo's taste for poetry and polite literature in Ginguen\u00e9, *Histoire Litt\u00e9raire d'Italie*. Tome V. pp. 331, et seq. \u00e0 Paris, 1812.\n\n\\(^2\\) While this Dissertation was in the press, I received a new American publication, entitled, \"Transactions of the Historical and Literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the American Philosophical Society, held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, for Promoting Useful Knowledge,\" Vol. I. (Philadelphia, 1819.) From an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a> prefixed to this volume, it appears that, at a meeting of this learned body in 1815, it was resolved, \"That a new committee be added to those already established, to be denominated the Committee of History, Moral Science, and General Literature.\" It was with great pleasure I observed, that one of the first objects to which the committee has directed its attention is to investigate and ascertain, as much as possible, the structure and grammatical forms of the languages of the aboriginal nations of America. The Report of the corresponding secretary (M. Duponceau), dated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1819, with respect to the progress then made in this investigation, is highly curious and interesting, and displays not only enlarged and philosophical views, but an\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, a new and unexpected mine of intellectual wealth has been opened to the learned of Europe, in those regions of the East, which, although in all probability the cradle of civilization and science, were, till very lately, better known in the annals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> than of philosophy. The metaphysical and ethical remains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> sages are, in a peculiar degree, interesting and instructive; inasmuch as they seem to have furnished the germs of the chief systems taught in the Grecian schools. The favourite theories, however, of the Hindoos will, all of them, be found, more or less, tinctured with those ascetic habits of abstract and mystical meditation which seem to have been, in all ages, congenial to their constitutional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>. Of such habits, an Idealism, approaching to that of Berkeley and Malebranche, is as natural an offspring, as Materialism is of the gay and dissipated manners, which, in great and luxurious capitals, are constantly inviting the thoughts abroad.\n\nTo these remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> science in the East, the attention of Europe was first called by Bernier, a most intelligent and authentic traveller, of whom I formerly took notice as a favourite pupil of Gassendi. But it is chiefly by our own countrymen that the field which he opened has been subsequently explored; and of their meritorious labours in the prosecution of this task, during the reign of our late Sovereign, it is scarcely possible to form too high an estimate.\n\nMuch more, however, may be yet expected, if such a prodigy as Sir William Jones should again appear, uniting, in as miraculous a degree, the gift of tongues with the spirit of philosophy. The structure of the Sanscrit, in itself, independently of the treasures locked up in it, affords one of the most puzzling subjects of inquiry that was ever presented to human ingenuity. The affinities and filiations of different tongues, as evinced\n\nintimate acquaintance with the philological researches of Adelung, Vater, Humboldt, and other German scholars. All this evinces an enlightened curiosity, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of literary information, which could scarcely have been expected in these rising states for many years to come.\n\nThe rapid progress which the Americans have lately made in the art of writing has been remarked by various critics, and it is certainly a very important fact in the history of their literature. Their state papers were, indeed, always distinguished by a strain of animated and vigorous eloquence; but as most of them were composed on the spur of the occasion, their authors had little time to bestow on the niceties, or even upon the purity of diction. An attention to these is the slow offspring of learned leisure, and of the diligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the best models. This I presume was Gray's meaning, when he said, that \"good writing not only required great parts, but the very best of those parts;\" a maxim which, if true, would point out the state of the public taste with respect to style, as the surest test among any people of the general improvement which their intellectual powers have received; and which, when applied to our Trans-atlantic brethren, would justify sanguine expectations of the attainments of the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>.\n\n* Note of Mason on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> of Gray's to Dr Wharton, on the death of Dr Middleton.\nin their corresponding roots and other coincidences, are abundantly curious, but incomparably more easy in the explanation, than the systematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> which is said to exist between the Sanscrit and the Greek (and also between the Sanscrit and the Latin, which is considered as the most ancient dialect of the Greek), in the conjugations and flexions of their verbs, and in many other particulars of their mechanism; an analogy which is represented as so complete, that, in the versions which have been made from the one language into the other, \"Sanscrit,\" we are told, \"answers to Greek, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> to face in a glass.\"! That the Sanscrit did not grow up to the perfection which it now exhibits, from popular and casual modes of speech, the unexampled regularity of its forms seems almost to demonstrate; and yet, should this supposition be rejected, to what other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> shall we have recourse, which does not involve equal, if not greater improbabilities? The problem is well worthy of the attention of philosophical grammarians; and the solution of it, whatever it may be, can scarcely fail to throw some new lights on the history of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, as well as on that of the human mind.","sp":162,"ep":184},{"h":"NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> (A.) p. 10.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, as a circumstance which throws considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Scotland during the latter half of the eighteenth century, that, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> immemorial, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> intercourse had been kept up between Scotland and the Continent.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> was nearly the same in the profession of physic; and, even among the Scottish clergy, I have conversed, in my youth, with some old men who had studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> or in Germany. Of our smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> gentlemen, resident on their own estates (an order of men which, from various causes, has now, alas! totally vanished), there was scarcely one who had not enjoyed the benefit of a university education; and very few of those who could afford the expense of foreign travel, who had not visited France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Monboddo somewhere mentions, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of his father, that he sold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his estate to enable himself (his eldest son) to pursue his studies at the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRONINGEN\">Groningen</a>.

In the mathematical sciences, where the graces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, Scotland, in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its inhabitants, was never, from the time of Neper, left behind by any country in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; nor ought it to be forgotten, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of Newton was publicly taught by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Gregory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> and by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> James Gregory at St Andrews, before it was able to supplant the vortices of Descartes in that very university of which Newton was a member.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 For this we have the authority of Whiston, the immediate successor of Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton in the Lucasian Professorship at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; and of Dr Reid, who was a nephew of the two Gregorys. \"Mr Gregory had already caused several of his scholars to keep Acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian Philosophy</a>; while we at Cambridge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Cartesians.\" (Whiston's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a>.)\n\n\"I have by me\" (says Dr Reid) \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESIS\">Thesis</a> printed at Edinburgh, 1690, by James Gregory, who was at that time Professor of Philosophy at St Andrews, containing twenty-five positions; the first three relating to logic, and the abuse of it in the Aristotelian and Cartesian philosophy. The remaining twenty-two positions are a compend of Newton's Principia. This Thesis, as was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> at that time in the Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">Universities</a>, was to be defended in a public disputation, by the candidates, previous to their taking their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>.\"\u2014(Hutton's Mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>.\u2014Supplement by Dr Reid to the article Gregory.\nThe case was similar in every other liberal pursuit, where an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the delicacies of the English tongue was not an insuperable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to distinction. Even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of eloquence, as far as it was attainable in their own vernacular idiom, some of the Scottish pleaders, about the era when the two kingdoms were united, seem ambitiously, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to have formed themselves upon models, which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, it has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> supposed to be more safe to admire than to imitate.

At present, I shall only observe, that it was in the Scottish universities that the philosophy of Locke, as well as that of Newton, was first adopted as a branch of academical education.\n\nNote (B.) p. 14.\n\nExtract of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from M. Allamand to Mr Gibbon. (See Gibbon's Miscellaneous Works.)\n\n\"Vous avez sans doute raison de dire que les <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> \u00e9videntes dont il s'agit, ne sont pas de simples id\u00e9es, mais des jugemens. Mais ayez aussi la complaisance de reconno\u00eetre que M. Locke les alleguant en exemple d'id\u00e9es qui passent pour inn\u00e9es, et qui ne le sont pas selon lui, s'il y a ici de la m\u00e9prise, c'est lui qu'il faut relever l\u00e0-dessus, et non pas moi, qui n'avais autre chose \u00e0 faire qu'\u00e0 refuter sa mani\u00e8re de raisonner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONTRE\">contre</a> l'inn\u00e9it\u00e9 de ces id\u00e9es ou jugemens l\u00e0. D'ailleurs, Monsieur, vous remarquerez, s'il vous pla\u00eet, que dans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> dispute il s'agit en effet, de savoir si certaines v\u00e9rit\u00e9s \u00e9videntes et communes, et non pas seulement certaines id\u00e9es simples, sont inn\u00e9es ou non. Ceux qui affirment, ne donnent gu\u00e8re pour exemple d'id\u00e9es simples qui le soient, que celles de Dieu, de l'unit\u00e9, et de l'existence; les autres exemples sont pris de propositions completes, que vous appelez jugemens.\n\n\"Mais, dites vous, y aura-t-il donc des jugemens inn\u00e9s? Le jugement est il autre chose qu'un acte de nos facult\u00e9s intellectuelles dans la comparaison des id\u00e9es? Le jugement sur les v\u00e9rit\u00e9s \u00e9videntes, n'est il pas une simple vue de ces v\u00e9rit\u00e9s l\u00e0, un simple coup d'\u0153il que l'esprit jette sur elles? J'accorde tout cela. Et de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, qu'est ce qu' id\u00e9e? N'est ce pas vue, ou coup d'\u0153il, si vous voulez? Ceux qui d\u00e9nissent l'id\u00e9e autrement, ne s'\u00e9loignent-ils pas visiblement du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENS\">sens</a> et de l'intention du mot? Dire que les id\u00e9es sont les esp\u00e8ces des choses imprim\u00e9es dans l'esprit, comme l'image de l'objet sensible est trac\u00e9e dans l'\u0153il, n'est ce pas jargonner plut\u00f4t que d\u00e9finir? Or c'est la faute, qu'on fait tous les metaphysiciens, et quoique M. Locke l'ait bien sentie, il a mieux aim\u00e9 se facher contre eux, et tirer contre les girouettes de la place, que s'appliquer \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00ealer ce galimatias. Que n'a-t-il dit, non seulement il n'y a point d'id\u00e9es inn\u00e9es dans le sens de ces Messieurs; mais il n'y a point d'id\u00e9es du tout dans ce sens l\u00e0; toute id\u00e9e est un acte, une vue, un coup d'\u0153il de l'esprit. D\u00e8s-lors demander s'il y a des id\u00e9es inn\u00e9es, c'est demander s'il y a certaines v\u00e9rit\u00e9s si \u00e9videntes et si communes que tout esprit non stupide puisse naturellement, sans culture et sans ma\u00eetre, sans discussion, sans raisonnement, les <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECONNOITRE\">reconnoitre</a> d'un coup d'\u0153il, et souvent m\u00eame sans s'apercevoir qu'on jette ce coup d'\u0153il. L'affirmative me paroit incontestable, et selon moi, la question est vid\u00e9e par l\u00e0.\n\nSee a splendid eulogium in the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, by Sir George Mackenzie, on the most distinguished pleaders of his time at the Scottish bar. Every allowance being made for the flattering touches of a friendly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, his portraits can scarcely be supposed not to have borne a strong and characteristic resemblance to the originals from which they were copied.\n\"Maintenant prenez garde, Monsieur, que cette mani\u00e8re d'entendre l'affaire, va au but des partisans des id\u00e9es inn\u00e9es, tout comme la leur ; et par la m\u00eame contredit M. Locke dans le sien. Car pourquoi voudroit on qu'il y a eu des id\u00e9es inn\u00e9es ? C'est pour en opposer la certitude et l'\u00e9vidence au doute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> des sceptiques, qui est ruin\u00e9 d'un seul coup, s'il y a des v\u00e9rit\u00e9s dont la vue soit n\u00e9cessaire et naturelle \u00e0 l'homme. Or vous sentez, Monsieur, que je puis leur dire cela dans ma fa\u00e7on d'expliquer la chose, tout aussi bien que les partisans ordinaires des id\u00e9es inn\u00e9es dans la leur. Et voil\u00e0 ce que semble incommodeur un peu M. Locke, qui, sans se d\u00e9clarer Pyrrhonien, laisse appercevoir un peu trop de foible pour le Pyrrhonisme, et a beaucoup contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 le nourrir dans ce si\u00e8cle. A force de vouloir marquer les bornes de nos connaissances, ce qui \u00e9toit fort n\u00e9cessaire, il a quelquefois tout mis en bornes.\"\n\nNote (C.) p. 15.\n\n\"A decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this is afforded by the allusions to Locke's doctrines in the dramatic pieces then in possession of the French stage,\" &c.\n\nIn a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> of Destouches (entitled La Fausse Agnes), which must have been written long before the period in question, \"the heroine, a lively and accomplished girl, supposed to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> arrived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> at her father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in Poitou, is introduced as first assuming the appearance of imbecility, in order to get rid of a disagreeable lover; and, afterwards, as pleading her own cause in a mock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> before an absurd old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> and two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> ladies, to convince them that she is in reality not out of her senses. In the course of her argument on this subject, she endeavours to astonish her judges by an ironical display of her philosophical knowledge; warning them of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulty and nicety of the question upon which they were about to pronounce. \"Vous voulez juger de moi ! mais, pour juger sainement, il faut une grande \u00e9tendue de connaissance; encore est-il bien douteux qu'il y en ait de certaines. . . . . . Avant donc que vous entrepreniez de prononcer sur mon sujet, je demande pr\u00e9alablement que vous examiniez avec moi nos connaissances en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les degr\u00e9s de ces connaissances, leur \u00e9tendue, leur r\u00e9alit\u00e9; que nous convenions de ce que c'est que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et si la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 se trouve effectivement. Apr\u00e8s quoi nous traiterons des propositions universelles, des maximes, des propositions frivoles, et de la foibless\u00e9, ou de la solidit\u00e9 de nos lumi\u00e8res. . . . . .

Pour moi, j'ai longtemps examin\u00e9 ce sentiment, et j'entreprends de le combattre, de le refuter, de l'aneantir, si vous avez la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> de m'\u00e9couter.\" I have transcribed but a part of this curious pleading; but I presume more than enough to show, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, and almost every word of it, refers to Locke's doctrines. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and third sentences, the titles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> chapters in the fourth book of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> are exactly copied. It was impossible that such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> should have produced the slightest comic effect, unless the book alluded to had been in very general circulation among the higher orders; I might perhaps add, in much\n\n---\n\nThis little piece was first published in 1757, three years after the author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which took place in 1754, in the seventy-fourth year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. But we are told by D'Alembert, that from the age of sixty, he had renounced, from sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, all thoughts of writing for the stage. (Eloge de Destouches.) This carries the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of all his dramatic works, at least as far back as 1740. As for Destouches' own familiarity with the writings of Locke, it is easily accounted for by his residence in England from 1717 to 1723, where he remained, for some time after the departure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Dubois, as Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. Voltaire did not visit England till 1727.\nmore general circulation than it ever obtained among that class of readers in England. At no period, certainly, since it was first published (such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of national manners), could similar allusions have been made to it, or to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> a subject, with the slightest hope of success on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> stage. And yet D'Alembert pronounces La Fausse Agnes to be a piece, pleine de mouvement et de gaiet\u00e9.\n\nNote (D.) p. 18.\n\n\"Descartes asserted\" (says a very zealous Lockist, M. de Voltaire), \"that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, at its coming into the body, is informed with the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of metaphysical notions; knowing God, infinite space, possessing all abstract <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>; in a word, completely endued with the most sublime lights, which it unhappily forgets at its issuing from the womb.\n\n\"With regard to myself\" (continues the same writer), \"I am as little inclined as Locke could be, to fancy that, some weeks after I was conceived, I was a very learned soul; knowing at that time a thousand things which I forgot at my birth; and possessing, when in the womb (though to no manner of purpose), knowledge which I lost the instant I had occasion for it; and which I have never since been able to recover perfectly.\"\u2014Letters Concerning the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">Nation</a>. Letter 13.\n\nWhatever inferences may be deducible from some of Descartes's expressions, or from the comments on these expressions by some who assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Cartesians, I never can persuade myself, that the system of innate ideas, as conceived and adopted by him, was meant to give any sanction to the absurdities here treated by Voltaire with such just contempt. In no part of Descartes's works, as far as I have been able to discover, is the slightest ground given for this extraordinary account of his opinions. Nor was Descartes the first person who introduced this language. Long before the date of his works, it was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in England; and is to be found in a Poem of Sir John Davis, published four years before Descartes was born. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. XXVI. of The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">Immortality</a> of the Soul.) The title of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> expressly asserts, That there are innate ideas in the soul.\n\nIn one of Descartes's letters, he enters into some explanations with respect to this part of his philosophy, which he complains had been very grossly misunderstood or misrepresented. To the following passage I have no doubt that Locke himself would have subscribed. It strikes myself as so very remarkable, that, in order to attract to it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of my readers, I shall submit it to their consideration in an English translation.\n\n\"When I said that the idea of God is innate in us, I never meant more than this, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has endowed us with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> by which we may know God; but I have never either said or thought, that such ideas had an actual existence, or even that they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> distinct from the faculty of thinking. I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> even go farther, and assert that nobody has kept at a greater distance than myself from all this trash of scholastic entities, insomuch that I could not help smiling when I read the numerous arguments which Regius has so industriously collected to show that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> have no actual knowledge of God while they remain in the womb. Although the idea of God is so imprinted on our minds, that every person has within himself the faculty of knowing him, it does not follow that there may not have been various individuals who have passed through life without ever making this idea a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, they who think they have an idea of a plurality of Gods, have no idea of God whatsoever.\" (Cartesii, Epist. Pars I. Epist. xcix.)\n\nAfter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> this passage from Descartes, may I request of my readers to look back to the ex-\ntracts in the beginning of this note, from Voltaire's letters? A remark of Montesquieu, occasioned by some strictures hazarded by this lively but very superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> on the *Spirit of Laws*, is more peculiarly applicable to him when he ventures to pronounce judgment on metaphysical writers: \"Quant \u00e0 Voltaire, il a trop d'esprit pour m'entendre; tous les livres qu'il lit, il les fait, apr\u00e8s quoi il approuve ou critique ce qu'il a fait.\" (*Lettre \u00e0 M. l'Abb\u00e9 de Guasco.*)\n\nThe remark is applicable to other critics as well as to Voltaire.\n\nThe prevailing misapprehensions with respect to this, and some other principles of the Cartesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, can only be accounted for by supposing, that the opinions of Descartes have been more frequently judged of from the glosses of his followers, than from his own works. It seems to have never been sufficiently known to his adversaries, either in France or in England, that, after his philosophy had become fashionable in Holland, a number of Dutch divines, whose opinions differed very widely from his, found it convenient to shelter their own errors under his established name; and that some of them went so far as to avail themselves of his authority in propagating tenets directly opposite to his declared sentiments. Hence a distinction of the Cartesians into the genuine and the pseudo-Cartesians; and hence an inconsistency in their representations of the metaphysical ideas of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, which can only be cleared up by a reference (seldom thought of) to his own very concise and perspicuous text. (*Fabricii Bib. Gr. lib. iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. vi. p. 183.* Heinecc. *El. Hist. Phil. \u00a7 cx.*)\n\nMany of the objections commonly urged against the innate ideas of Descartes are much more applicable to the innate ideas of Leibnitz, whose language concerning them is infinitely more hypothetical and unphilosophical; and sometimes approaches nearly to the enthusiastic theology of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and of Cudworth. Nothing in the works of Descartes bears any resemblance, in point of extravagance, to what follows: \"Pulcherrima multa sunt Platonis dogmata, . . . . . . esse in divina mente mundum intelligibilem, quem ego quoque vocare soleo regionem idearum; objectum sapientiae esse . . . . . . substantias nempe simplices, quae a me monades appellantur, et semel existentes semper persistant, . . . . . . id est Deum et Animas, et harum potissimas mentes, producta a Deo simulacra divinitatis. . . . . Porro qu\u00e6vis mens, ut recte <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOTINUS\">Plotinus</a>, quendam in se mandum intelligibilem continet, ino mea sententia et hunc ipsum sensibilem sibi representat. . . . . Sunt in nobis semina corum, qu\u00e6 discimus, ide\u00e6 nempe, et qu\u00e6 inde nascuntur, \u00e6tern\u00e6 veritates . . . . Longe ergo preferend\u00e6 sunt Platonis notitia innata, quas reminiscentia nomine velavit, tabulae rase Aristotelis et Lockii, aliorumque recentiorum, qui . . . . . . philosophantur.\" (*Leib. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, Tom. II. p. 223.*)\n\nWild and visionary, however, as the foregoing propositions are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the names of Gassendi and of Hobbes had been substituted instead of those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and of Locke, I should have been disposed to subscribe implicitly to the judgment pronounced in the concluding sentence. The metaphysics of Plato, along with a considerable alloy of poetical fiction, has at least the merit of containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> admixture of important and of ennobling truth; while that of Gassendi and of Hobbes, beside its inconsistency with facts attested, every moment, by our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>, tends directly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> the rational faculties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> with the instincts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>.\n\nIn the *Acta Eruditorum* for the year 1684, Leibnitz observes, that \"in the case of things which we have never thought of, the innate ideas in our minds may be compared to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of marble.\" This seems to me to prove, that the difference between him and Locke was rather in appearance than in reality; and that, although he called those ideas innate which Locke was at pains to trace to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> or to reflection, he would have readily granted, that our first knowledge of their existence was co\u00ebval with the first impressions made on our senses by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects. That this was also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Descartes is still more evident; notwithstanding the ludicrous point of view in which Voltaire has attempted to exhibit this part of his system.\nMr Locke seems to have considered this use of the word *reflection* as peculiar to himself; but it is perfectly analogous to the *\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2* of the Greek philosophers, and to various expressions which occur in the works of John Smith of Cambridge, and of Dr Cudworth. We find it in a *Poem on the Immortality of the Soul*, by Sir John Davis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">Attorney-General</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, and probably it is to be met with in English publications of a still earlier date.\n\nAll things without which round about we see,\nWe seek to know, and have wherewith to do:\nBut that whereby we reason, live and be,\nWithin ourselves we strangers are thereto.\n\nIs it because the mind is like the eye,\nThro' which it gathers knowledge by degrees:\nWhose rays reflect not, but spread outwardly;\nNot seeing itself, when other things it sees?\n\nNo, doubtless; for the mind can backward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>\nUpon herself, her understanding light;\nBut she is so corrupt, and so defac'd,\nAs her own image doth herself affright.\n\nAs is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> fair,\nWhich for her lust was turn'd into a cow;\nWhen thirsty, to a stream she did repair,\nAnd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> herself transform'd, she wist not how:\n\nAt first she startles, then she stands amaz'd;\nAt last with terror she from hence doth fly,\nAnd loathes the wat'ry glass wherein she gaz'd,\nAnd shuns it still, altho' for thirst she die.\n\nFor even at first reflection she espies\nSuch strange chimeras, and such monsters there;\nSuch toys, such antics, and such vanities,\nAs she retires and shrinks for shame and fear.\n\nI have quoted these verses, chiefly because I think it not improbable that they may have suggested to Gray the following very happy allusion in his fine Fragment *De Principiis Cogitandi*:\n\nQualis Hamadryadum quondam si forte sororum\nUnus, novos peragrans salutes, et devia rura\n(Atque illam in viridi suadet procumbere ripa\nFontis pura quies, et opaci frigoris umbra);\nDum prona in latices speculi de margine pendet,\nMirata est subitam venienti occurrere Nymphae\nMox eodem, quos ipsa, artus, cadem ora gerentem\nUn\u00e0 inferre gradus, un\u00e0 succedere sylva\nAspicit alludens; seque agnoscit in undis:\nSic sensu interno rerum simulacra suarum\nMens ciet, et proprios observat conscia vultus.\nNOTE (F.) p. 37.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> attacks made in England on Locke's Essay, during his own lifetime, were by Edward Stillingfleet, Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>; John Norris,1 Rector of Bemerton; Henry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEE\">Lee</a>, B.D.; and the Reverend Mr Lowde (author of a Discourse concerning the Nature of Man). Of these four writers, the first is the only one whose objections to Locke are now at all remembered in the learned world; and for this distinction, Stillingfleet is solely indebted (I speak of him here merely as a metaphysician, for in some other departments of study, his merits are universally admitted) to the particular notice which Locke has condescended to take of him, in the Notes incorporated with the later editions of his Essay. The only circumstance which renders these Notes worthy of preservation, is the record they furnish of Locke's forbearance and courtesy, in managing a controversy carried on, upon the other side, with so much captiousness and asperity. An Irish bishop, in a letter on this subject to Mr Molyneux, writes thus: \"I read Mr Locke's letter to the Bishop of Worcester with great satisfaction, and am wholly of your opinion, that he has fairly laid the great bishop on his back, but it is with so much gentleness, as if he were afraid not only of hurting him, but even of spoiling or tumbling his clothes.\"\n\nThe work of Lee is entitled Anti-scepticism, or Notes upon each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">Chapter</a> of Mr Locke's Essay concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Understanding, with an explanation of all the particulars of which he treats, and in the same order. By Henry Lee, B.D. formerly Fellow of Emanuel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> in Cambridge, now Rector of Tichmarsh in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a>. London, 1702, in folio.\n\nThe strictures of this author, which are often acute and sometimes just, are marked throughout with a fairness and candour rarely to be met with in controversial writers. It will appear remarkable to modern critics that he lays particular stress upon the charms of Locke's style, among the other excellencies which had conspired to recommend his work to public favour. \"The celebrated author of the Essay on Human Understanding has all the advantages desirable to recommend it to the inquisitive genius of this age; an avowed pretence to new methods of discovering truth and improving learning; an unusual coherence in the several parts of his scheme; a singular clearness in his reasonings; and above all, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> elegancy of style; an unaffected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> in his expressions; a just proportion and tuneable cadence in all his periods.\" (See the Epistle Dedicatory.)\n\nNOTE (G.) p. 41.\n\nFor the information of some of my readers, it may be proper to observe, that the word influx came to be employed to denote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of body and soul on each other, in consequence of a prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which supposed that this action was carried on by something intermediate (whether material or immaterial was not positively decided) flowing from the one substance to the other. It is in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> that the word is understood by Leibnitz, when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> as an insurmountable objection to the theory of influx, that \"it is impossible to conceive either material particles or immaterial qualities to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from body to mind, or from mind to body.\"\n\nInstead of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> influx, that of influence came gradually to be substituted by our English\n\n---\n\n1 Of this person, who was a most ingenious and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> thinker, I shall have occasion afterwards to speak.\nwriters; but the two words were originally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>, and were used indiscriminately as late as\nthe time of Sir Matthew Hale. (See his Primitive Origination of Mankind.)\n\nIn Johnson's Dictionary, the primitive and radical meaning assigned to the word influence (which\nhe considers as of French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>) is \"the power of the celestial aspects operating upon terres-\ntrial bodies and affairs;\" and in the Encyclopedia of Chambers, it is defined to be \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> sup-\nposed to flow from the bodies of the stars, either with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> or light, to which astrologers\nvainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> all the events which happen on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>.\" To this astrological use of the word\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> had plainly a reference in that fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of his L'Allegro,\n\n\"It store of ladies whose bright eyes\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">Rain</a> influence.\"\n\nIt is a circumstance worthy of notice, that a word thus originating in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of astrologers\nand schoolmen, should now, in our language, be appropriated almost exclusively to politics.\n\n\"Thus\" (says Blackstone) \"are the electors of one branch of the legislature secured from any undue\ninfluence from either of the other two, and from all external violence and compulsion; but the great-\nest danger is that in which themselves co-operate by the infamous practice of bribery and corrup-\ntion.\" And again, \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> has gradually and imperceptibly gained almost as much in influence\nas it has lost in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>.\"\n\nIn all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, there will be found at bottom one common idea, the existence of some secret\nand mysterious connection between two things, of which connection it is conceived to be impossible\nor unwise to trace what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> calls the latens processus.\n\nNote (H.) p. 43.\n\nAfter these quotations from Locke, added to those which I have already produced from the same\nwork, the reader may judge of the injustice done to him by Leibnitz, in the first sentence of his\ncorrespondence with Clarke.\n\n\"It semble que la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> naturelle m\u00eame s'affoiblit extr\u00eamement. Plusieurs font les ames corpo-\nrelles; d'autres font Dieu lui-m\u00eame corporel.\n\n\"M. Locke et ses sectateurs, doutent au moins, si les ames ne sont mat\u00e9rielles, et naturellement\nperissables.\"\n\nDr Clarke, in his reply to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, admits that \"some parts of Locke's writings may justly be\nsuspected as intimating his doubts whether the soul be immaterial or no, but herein (he adds) he\nhas been followed only by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIALISTS\">Materialists</a>, enemies to the mathematical principles of philosophy;\nand who approve little or nothing in Mr Locke's writings, but his errors.\"\n\nTo those who have studied with care the whole writings of Locke, the errors here alluded to will\nappear in a very venial light when compared with the general spirit of his philosophy. Nor can I\nforbear to remark farther on this occasion, that supposing Locke's doubts concerning the immateri-\nality of the soul to have been as real as Clarke seems to have suspected, this very circumstance would\nonly reflect the greater lustre on the soundness of his logical views concerning the proper method of\nstudying the mind;\u2014in the prosecution of which study, he has adhered much more systematically\n\n1 The explanation of the word Influence, given in the Dictionary of the French Academy, accords perfectly with the tenor of the\nabove remarks. \"V\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui, suivant les Astrologues, d\u00e9coule des Astres sur les corps sublunaires.\"\nthan either Descartes or Leibnitz, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of reflection, as the sole medium for ascertaining the internal phenomena; describing, at the same time, these phenomena in the simplest and most rigorous terms which our language affords, and avoiding, in a far greater degree than any of his predecessors, any attempt to explain them by analogies borrowed from the perceptions of the external senses.\n\nI before observed, that Leibnitz greatly underrated Locke as a metaphysician. It is with regret I have now to mention, that Locke has by no means done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the splendid talents and matchless erudition of Leibnitz. In a letter to his friend Mr Molyneux, dated in 1697, he expresses himself thus: \"I see you and I agree pretty well concerning Mr Leibnitz; and this sort of fiddling makes me hardly avoid thinking, that he is not that very great man as has been talked of him.\" And in another letter, written in the same year to the same correspondent, after referring to one of Leibnitz's Memoirs in the Acta Eruditorum (De primae Philosophiae Emendatione), he adds, \"From whence I only draw this inference, that even great parts will not master any subject without great thinking, and that even the largest minds have but narrow swallows.\"\n\nLet me add, that in my quotations from English writers, I adhere scrupulously to their own phraseology, in order to bring under the eye of my readers, specimens of English composition at different periods of our history. I must request their attention to this circumstance, as some expressions in the former part of this Dissertation, which have been censured as Scotticisms, occur in Extracts from authors who, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, never visited this side of the Tweed.\n\nNote (I.) p. 51.\n\nAfter studying, with all possible diligence, what Leibnitz has said of his monads in different parts of his works, I find myself quite incompetent to annex any precise idea to the word as he has employed it. I shall, therefore, aim at nothing more in this note, but to collect, into as small a compass as I can, some of his most intelligible attempts to explain its meaning.\n\n\"A substance is a thing capable of action. It is simple or compounded. A simple substance is that which has no parts. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> substance is an aggregate of simple substances or of monads.\n\n\"Compounded substances, or bodies, are multitudes. Simple substances, lives, souls, spirits, are units. Such simple substances must exist everywhere; for without simple substances there could be no compounded ones. All nature therefore is full of life.\" (Tom. II. p. 32.)\n\n\"Monads, having no parts, are neither extended, figured, nor divisible. They are the real atoms of nature, or, in other words, the elements of things.\" (Tom. II. p. 20.)\n\n(It must not, however, be imagined, that the monads of Leibnitz have any resemblance to what are commonly called atoms by philosophers. On the contrary, he says expressly, that \"monads are not atoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, but atoms of substances;\"\u2014real units, which are the first principles in the composition of things, and the last elements in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of substances;\u2014of which principles or elements, what we call bodies are only the phenomena.\")\u2014(Tom. II. pp. 53, 325.)\n\nIn another passage we are told, that \"a monad is not a material but a formal atom, it being impossible for a thing to be at once material, and possessed of a real unity and indivisibility. It is necessary, therefore\" (says Leibnitz), \"to revive the obsolete doctrine of substantial forms (the essence\n\n---\n\n1 \"Les substances simples, les vies, les ames, les esprits, sont des unit\u00e9s.\"\nof which consists in force), separating it, however, from the various abuses to which it is liable.\"\n\n\u2014(Ibid. p. 50.)\n\n\"Every monad is a living mirror, representing the universe, according to its particular point of view, and subject to as regular laws as the universe itself.\"\n\n\"Every monad, with a particular body, makes a living substance.\"\n\n\"The knowledge of every soul (ame) extends to infinity, and to all things; but this knowledge is confused. As a person walking on the margin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and listening to its roar, hears the noise of each individual wave of which the whole noise is made up, but without being able to distinguish one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> from another, in like manner, our confused perceptions are the result of the impressions made upon us by the whole universe. The case (he adds) is the same with each monad.\"\n\n\"As for the reasonable soul or mind (l'esprit), there is something in it more than in the monads, or even than in those souls which are simple. It is not only a mirror of the universe of created things, but an image of the Deity. Such minds are capable of reflected acts, and of conceiving what is meant by the words I, substance, monad, soul, mind; in a word, of conceiving things and truths unconnected with matter; and it is this which renders us capable of science and of demonstrative reasoning.\n\n\"What becomes of these souls or forms, on the death of the animal? There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> (replies Leibnitz) but to conclude, that not only the soul is preserved, but that the animal also with its organical machine continues to exist, although the destruction of its grosser parts has reduced it to a smallness as invisible to our eyes as it was before the moment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. Thus neither animals nor souls perish at death; nor is there such a thing as death, if that word be understood with rigorous and metaphysical accuracy. The soul never quits completely the body with which it is united, nor does it pass from one body into another with which it had no connection before; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAMORPHOSIS\">metamorphosis</a> takes place, but there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEMPSYCHOSIS\">metempsychosis</a>.\" \u2014(Tom. II. pp. 51, 52.)\n\nOn this part of the Leibnitzian system, D'Alembert remarks, that it proves nothing more than that the author had perceived better than any of his predecessors, the impossibility of forming a distinct idea of the nature of matter; a subject, however (D'Alembert adds), on which the theory of the monads does not seem calculated to throw much light. I would rather say (without altogether denying the justness of D'Alembert's criticism), that this theory took its rise from the author's vain desire to explain the nature of forces; in consequence of which he suffers himself perpetually to be led astray from those sensible effects which are exclusively the proper objects of physics, into conjectures concerning their efficient causes, which are altogether placed beyond the reach of our research.\n\nNote (K.) p. 55.\n\nThe metaphysical argument advanced by the Leibnitzians in proof of the law of continuity has never appeared to me to be satisfactory. \"If a body at rest (it has been said) begins, per saltum, to move with any finite velocity, then this body must be at the same indivisible instant in two different states, that of rest and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which is impossible.\"\n\n1 \"Si toto tempore (says Father Boscovich, speaking of the Law of Continuity in the Collision of Bodies) ante contactum subsequentis corporis superficies antecedens habuit 12 gradus velocitatis, et sequenti 9, salu facto momentaneo ipso initio contactus; in\nAs this reasoning, though it relates to a physical fact, is itself wholly of a metaphysical nature; and as the inference deduced from it has been generalized into a law, supposed to extend to all the various branches of human knowledge, it is not altogether foreign to our present subject briefly to consider how far it is demonstratively conclusive, in this simplest of all its possible applications.\n\nOn the above argument, then, I would remark, 1. That the ideas both of rest and of motion, as well as the more general idea conveyed by the word state, all of them necessarily involve the idea of time or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; and, consequently, a body cannot be said to be in a state either of rest or of motion, at an indivisible instant. Whether the body be supposed (as in the case of motion) to change its place from one instant to another; or to continue (as in that of rest) for an instant in the same place, the idea of some finite portion of time will, on the slightest reflection, be found to enter as an essential element into our conception of the physical fact.\n\n2. Although it certainly would imply a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to suppose a body to be in two different states at the same instant, there does not appear to be any inconsistency in asserting that an indivisible instant may form the limit between a state of rest and a state of motion. Suppose one half of this page to be painted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, it might, I apprehend, be said with the most rigorous propriety, that the transition from the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to the other was made per saltum; nor do I think it would be regarded as a valid objection to this phraseology, to represent it as one of its implied consequences, that the mathematical line which forms their common limit, must at once be both black and white. It seems to me quite impossible to elude the force of this reasoning, without having recourse to the existence of something intermediate between rest and motion, which does not partake of the nature of either.\n\nIs it conceivable that a body can exist in any state which does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under one or other of the two predicaments, rest or motion? If this question should be answered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, will it not follow that the transition from one of these states to the other must, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, be made per saltum, and must consequently violate the supposed law of continuity? Indeed, if such a law existed, how could a body at rest begin to move, or a body in motion come to a state of rest?\n\nBut farther, when it is said that \"it is impossible for a body to have its state changed from motion to rest, or from rest to motion, without passing through all the intermediate degrees of velocity,\" what are we to understand by the intermediate degrees of velocity between rest and motion? Is not every velocity, how small soever, a finite velocity; and does it not differ as essentially from a state of rest, as the velocity of light?\n\nIt is observed by Mr Playfair (Second Dissertation, Part I. p. 70), that Galileo was the first who maintained the existence of the law of continuity, and who made use of it as a principle in his reasonings on the phenomena of motion. Mr Playfair, however, with his usual discrimination and correctness, ranks this among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> discoveries of Galileo. Indeed, it does not appear that it was at all regarded by Galileo (as it avowedly was by Leibnitz) in the light of a metaphysical\nand necessary law, which could not by any possibility be violated in any of the phenomena of motion. It was probably first suggested to him by the diagram which he employed to demonstrate, or rather to illustrate, the uniformly accelerated motion of falling bodies; and the numberless and beautiful exemplifications of the same law which occur in pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, sufficiently account for the disposition which so many Mathematicians have shown to extend it to all those branches of physics which admit of a mathematical consideration.\n\nMy late illustrious friend, who, to his many other great and amiable qualities, added the most perfect fairness and candour in his inquiries after truth, has, in the posthumous fragment which has already appeared in this Supplement, expressed himself with considerably greater scepticism concerning the law of continuity, than in his Outlines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a>. In that work he pronounced the metaphysical argument, employed by Leibnitz to prove its necessity, \"to be conclusive.\" (Sect. VI, \u00a7 99, b.) In the second part of his Dissertation (p. 34), he writes thus on the same subject:\n\n\"Leibnitz considered this principle as known a priori, because, if any saltus were to take place, that is, if any change were to happen without the intervention of time, the thing changed must be in two different conditions at the same individual instant, which is obviously impossible. Whether this reasoning be quite satisfactory or no, the conformity of the law to the facts generally observed cannot but entitle it to great authority in judging of the explanations and theories of natural phenomena.\"\n\nThe phrase, Law of Continuity, occurs repeatedly in the course of the correspondence between Leibnitz and John Bernouilli, and appears to have been first used by Leibnitz himself. The following passage contains some interesting particulars concerning the history of this law: \"Lex Continuitatis, cum usque adeo sit rationi et naturae consentanea, et usum habeat tam late patentem, mirum tamen est eam a nemine (quantum recorder) antea adhibitam fuisse. Mentionem ejus aliquam feceram olim in Novellis Reipublicae Literariae (Juillet, 1687, p. 744), occasione collatione culce cum Malebranchio, qui idee meis considerationibus persuasus, suam de legibus motus in Inquisitione Veritatis expositam doctrinam postea mutavit; quod brevi libello edito testatus est, in quo ingenue occasionem mutationis exponit. Sed tamen paullo promptior, quam par erat, fuit in novis legibus constituendis in codem libello, antequam mecum communicasset; nec tantum in veritatem, sed etiam in illam ipsam Legem Continuitatis, etsi minus aperte, denuo tamen impegit; quod nolui viro optimo objicere, ne viderer ejus existimationi detrahere velle.\"\u2014Epist. Leibnit. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> Joh. Bernouilli, 1697.\n\nFrom one of John Bernouilli's letters to Leibnitz, it would appear that he had himself a conviction of the truth of this law, before he had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with Leibnitz upon the subject.\n\n\"Placet tuum criterium pro examinandis regulis motuum, quod legem continuitatis vocas; est enim per se evidens, et velut a natura nobis inditum, quod evanescente inaequalitate hypothesium, evanescere quoque debeant inaequalitates eventuum. Hinc multoties non satis mirari potui, qui\n\n---\n\n1 Descartes seems, from his correspondence with Mersenne, to have been much puzzled with Galileo's reasonings concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of falling bodies; and in alluding to it, has, on different occasions, expressed himself with an indecision and inconsistency of which few instances occur in his works. (Vide Cartesi Epist. Pars II. Epist. xxxiv. xxxv. xxxvii. &c.) His doubts on this point will appear less surprising, if compared with a passage in the article M\u00e9chanique in D'Alembert's \u00c9l\u00e9ments de Philosophie. \"Tous les philosophes paraissent convenir, que la vitesse avec laquelle les corps qui tombent commencent \u00e0 se mouvoir est absolument nulle,\" &c. &c. (See his M\u00e9langes, Tom. IV. p. 219, 220.)\nfieri potuerit, ut tam incongruas, tam absonas, et tam manifeste inter se pugnantes regulas, excepta sola prima, potuerit condere Cartesius, vir alias summi ingenii. Mihi videtur vel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> infante falsitate illarum palpari posse, ea quod ubique saltus ille, nature adeo inimicus, manifeste nimis elucet.\" (Epist. Bernouilli ad Leib. 1696. Vide Leibnitzi et Jo. Bernouilli Comm. Epist. 2 vols 4to, Lausann\u00e6 et Genev\u00e6, 1745.)\n\nNote (L.) p. 56.\n\nMais il restoit encore la plus grande question, de ce que ces \u00e2mes ou ces formes deviennent par la mort de l'animal, ou par la destruction de l'individu de la substance organis\u00e9.

Cela m'a fait juger enfin qu'il n'y avoit qu'un seul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTI\">parti</a> raisonnable \u00e0 prendre; et c'est celui de la conservation non seulement de l'\u00e2me, mais encore de l'animal m\u00eame, et de la machine organique; quoique la destruction des parties grossi\u00e8res l'ait reduit \u00e0 une petitesse qui n'\u00e9chappe pas moins \u00e0 nos sens que celle ou il estoit avant que de na\u00eetre. (Leib. Op. Tom. II. p. 51.)\n\n... Des personnes fort exactes aux exp\u00e9riences se sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 aper\u00e7ues de notre temps, qu'on peut douter, si jamais un animal tout \u00e0 fait nouveau est produit, et si les animaux tout en vie ne sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en petit avant la conception dans les semences aussi bien que les plantes. Cette doctrine \u00e9tant pos\u00e9e, il sera raisonnable de juger, que ce qui ne commence pas de vivre ne cesse pas de vivre non plus; et que la mort, comme la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, n'est que la transformation du m\u00eame animal qui est tant\u00f4t augment\u00e9, et tant\u00f4t diminu\u00e9. (Ibid. pp. 42, 43.)\n\n... Et puisq' ainsi il n'y a point de premi\u00e8re naissance ni de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration enti\u00e8rement nouvelle de l'animal, il s'ensuit qu'il n'y en aura point d'extinction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINALE\">finale</a>, ni de mort enti\u00e8re prise \u00e0 la rigueur m\u00e9taphysique; et que, par cons\u00e9quent, au lieu de la transmigration des \u00e2mes, il n'y a qu'une transformation d'un m\u00eame animal, selon que les organes sont pli\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment, et plus ou moins d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s. (Ibid. p. 52.)\n\nQuant \u00e0 la M\u00e9t\u00e9mpsychose, je crois que l'ordre ne l'admet point; il veut que tout soit explicable distinctement, et que rien ne se fasse par saut. Mais le passage de l'\u00e2me d'un corps dans l'autre serait un saut \u00e9trange et inexplicable. Il se fait toujours dans l'animal ce qui se fait pr\u00e9sentement: C'est que le corps est dans un changement continu, comme un fleuve, et ce que nous appelons g\u00e9n\u00e9ration ou mort, n'est qu'un changement plus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> et plus prompt qu'\u00e0 l'ordinaire, tel que serait le saut ou la cataracte d'une rivi\u00e8re. Mais ces sauts ne sont pas absolus et tels que je d\u00e9sapprouve; comme seroit celui d'un corps qui irait d'un lieu \u00e0 un autre sans passer par le milieu. Et de tels sauts ne sont pas seulement d\u00e9fendus dans les mouvements, mais encore dans tout ordre des choses ou des v\u00e9rit\u00e9s.\u2014The sentences which follow afford a proof of what I have elsewhere remarked, how much the mind of Leibnitz was misled, in the whole of this metaphysical theory, by habits of thinking formed in early life, amidst the hypothetical abstractions of pure geometry; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> (or idol of the mathematical den) to which the most important errors of his philosophy might, without much difficulty, be traced.\u2014\"Or comme dans une ligne de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie il y a certains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> distingu\u00e9s, qu'on appelle sommets, points d'inflexion, points de rebroussement, ou autrement; et comme il y en a des lignes qui en ont une infinit\u00e9, c'est ainsi qu'il faut concevoir\n\n---\n\n1 The experiments here referred to are the observations of Swammerdam, Malpighi, and Lewenhoeck.\nThe praise which I have bestowed on this Memoir renders it necessary for me to take some notice of a very exceptionable proposition which is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> maxim,\u2014that \"all proper names were at first Appellatives;\" a proposition so completely at variance with the commonly received opinions among later philosophers, that it seems an object of some curiosity to inquire, how far it is entitled to plead in its favour the authority of Leibnitz. Since the writings of Condillac and of Smith, it has, so far as I know, been universally acknowledged, that, if there be any one truth in the Theoretical History of Language, which we are entitled to assume as an incontrovertible fact, it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> contrary of the above proposition. Indeed, to assert that all proper names were at first appellatives, would appear to be nearly an absurdity of the same kind as to maintain, that classes of objects existed before individual objects had been brought into being.\n\nWhen Leibnitz, however, comes to explain his idea more fully, we find it to be something very different from what his words literally imply; and to amount only to the trite and indisputable observation, That, in simple and primitive languages, all proper names (such as the names of persons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, places of residence, &c.) are descriptive or significant of certain prominent and characteristical features, distinguishing them from other objects of the same class;\u2014a fact, of which a large proportion of the surnames still in use, all over Europe, as well as the names of mountains, villages, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, when traced to their primitive roots, afford numerous and well known exemplifications.\n\nNot that the proposition, even when thus explained, can be assumed as a general maxim. It holds, indeed, in many cases, as the Celtic and the Saxon languages abundantly testify in our own island; but it is true only under certain limitations, and it is perfectly consistent with the doctrine delivered on this subject by the greater part of philologers for the last fifty years.\n\nIn the history of language, nothing is more remarkable, than the aversion of men to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> words out of unmeaning and arbitrary sounds; and their eagerness to avail themselves of the stores already in their possession, in order to give utterance to their thoughts on the new topics which the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> is continually bringing within the circle of their knowledge. Hence Metaphors, and other figures of speech; and hence the various changes which words undergo, in the way of amplification, diminution, composition, and the other transformations of elementary terms which fall under the notice of the etymologist. Were it not, indeed, for this strong and universal bias of our nature, the vocabulary of every language would, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, become so extensive and unwieldy, as to render the acquisition of one's mother tongue a task of immense difficulty, and the acquisition of a dead or foreign tongue next to impossible. It is needless to observe, how immensely these tasks are facilitated by that etymological system which runs, more or less, through every language; and which everywhere proceeds on certain analogical principles, which it is the business of the practical grammarian to reduce to general rules, for the sake of those who wish to speak or to write it with correctness.\nIn attempting thus to trace backwards the steps of the mind towards the commencement of its progress, it is evident, that we must at last arrive at a set of elementary and primitive roots, of which no account can be given, but the arbitrary choice of those who first happened to employ them. It is to this first stage in the infancy of language, that Mr Smith's remarks obviously relate; whereas the proposition of Leibnitz, which gave occasion to this note, as obviously relates to its subsequent stages, when the language is beginning to assume somewhat of a regular form, by compositions and other modifications of the materials previously collected.\n\nFrom these slight hints it may be inferred, 1st, That the proposition of Leibnitz, although it may seem, from the very inaccurate and equivocal terms in which it is expressed, to stand in direct opposition to the doctrine of Smith, was really meant by the author to state a fact totally unconnected with the question under Smith's consideration. 2dly, That even in the sense in which it was understood by the author, it fails entirely, when extended to that first stage in the infancy of language, to which the introductory paragraphs in Mr Smith's discourse are exclusively confined.\n\nNote (N.) p. 62.\n\n\"Je viens de recevoir une lettre d'un <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Regnant de l'Empire, ou S. A. me marque avoir vu deux fois ce printemps \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re foire de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a> et examin\u00e9 avec soin, un chien qui parle. Ce chien a prononc\u00e9 distinctement plus de trente mots, r\u00e9pondant m\u00eame assez \u00e0 propos \u00e0 son ma\u00eetre : il a aussi prononc\u00e9 tout l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> except\u00e9 les lettres, m, n, x.\" (Leib. Opera, Tom. V. p. 72.)\n\nThus far the fact rests upon the authority of the German prince alone. But from a passage in the History of the Academy of Sciences, for the year 1706, it appears that Leibnitz had himself seen and heard the dog. What follows is transcribed from a report of the Academy upon a letter from Leibnitz to the Abb\u00e9 de St Pierre, giving the details of this extraordinary occurrence.\n\n\"Sans un garant tel que M. Leibnitz, t\u00e9moin oculaire, nous n'aurions pas la hardiesse de rapporter, qu'aupr\u00e8s de Zeitz dans la Misnie, il y a un chien qui parle. C'est un chien de Paysan, d'une figure des plus communes, et de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> mediocre. Un jeune enfant lui entendit pousser quelques sons qu'il crut ressembler \u00e0 des mots Allemands, et sur cela se mit en t\u00eate de lui apprendre \u00e0 parler. Le ma\u00eetre, qui n'avait rien de mieux \u00e0 faire, n'y \u00e9pargna pas le temps ni ses peines, et heureusement le <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> avait des dispositions qu'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de trouver dans un autre. Enfin, au bout de quelques ann\u00e9es, le chien sut prononcer environ une trentaine de mots : de ce nombre sont The, Caf\u00e9, Chocolat, Assembl\u00e9e, mots Fran\u00e7ois, qui ont pass\u00e9 dans l'Allemand tels qu'ils sont. Il est \u00e0 remarquer, que le chien avait bien trois ans quand il fut mis \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Il ne parle que par \u00e9cho, c'est \u00e0 dire, apr\u00e8s que son ma\u00eetre a prononc\u00e9 un mot ; et il semble, qu'il ne rep\u00e8te que par force et malgr\u00e9 lui, quoiqu'on ne le maltraite pas. Encore une fois, M. Leibnitz l'a vu et entendu.\"\n\n(Expos\u00e9 d'une lettre de M. Leibnitz \u00e0 l'Abb\u00e9 de St Pierre sur un chien qui parle.) \"Cet expos\u00e9 de la lettre de M. Leibnitz se trouve dans l'Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences, Ann\u00e9e 1706. Ce sont les Auteurs de l'Histoire de l'Academie qui parlent.\" (Leib. Opera, Vol. II. p. 180. P. II.)\n\nMay not all the circumstances of the above story be accounted for, by supposing the master of the dog to have possessed that peculiar species of imitative power which is called Ventri-locism? Mathews, I have no doubt, would find little difficulty in managing such a deception, so as to impose on the senses of any person who had never before witnessed any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the same kind.\n\nDISS. I. PART II.\nNote (O.) p. 62.\n\nWhen I speak in favourable terms of the Philosophical Spirit, I hope none of my readers will confound it with the spirit of that false philosophy, which, by unhinging every rational principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, seldom fails to unite in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> the extremes of scepticism and of credulity. It is a very remarkable fact, that the same period of the eighteenth century, and the same part of Europe which were most distinguished by the triumphs of Atheism and Materialism, were also distinguished by a greater number of visionaries and impostors than had ever appeared before, since the revival of letters. Nor were these follies confined to persons of little education. They extended to men of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, and to many individuals of distinguished talents. Of this the most satisfactory proofs might be produced; but I have room here only for one short quotation. It is from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of the Duc de Levis, and relates to the celebrated Mareschal de Richelieu, on whom Voltaire has lavished so much of his flattery. \"Ce dont je suis positivement certain, c'est que cet homme spirituel (Le Mareschal de Richelieu) \u00e9tait superstitieux, et qu'il croyoit aux pr\u00e9dictions des astrologues et autres sottises de cet esp\u00e8ce. Je l'ai vu refusant \u00e0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a> d'aller faire sa cour au fils ain\u00e9 de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XVI. en disant s\u00e9rieusement, qu'il savoit que cet enfant n'\u00e9toit point destin\u00e9 au tr\u00f4ne. Cette cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 superstitieuse, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pendant la ligue, \u00e9toit encore tr\u00e8s commune sous la r\u00e9gence lorsque le Duc de Richelieu entra dans le monde; par la plus bizarre des inconsequences, elle s'allioit tr\u00e8s bien avec la plus grande impi\u00e9t\u00e9, et la plupart des materialistes croyoient aux esprits; aujourd'hui, ce genre de folie est tr\u00e8s rare; mais beaucoup de gens, qui se moquent des astrologues, croient \u00e0 des pr\u00e9dictions d'une autre esp\u00e8ce.\" (Souvenirs et Portraits, par M. de Levis, \u00e0 Paris, 1813.)\n\nSome extraordinary facts of the same kind are mentioned in the Memoirs of the Marquis de Bouill\u00e9. According to him, Frederic the Great himself was not free from this sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>.\n\nNote (P.) p. 63.\n\nThe following estimate of Leibnitz, considered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with his most distinguished contemporaries, approaches, on the whole, very nearly to the truth; although some doubts may be entertained about the justness of the decision in the last clause of the sentence. \"Leibnitz, aussi hardi que Descartes, aussi subtil que Bayle, peut-\u00eatre moins profond que Newton, et moins sage que Locke, mais seul universel entre tous ces grand hommes, paroit avoir embrass\u00e9 le domaine de la raison dans toute son \u00e9tendue, et avoir contribu\u00e9 le plus \u00e0 r\u00e9pandre cet esprit philosophique que fait aujourd'hui la gloire de notre si\u00e8cle.\" (Bailly, Eloge de Leibnitz.)\n\nI have mentioned in the text only a part of the learned labours of Leibnitz. It remains to be added, that he wrote also on various subjects connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>; on the philosophy and language of the Chinese; and on numberless other topics of subordinate importance. The philological discussions and etymological collections, which occupy so large a space among his works, would (even if he had produced nothing else) have been no inconsiderable memorials of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and industry of his mind.\n\nManifold and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> as these pursuits may at first appear, it is not difficult to trace the\nthread by which his curiosity was led from one of them to another. I have already remarked a connection of the same sort between his different metaphysical and theological researches; and it may not be altogether uninteresting to extend the observation to some of the subjects enumerated in the foregoing paragraph.\n\nThe studies by which he first distinguished himself in the learned world (I pass over that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>, which was imposed on him by the profession for which he was destined) were directed to the antiquities of his own country; and more particularly to those connected with the history of the House of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>. With this view he ransacked, with an unexampled industry, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>, monasteries, and other archives, both of Germany and of Italy; employing in this ungrateful drudgery several of the best and most precious years of his life. Mortified, however, to find how narrow the limits are, within which the range of written records is confined, he struck out for himself and his successors a new and unexpected light, to guide them through the seemingly hopeless darkness of remote ages. This light was the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, and of the affinities of different tongues in their primitive roots\u2014a light at first faint and glimmering, but which, since his time, has continued to increase in brightness, and is likely to do so more and more as the world grows older. It is pleasing to see his curiosity on this subject expand, from the names of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and rivers and mountains in his neighbourhood, till it reached to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> and other regions in the East; leading him, in the last result, to some general conclusions concerning the origin of the different tribes of our species, approximating very nearly to those which have been since drawn from a much more extensive range of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> by Sir William Jones, and other philologers of the same school.\n\nAs an additional light for illustrating the antiquities of Germany, he had recourse to natural history; examining, with a scientific eye, the shells and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> bodies everywhere to be found in Europe, and the impressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and fishes (some of them unknown in this part of the world) which are distinctly legible, even by the unlettered observer, on many of our fossils. In entering upon this research, as well as on the former, he seems to have had a view to Germany alone; on the state of which (he tells us), prior to all historical documents, it was his purpose to prefix a discourse to his History of the House of Brunswick. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> soon took a bolder flight, and gave birth to his Protogaea\u2014a dissertation which (to use his own words) had for its object \"to ascertain the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the earth, and to collect the vestiges of its earliest history from the monuments which nature herself has left of her successive operations on its surface.\" It is a work, which, wild and extravagant as it may now be regarded, is spoken of by Buffon with much respect; and is considered by Cuvier as the ground-work of Buffon's own system on the same subject.\n\nIn the connection which I have now pointed out between the Historical, the Philological, and the Geological speculations of Leibnitz, Helvetius might have fancied that he saw a new exemplification of the law of continuity; but the true light in which it ought to be viewed, is as a faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of a philosophical mind emancipating itself from the trammels of local and conventional details, and gradually rising from subject to subject, till it embraces in its survey those nobler inquiries which, sooner or later, will be equally interesting to every portion of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\n---\n\n1 Bailly, in his Elogie on Leibnitz, speaks of him in terms of the most enthusiastic praise, as a philosophical jurist, and as a man fitted to become the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> of the human race. To me, I must own, it appears, that there is no part of his writings in which he discovers less of his characteristic originality, than where he professes to treat of the law of nature. On these occasions, how inferior does he appear to Grotius, not to speak of Montesquieu and his disciples!\n\n2 In the above note, I have said nothing of Leibnitz's project of a philosophical language, founded on an alphabet of Humaa.\nNote (Q.) p. 70.\n\nOf Locke's affectionate regard for Collins, notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> of their opinions on some questions of the highest moment, there exist many proofs in his letters, published by M. Des Maizeaux. In one of these, the following passage is remarkable. It is dated from Oates in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, 1703, about a year before Locke's death.\n\n\"You complain of a great many defects; and that very complaint is the highest recommendation I could desire to make me <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and esteem you, and desire your friendship. And if I were now setting out in the world, I should think it my great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> to have such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> as you, who had a true relish for truth; would in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> seek it with me; from whom I might receive it undisguised; and to whom I might communicate what I thought true freely. Believe it, my good friend, to love truth for truth's sake, is the principal part of human perfection in this world, and the seed-plot of all other virtues; and, if I mistake not, you have as much of it as ever I met with in any body. What, then, is there wanting to make you equal to the best; a friend for any one to be proud of?\" . . . . The whole of Locke's letters to Collins are highly interesting and curious; more particularly that which he desired to be delivered to him after his own death. From the general tenor of these letters, it may be inferred, that Collins had never let Locke fully into the secret of those pernicious opinions which he was afterwards at so much pains to disseminate.\n\nNote (R.) p. 72.\n\nIn addition to the account of Spinoza given in Bayle, some interesting particulars of his history may be learnt from a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, entitled, La Vie de B. de Spinoza, Tir\u00e9e des \u00e9crits de ce Fameux Philosophe, et du t\u00e9moignage de plusieurs personnes dignes de foi, qui l'ont connu particuli\u00e8rement: par Jean Colerus, Ministre de l'Eglise Lutherienne de la Haye. 1706.\u00b9 The book is evidently written by a man altogether unfit to appreciate the merits or demerits of Spinoza as an author; but it is not without some value to those who delight in the study of human character, as it supplies some chasms in the narrative of Bayle, and has every appearance of the most perfect impartiality and candour.\n\nAccording to this account, Spinoza was a person of the most quiet and inoffensive manners; of singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> and moderation in his passions; contented and happy with an income which barely supplied him with the necessaries of life; and of too independent a spirit to accept of any\n\n\u00b9 The life of Spinoza by Colerus, with some other curious pieces on the same subject, is reprinted in the complete edition of Spinoza's Works, published at Jena, in 1802.\naddition to it, either from the favour of princes, or the liberality of his friends. In conformity to\nthe law, and to the customs of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> (which he adhered to, when he thought them not un-\nreasonable, even when under the sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>), he resolved to learn some mecha-\nnical trade; and fortunately selected that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> optical glasses, in which he acquired so much\ndexterity, that it furnished him with what he conceived to be a sufficient maintenance. He ac-\nquired also enough of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a>, to produce good portraits in chalk and china-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, of\nsome distinguished persons.\n\nFor the last five years of his life he lodged in the house of a respectable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>,\nwho were tenderly attached to him, and from whom his biographer collected various interesting\nanecdotes. All of them are highly creditable to his private character, and more particularly show\nhow courteous and amiable he must have been in his intercourse with his inferiors. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> pre-\nsented for payment after his death, he is styled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Keveling, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARBER\">barber</a>-surgeon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BENE\">Bene</a>-\ndict Spinoza, of blessed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>; and the same compliment is paid to him by the tradesman who\nfurnished gloves to the mourners at his funeral.\n\nThese particulars are the more deserving of notice, as they rest on the authority of a very zeal-\nous member of the Lutheran <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>, and coincide exactly with the account given of Spi-\nnoza by the learned and candid Mosheim. \"This man (says he) observed, in his conduct, the\nrules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and probity much better than many who profess themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; nor did\nhe ever endeavour to pervert the sentiments or to corrupt the morals of those with whom he lived;\nor to inspire, in his discourse, a contempt of religion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.\" ....... (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLES\">Eccles</a>. History, trans-\nlated by Dr Maclaine, Vol. IV. p. 252.)\n\nAmong the various circumstances connected with Spinoza's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> habits, Colerus men-\ntions one very trifling singularity, which appears to me to throw a strong light on his general\ncharacter, and to furnish some apology for his eccentricities as an author. The extreme\nfeebleness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> (for he was consumptive from the age of 20) having unfitted\nhim for the enjoyment of convivial pleasures, he spent the greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in his cham-\nber alone; but when fatigued with study, he would sometimes join the family-party below, and\ntake a part in their conversation, however insignificant its subject might be. One of the amuse-\nments with which he was accustomed to unbend his mind, was that of entangling flies in a spi-\nder's web, or of setting spiders a-fighting with each other; on which occasions (it is added) he\nwould observe their combats with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, that it was not unusual for him to be seized\nwith immoderate fits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a>. Does not this slight trait indicate very decidedly a tendency to\ninsanity; a supposition by no means <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> (as will be readily admitted by all who have\npaid any attention to the phenomena of madness) with that logical acumen which is so conspicu-\nous in some of his writings?\n\nHis irreligious principles he is supposed to have adopted, in the first instance, from his Latin\npreceptor Vander Ende, a physician and classical scholar of some eminence; but it is much\nmore probable, that his chief school of atheism was the synagogue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>; where, with-\nout any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, a large proportion of the more opulent class of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> may be\nreasonably presumed to belong to the ancient sect of Sadducees. (This is, I presume, the idea of\nHeineccius in the following passage: \"Quamvis Spinoza Cartesii principia methodo mathematica\ndemonstrata dederit; Pantheismum tamen ille non ex Cartesio didicit, sed domi habuit, quos se-\nqueretur.\" In proof of this, he refers to a book entitled Spinozismus in Judaismo, by Waechterus.)\nThe blasphemous curses pronounced upon him in the sentence of excommunication were not well\ncalculated to recal him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of his ancestors: and when combined with his early and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>\nprejudices against Christianity, may go far to account for the indiscriminate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which he afterwards waged against priests of all denominations.\n\nThe ruling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of Spinoza seems to have been the love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. \"It is owned (says Bayle) that he had an extreme desire to immortalize his name, and would have sacrificed his life to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, though he should have been torn to pieces by the mob.\" (Art. Spinoza.)\n\nNote (S.) p. 79.\n\nIn proof of the impossibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">Liberty</a>, Collins argues thus:\n\n\"A second reason to prove man a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> is, because all his actions have a beginning. For whatever has a beginning must have a cause; and every cause is a necessary cause.\n\n\"If anything can have a beginning, which has no cause, then nothing can produce something. And if nothing can produce something, then the world might have had a beginning without a cause; which is an absurdity not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">atheists</a>, but is a real absurdity in itself. Liberty, therefore, or a power to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> or not to act, to do this or another thing under the same causes, is an impossibility and Atheistical.\"\n\n\"And as Liberty stands, and can only be grounded on the absurd principles of Epicurean atheism; so the Epicurean atheists, who were the most popular and most numerous sect of the atheists of antiquity, were the great assertors of liberty; as, on the other side, the Stoics, who were the most popular and numerous sect among the religionaries of antiquity, were the great assertors of fate and necessity.\" (Collins, p. 54.)\n\nAs to the above reasoning of Collins, it cannot be expected that I should, in the compass of a Note, \"boult this matter to the bran.\" It is sufficient here to remark, that it derives all its plausibility from the unqualified terms in which the maxim (\u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2) has frequently been stated. \"In the idea of every change (says Dr Price, a zealous advocate for the freedom of the will) is included that of its being an effect.\" (Review, &c. p. 30, 3d Edition.) If this maxim be literally admitted without any explanation or restriction, it seems difficult to resist the conclusions of the Necessitarians. The proper statement of Price's maxim evidently is, that \"in every change we perceive in inanimate matter, the idea of its being an effect is necessarily involved;\" and that he himself understood it under this limitation appears clearly from the application he makes of it to the point in dispute. As to intelligent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> beings, to affirm that they possess the power of self-determination, seems to me to be little more than an identical proposition. Upon an accurate analysis of the meaning of words, it will be found that the idea of an efficient cause implies the idea of Mind; and, consequently, that it is absurd to ascribe the volitions of mind to the efficiency of causes foreign to itself. To do so must unavoidably involve us in the inconsistencies of Spinozism; by forcing us to conclude that everything is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a>, and nothing active in the universe; and, consequently, that the idea of a First Cause involves an impossibility.\u2014But upon these hints I must not enlarge at present; and shall, therefore, confine myself to what falls more immediately within the scope of this Discourse, Collins's Historical Statement with respect to the tenets of the Epicureans and the Stoics.\n\n1 To the same purpose Edwards attempts to show, that \"the scheme of free-will (by affording an exception to that dictate of common sense which refers every event to a cause) would destroy the proof a posteriori for the being of God.\"\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of his assertion concerning the former, he refers to the following well known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of Lucretius:\n\nDenique si semper motus connectitur omnis,\n&c. &c. (Lucret. Lib. 2. v. 251.)\n\nOn the obscurity of this passage, and the inconsistencies involved in it, much might be said; but it is of more importance, on the present occasion, to remark its complete repugnance to the whole strain and spirit of the Epicurean Philosophy. This repugnance did not escape the notice of Cicero, who justly considers Epicurus as having contributed more to establish, by this puerile subterfuge, the authority of Fatalism, than if he had left the argument altogether untouched. \"Nec vero quisquam magis confirmare milii videtur non modo fatum, verum etiam necessitatem et vim omnium rerum, sustulisseque motus animi voluntarios, quam hic qui aliter obstiere fato fatetur se non potuisse nisi ad has commenticias declinationes confugisset.\" (Liber de Fato, cap. 20.)\n\nOn the noted expression of Lucretius (fatis avolsa voluntas) some acute remarks are made in a note on the French translation by M. de la Grange. They are not improbably from the pen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> d'Holbach, who is said to have contributed many notes to this translation. Whoever the author was, he was evidently strongly struck with the inconsistency of this particular tenet with the general principles of the Epicurean System.\n\n\"On est surpris qu' Epicure fonde la libert\u00e9 humaine sur la d\u00e9clinaison des atomes. On demande si cette d\u00e9clinaison est n\u00e9cessaire, ou si elle est simplement accidentelle. N\u00e9cessaire, comment la libert\u00e9 peut-elle en \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat? Accidentelle, par quoi est elle d\u00e9termin\u00e9e? Mais on devrait bien plut\u00f4t \u00eatre surpris, qu'il lui soit venu en id\u00e9e de rendre l'homme libre dans un syst\u00e8me qui suppose un encha\u00eenement n\u00e9cessaire de causes et d'effets. C'\u00e9toit une recherche curieuse, que la raison qui a pu faire d'Epicure l'Ap\u00f4tre de la Libert\u00e9.\" For the theory which follows on this point, I must refer to the work in question. (See Traduction Nouvelle de Lucrece, avec des Notes, par M. de la Grange, Vol. I. pp. 218, 219, 220, \u00e0 Paris, 1768.)\n\nBut whatever may have been the doctrines of some of the ancient Atheists about man's free-agency, it will not be denied, that in the History of Modern Philosophy, the schemes of Atheism and of Necessity have been hitherto always connected together. Not that I would by any means be understood to say, that every Necessitarian must ipso facto be an Atheist, or even, that any presumption is afforded by a man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the former sect, of his having the slightest bias in favour of the latter; but only that every modern Atheist I have heard of has been a Necessitarian. I cannot help adding, that the most consistent Necessitarians who have yet appeared, have been those who followed out their principles till they ended in Spinozism, a doctrine which differs from atheism more in words than in reality.\n\nIn what Collins says of the Stoics in the above quotation, he plainly proceeds on the supposition that all Fatalists are of course Necessitarians;\u00b9 and I agree with him in thinking, that this would be the case, if they reasoned logically. It is certain, however, that a great proportion of those who have belonged to the first sect have disclaimed all connection with the second. The Stoics themselves furnish one very remarkable instance. I do not know any author by whom the liberty of the will is stated in stronger and more explicit terms, than it is by Epictetus in the very first sentence of the Enchiridion. Indeed the Stoics seem, with their usual passion for exaggeration, to have carried their ideas about the freedom of the will to an unphilosophical extreme.\n\n\u00b9 Collins states this more strongly in what he says of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>. \"The Pharisees, who were a religious sect, ascribed all things to fate or to God's appointment, and it was the first article of their creed, that Fate and God do all, and, consequently, they could not assert a true liberty when they asserted a liberty together with this fatality and necessity of all things.\" (Collins, p. 54.)\nIf the belief of man's free-agency has thus maintained its ground among professed Fatalists, it need not appear surprising, that it should have withstood the strong arguments against it, which the doctrine of the eternal decrees of God, and even that of the Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESCIENCE\">prescience</a>, appear at first sight to furnish. A remarkable instance of this occurs in St Augustine (distinguished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> history by the title of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> of Grace), who has asserted the liberty of the will in terms as explicit as those in which he has announced the theological dogmas with which it is most difficult to reconcile it. Nay, he has gone so far as to acknowledge the essential importance of this belief, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to virtuous conduct. \"Quocirca nullo modo cogimur, aut retent\u00e2 praescienti\u00e2 Dei, tollere voluntatis arbitrium, aut retento voluntatis arbitrio, Deum, quod nefas est, negare praescribatur futurorum, sed utrumque amplectimur, utrumque fidelituri et veraciter confitemur: illud, ut bene credamus; hoc ut bene vivamus.\"\n\nDescartes has expressed himself on this point nearly to the same purpose with St Augustine. In one passage he asserts, in the most unqualified terms, that God is the cause of all the actions which depend on the Free-will of Man; and yet, that the Will is really free, he considers as a fact perfectly established by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of consciousness. \"Sed quemadmodum existentiae divin\u00e6 cognitio non debet liberi nostri arbitrii certitudinem tollere, quia illud in nobismet ipsis experimur et sentimus; ita neque liberi nostri arbitrii cognitio existentiam Dei apud nos dubiam facere debet. Independentia enim illa quam experimur, atque in nobis persentiscimus, et quae actionibus nostris laude vel vituperio dignis efficiendi sufficit, non pugnat cum dependentia alterius generis, secundum quam omnia Deo subjiciuntur.\" (Cartesii Epistol\u00e6, Epist. VIII. IX. Pars i.) These letters form part of his correspondence with the Princess Elizabeth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Frederick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">Elector</a> Palatine.\n\nWe are told by Dr Priestley, in the very interesting Memoirs of his own Life, that he was educated in the strict principles of Calvinism; and yet it would appear, that while he remained a Calvinist, he entertained no doubt of his being a free-agent. \"The doctrine of necessity (he also tells us) he first learned from Collins;\"\u00b9 and was established in the belief of it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>'s Observations on Man.\" (Ibid. p. 19.) He farther mentions in another work, that \"he was not a ready <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> to the doctrine of necessity, and that, like Dr Hartley himself, he gave up his liberty with great reluctance.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a> to the Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated, 2d Edit. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, 1782, p. xxvii.)\n\nThese instances afford a proof, I do not say of the compatibility of man's free-agency with those schemes with which it seems most at variance, but of this compatibility in the opinion of some of the profoundest thinkers who have turned their attention to the argument. No conclusion, therefore, can be drawn against a man's belief in his own free-agency, from his embracing other metaphysical or theological tenets, with which it may appear to ourselves impossible to reconcile it.\n\nAs for the notion of liberty, for which Collins professes himself an advocate, it is precisely that of his predecessor Hobbes, who defines a free-agent to be, \"he that can do if he will, and forbear if he will.\" (Hobbes's Works, p. 484, fol. ed.) The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> has been adopted by Leibnitz, by Graveshane, by Edwards, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, and by all our later necessitarians. It cannot be better ex-\n\n\u00b9 We are elsewhere informed by Priestley, that \"it was in consequence of reading and studying the Inquiry of Collins, he was first convinced of the truth of the doctrine of Necessity, and was enabled to see the fallacy of most of the arguments in favour of Philosophical Liberty: though (he adds) I was much more confirmed in this principle by my acquaintance with Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind; a work to which I owe much more than I am able to express.\"\u2014(Preface, &c. &c. p. xxvii.)\npressed than in the words of Graveshane: \"Facultas faciendi quod libuerit, quaecunque fuerit voluntatis determinatio.\" (Introed. ad Philosoph. \u00a7 115.)\n\nDr Priestley ascribes this peculiar notion of free-will to Hobbes as its author; but it is, in fact, of much older date even among modern metaphysicians; coinciding exactly with the doctrine of those scholastic divines who contended for the Liberty of Spontaneity, in opposition to the Liberty of Indifference. It is, however, to Hobbes that the partizans of this opinion are indebted for the happiest and most popular illustration of it that has yet been given. \"I conceive (says he) liberty to be rightly defined, The absence of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> to action that are not contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the agent. As, for example, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is said to descend freely, or to have liberty to descend by the channel of the river, because there is no impediment that way: but not across, because the banks are impediments. And though water cannot ascend, yet men never say, it wants the liberty to ascend, but the faculty or power, because the impediment is in the nature of the water, and intrinsical. So also we say, he that is tied wants the liberty to go, because the impediment is not in him, but in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; whereas we say not so of him who is sick or lame, because the impediment is in himself.\" (Treatise of Liberty and Necessity.)\n\nAccording to Bonnet, \"moral liberty is the power of the mind to obey without constraint the impulse of the motives which act upon it.\" This definition, which is obviously the same in substance with that of Hobbes, is thus very justly, as well as acutely, animadverted on by Cuvier. \"N'admettant aucune action sans motif, comme dit-il, il n'y a aucun effet sans cause, Bonnet definit la libert\u00e9 morale le pouvoir de l'\u00e2me de suivre sans contrainte les motifs dont elle \u00e9prouve l'impulsion; et r\u00e9sout ainsi les objections que l'on tire de la pr\u00e9vision de Dieu; mais peut-\u00eatre aussi detournent-t-il l'id\u00e9e qu'on se fait d'ordinaire de la libert\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 ces opinions que touchent au Mat\u00e9rialisme et au Fatalisme, Bonnet fut tr\u00e8s religieux.\" (Biographie Universelle, \u00e0 Paris, 1812. Art. Bonnet.)\n\nFrom this passage it appears, that the very ingenious writer was as completely aware as Clarke or Reid, of the unsoundness of the definition of moral liberty given by Hobbes and his followers; and that the ultimate tendency of the doctrine which limits the free-agency of man to (what has been called) the liberty of spontaneity, was the same, though in a more disguised form, with that of fatalism.\n\nFor a complete exposure of the futility of this definition of liberty, as the word is employed in the controversy about man's free-agency, I have only to refer to Clarke's remarks on Collins, and to Dr Reid's Essays on the Active Powers of Man. In this last work, the various meanings of this very ambiguous word are explained with great accuracy and clearness.\n\nThe only two opinions which, in the actual state of metaphysical science, ought to be stated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a>, are that of Liberty (or free-will) on the one side, and that of Necessity on the other. As to the Liberty of Spontaneity (which expresses a fact altogether foreign to the point in question), I can conceive no motive for inventing such a phrase, but a desire in some writers to veil the scheme of necessity from their readers, under a language less revolting to the sentiments of mankind; and, in others, an anxiety to banish it as far as possible from their own thoughts, by substituting instead of the terms in which it is commonly expressed, a circumlocution which seems, on a superficial view, to concede something to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for liberty.\n\n---\n\n1 \"The doctrine of philosophical necessity,\" says Priestley, \"is in reality a modern thing, not older, I believe, than Mr Hobbes. Of the Calvinists, I believe Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JONATHAN\">Jonathan</a> Edwards to be the first.\" (Illustrations of Philosophical Necessity, p. 195.)\n\nSupposing this statement to be correct, does not the very modern date of Hobbes's alleged discovery furnish a very strong presumption against it?\nIf this phrase (the Liberty of Spontaneity) should fall into disuse, the other phrase (the Liberty of Indifference), which is commonly stated in opposition to it, would become completely useless; nor would there be occasion for qualifying with any epithet, the older, simpler, and much more intelligible word, Free-will.\n\nThe distinction between physical and moral necessity I conceive to be not less frivolous than those to which the foregoing animadversions relate. On this point I agree with Diderot, that the word necessity (as it ought to be understood in this dispute) admits but of one interpretation.\n\nNote (T.) p. 79.\n\nTo the arguments of Collins, against man's free-agency, some of his successors have added, the inconsistency of this doctrine with the known effects of education (under which phrase they comprehend the moral effects of all the external circumstances in which men are involuntarily placed) in forming the characters of individuals.\n\nThe plausibility of this argument (on which much stress has been laid by Priestley and others) arises entirely from the mixture of truth which it involves; or, to express myself more correctly, from the evidence and importance of the fact on which it proceeds, when that fact is stated with due limitations.\n\nThat the influence of education, in this comprehensive sense of the word, was greatly underrated by our ancestors, is now universally acknowledged; and it is to Locke's writings, more than to any other single cause, that the change in public opinion on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is to be ascribed. On various occasions, he has expressed himself very strongly with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of this influence; and has more than once intimated his belief, that the great majority of men continue through life what early education had made them. In making use, however, of this strong language, his object (as is evident from the opinions which he has avowed in other parts of his works) was only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> the attention of his readers to the practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> he was anxious to inculcate; and not to state a metaphysical fact which was to be literally and rigorously interpreted in the controversy about liberty and necessity. The only sound and useful moral to be drawn from the spirit of his observations is, the duty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> for all the blessings, in respect of education and of external situation, which have fallen to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>; the impossibility of ascertaining the involuntary misfortunes by which the seeming demerits of others may have been in part occasioned, and in the same proportion diminished; and the consequent obligation upon ourselves, to think as charitably as possible of their conduct, under the most unfavourable appearances. The truth of all this I conceive to be implied in these words of Scripture, \"To whom much is given, of him much will be required;\" and, if possible, still more explicitly and impressively, in the Parable of the Talents.\n\nIs not the use which has been made by Necessitarians of Locke's Treatise on Education, and other books of a similar tendency, only one instance more of that disposition, so common among metaphysical Sciolists, to appropriate to themselves the conclusions of their wiser and more sober predecessors, under the startling and imposing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> of universal maxims, admitting neither of exception nor restriction? It is thus that Locke's judicious and refined remarks on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> of Ideas have been exaggerated to such an extreme in the coarse caricatures of Hartley and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">Priest</a>-\n\n1 Both phrases are favourite expressions with Lord Kames in his discussions on this subject. See in particular the Appendix to his Essay on Liberty and Necessity, in the last Edition of his Essays on Morality and Natural Religion.\nley, as to bring, among cautious inquirers, some degree of discredit on one of the most important doctrines of modern philosophy. Or, to take another case still more in point; it is thus that Locke's reflections on the effects of education in modifying the intellectual faculties, and (where skilfully conducted) in supplying their original defects, have been distorted into the puerile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> of Helvetius, that the mental capacities of the whole human race are the same at the moment of birth. It is sufficient for me here to throw out these hints, which will be found to apply equally to a large proportion of other theories started by modern metaphysicians.\n\nBefore I finish this note, I cannot refrain from remarking, with respect to the argument for Necessity drawn from the Divine prescience, that, if it be conclusive, it only affords an additional confirmation of what Clarke has said concerning the identity of the creed of the Necessitarians with that of the Spinozists. For, if God certainly foresees all the future volitions of his creatures, he must, for the same reason, foresee all his own future volitions; and if this knowledge infers a necessity of volition in the one case, how is it possible to avoid the same inference in the other?\n\nNote (U.) p. 80.\n\nA similar application of St Paul's comparison of the potter is to be found both in Hobbes and in Collins. Also, in a note annexed by Cowley to his ode entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">Destiny</a>; an ode written (as we are informed by the author) \"upon an extravagant supposition of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> playing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESS\">chess</a>; which, if they did, the spectators would have reason as much to believe that the pieces moved themselves, as we have for thinking the same of mankind, when we see them exercise so many and so different actions. It was of old said by Plautus, Dii nos quasi pilas homines habent. 'We are but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENNIS\">tennis</a>-balls for the gods to play withal,' which they strike away at last, and still call for new ones; and St Paul says, 'We are but the clay in the hand of the potter.'\n\nFor the comparison of the potter, alluded to by these different writers, see the epistle to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, Chap. ix. verses 18, 19, 20, 21. Upon these verses the only comment which I have to offer is a remark of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>; that \"In the epistles of our beloved brother Paul are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest unto their own destruction.\"\n\nThe same similitude of the potter makes a conspicuous figure in the writings of Hobbes, who has availed himself of this, as of many other insulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Holy Writ, in support of principles which are now universally allowed to strike at the very root of religion and morality. The veneration of Cowley for Hobbes is well known, and is recorded by himself in the ode which immediately precedes that on Destiny. It cannot, however, be candidly supposed, that Cowley understood the whole drift of Hobbes' doctrines. The contrary, indeed, in the present instance, is obvious from the ode before us; for while Cowley supposed the angels to move, like chess-men, the inhabitants of this globe, Hobbes (along with Spinoza) plainly conceived that the angels themselves, and even that Being to which he impiously gave the name of God, were all of them moved, like knights and pawns, by the invisible hand of fate or necessity.\n\nWere it not for the serious and pensive cast of Cowley's mind, and his solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the authority of the apostle, in support of the doctrine of destiny, one would be tempted to consider the first stanzas of this ode in the light of a jeu d'esprit, introductory to the very characteristical and interesting picture of himself, with which the poem concludes.\nNote (X.) p. 82.\n\n\"Tout ce qui est doit \u00eatre, par cela m\u00eame que cela est.

On ne con\u00e7oit non plus qu'un \u00eatre agisse sans motif, qu'un des bras d'une <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> agisse sans l'action d'un poids, et le motif nous est toujours ext\u00e9rieur, \u00e9tranger, attach\u00e9s ou par une nature ou par une cause quelconque, qui n'est pas nous. Ce qui nous trompe, c'est la prodigieuse vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de nos actions, jointe \u00e0 l'habitude que nous avons prise tout en naissant, de confondre le volontaire avec le libre. Nous avons tant lou\u00e9, tant repris, nous l'avons \u00e9t\u00e9 tant de fois, que c'est un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 bien vieux que celui de croire que nous et les autres voulons, agissons librement. Mais s'il n'y a point de libert\u00e9, il n'y a point d'action qui m\u00e9rite la louange ou le bl\u00e2me; il n'y a ni vice, ni vertu, rien dont il faille r\u00e9compenser ou ch\u00e2tier. Qu'est-ce qui distingue donc les hommes? La bienfaisance ou la malfaisance. Le malfaisant est un homme qu'il faut d\u00e9truire en non punir; la bienfaisance est une bonne fortune, et non une vertu. Mais quoique l'homme bien ou malfaisant ne soit pas libre, l'homme n'en est pas moins un \u00eatre qu'on modifie; c'est par cette raison qu'il faut d\u00e9truire le malfaisant sur une place publique. De l\u00e0 les bons effets de l'exemple, des discours, de l'\u00e9ducation, du plaisir, de la douleur, des grandeurs, de la mis\u00e8re, &c.; de l\u00e0 une sorte de philosophie pleine de commis\u00e9ration, qui attache fortement aux bons, qui n'irrite non plus contre le m\u00e9chant, que contre un ouragan qui nous remplit les yeux de poussi\u00e8re. Il n'y a qu'une sorte de causes \u00e0 proprement parler; ce sont les causes physiques. Il n'y a qu'une sorte de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, c'est la m\u00eame pour tous les \u00eatres. Voil\u00e0 ce qui me r\u00e9concilie avec le genre humain; c'est pour cette raison que je vous exhortais \u00e0 la philanthropie. Adoptez ces principes si vous les trouvez bons, ou montrez-moi qu'ils sont mauvais. Si vous les adoptez, ils vous r\u00e9concilieront aussi avec les autres et avec vous-m\u00eame; vous ne vous saurez ni bon ni mauvais gr\u00e9 d'\u00eatre ce qui vous \u00eates. Ne rien reprocher aux autres, ne se repentir de rien; voil\u00e0 les premiers pas vers la sagesse.

The following passage concerning Knox may serve as a specimen of the others. It is quoted by Bayle from the Cosmographie Universelle of Thevet, a writer who has long sunk into the contempt he merited, but whose zeal for legitimacy and the Catholic faith raised him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of almoner to Catherine de Medicis, and of historiographer to the King of France. I borrow the translation from the English Historical Dictionary.\n\n\"During that time the Scots never left England in peace; it was when Henry VIII. played his\npranks with the chalices, relics, and other ornaments of the English churches; which tragedies and plays have been acted in our time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Scotland, by the exhortations of Noptz, the first Scots minister of the bloody Gospel. This firebrand of sedition could not be content with barely following the steps of Luther, or of his master, Calvin, who had not long before delivered him from the gallies of the Prior of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPUA\">Capua</a>, where he had been three years for his crimes, unlawful amours, and abominable fornications; for he used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> a dissolute life, in shameful and odious places, and had been also found guilty of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARRICIDE\">parricide</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> committed on the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of St Andrew's, by the contrivances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Rophol, of James Lescle, John Lescle, their uncle, and William du Coy. This simonist, who had been a priest of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, being fattened by the benefices he had enjoyed, sold them for ready <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; and finding that he could not make his cause good, he gave himself up to the most terrible blasphemies. He persuaded also several devout wives and religious virgins to abandon themselves to wicked adulterers. Nor was this all. During two whole years, he never ceased to rouse the people, encouraging them to take up arms against the Queen, and to drive her out of the kingdom, which he said was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a>, as it had been formerly in the time of heathenism. The Lutherans have churches and oratories. Their ministers sing psalms, and say <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>; and though it be different from ours, yet they add to it the Creed, and other prayers, as we do. And when their ministers officiate, they wear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPE\">cope</a>, the chasuble, and the surplice, as ours do, being concerned for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>, and careful of what relates to the public worship. Whereas the Scots have lived these twelve years past without laws, without religion, without ceremonies, constantly refusing to own a King or a Queen, as so many brutes, suffering themselves to be imposed upon by the stories told them by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>-hypocrite Noptz, a traitor to God and to his country, rather than to follow the pure Gospel, the councils, and the doctrine of so many holy doctors, both Greek and Latin, of the Catholic church.\"\n\nIf any of my readers be yet unacquainted with the real character and history of this distinguished person, it may amuse them to compare the above passage with the very able, authentic, and animated account of his life, lately published by the reverend and learned Dr McCrie.\n\nNote (Z.) p. 100.\n\nDr Blair (whose estimate of the distinguishing beauties and imperfections of Addison's style reflects honour on the justness and discernment of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>) has allowed himself to be carried along much too easily, by the vulgar sneers at Addison's want of philosophical depth. In one of his lectures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> he has even gone so far as to accuse Addison of misapprehending, or, at least, of mistating Locke's doctrine concerning secondary qualities. But a comparison of Dr Blair's own statement with that which he censures, will not turn out to the advantage of the learned critic; and I willingly lay hold of this example, as the point at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> turns on one of the most refined questions of metaphysics. The words of Addison are these\u2014\n\n\"Things would make but a poor appearance to the eye, if we saw them only in their proper figures and motions. And what reason can we assign for their exciting in us many of those ideas which are different from anything that exists in the object themselves (for such are light and colours), were it not to add supernumerary ornaments to the universe, and make it more agreeable to the imagination?\"\n\nThus Thivet (says Bayle) writes the name of Knox.\nAfter quoting this sentence, Dr Blair proceeds thus:\n\n\"Our author is now entering on a theory, which he is about to illustrate, if not with much philosophical accuracy, yet with great beauty of fancy and glow of expression. A strong instance of his want of accuracy appears in the manner in which he opens the subject. For what meaning is there in things exciting in us many of those ideas which are different from any thing that exists in the objects? No one, sure, ever imagined that our ideas exist in the objects. Ideas, it is agreed on all hands, can exist nowhere but in the mind. What Mr Locke's philosophy teaches, and what our author should have said, is, exciting in us many ideas of qualities which are different from any thing that exists in the objects.\"\n\nLet us now attend to Locke's theory as stated by himself:\n\n\"From whence I think it is easy to draw this observation, That the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are resemblances of them, and their patterns do really exist in the bodies themselves, but the ideas produced in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all. There is nothing like our ideas existing in the bodies themselves. They are in the bodies we denominate from them, only a power to produce these sensations in us. And what is sweet, blue, or warm in idea, is but the certain bulk, figure, and motion of the insensible parts in the bodies themselves, which we call so.\"\n\nThe inaccuracy of Locke in conceiving that our ideas of primary qualities are resemblances of these qualities, and that the patterns of such ideas exist in the bodies themselves, has been fully exposed by Dr Reid. But the repetition of Locke's inaccuracy (supposing Addison to have been really guilty of it) should not be charged upon him as a deviation from his master's doctrine. To all, however, who understand the subject, it must appear evident, that Addison has, in this instance, improved greatly on Locke, by keeping out of view what is most exceptionable in his language, while he has retained all that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> in his doctrine. For my own part, I do not see how Addison's expressions could be altered to the better, except, perhaps, by substituting the words unlike to, instead of different from. But in this last phrase, Addison has been implicitly followed by Dr Blair, and certainly would not have been disavowed as an interpreter by Locke himself. Let me add, that Dr Blair's proposed emendation (\"exciting in us many ideas of qualities, which are different from any thing that exists in the objects\"), if not wholly unintelligible, deviates much farther from Locke's meaning than the correspondent clause in its original state. The additional words of qualities throw an obscurity over the whole proposition, which was before sufficiently precise and perspicuous.\n\nMy principal reason for offering these remarks in vindication of Addison's account of secondary qualities was, to prepare the way for the sequel of the passage animadverted on by Dr Blair.\n\n---\n\n1 Another passage, afterwards quoted by Dr Blair, might have satisfied him of the clearness and accuracy of Addison's ideas on the subject.\n\n\"I have here supposed that my reader is acquainted with that great modern discovery, which is, at present, universally acknowledged by all the inquirers into natural philosophy; namely, that light and colours, as apprehended by the imagination, are only ideas in the mind, and not qualities that have any existence in matter. As this is a truth which has been proved incontrovertibly by many modern philosophers, if the English reader would see the notion explained at large, he may find it in the eighth book of Mr Locke's Essay on Human Understanding.\"\n\nI have already taken notice (Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, Vol. I. Note P.) of the extraordinary precision of the above statement, arising from the clause printed in Italics. By a strange slip of memory I ascribed the merit of this very judicious qualification, not to Addison, but to Dr Akenside, who transcribed it from the Spectator.\n\nThe last quotation affords me also an opportunity of remarking the correctness of Addison's information about the history of this doctrine, which most English writers have conceived to be an original speculation of Locke's. From some of Addison's expressions, it is more than probable, that he had derived his first knowledge of it from Malebranche.\n\"We are everywhere entertained with pleasing shows and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARITIONS\">apparitions</a>. We discover imaginary glories in the heavens and in the earth, and see some of this visionary beauty poured out upon the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. But what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be entertained with; did all her colouring disappear, and the several distinctions of light and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> vanish? In short, our souls are delightfully lost and bewildered in a pleasing delusion, and we walk about like the enchanted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>, who sees beautiful castles, woods, and meadows, and, at the same time, hears the warbling of birds and the purling of streams; but, upon the finishing of some secret spell, the fantastic scene breaks up, and the disconsolate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> finds himself on a barren heath, or in a solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>.\"\n\nIn this passage one is at a loss whether most to admire the author's depth and refinement of thought, or the singular felicity of fancy displayed in its illustration. The image of the enchanted hero is so unexpected, and, at the same time, so exquisitely appropriate, that it seems itself to have been conjured up by an enchanter's wand. Though introduced with the unpretending simplicity of a poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a>, it has the effect of shedding the light of day on one of the darkest corners of metaphysics. Nor is the language in which it is conveyed unworthy of the attention of the critic; abounding throughout with those natural and happy graces, which appear artless and easy to all but to those who have attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> them.\n\nThe praise which I have bestowed on Addison as a commentator on this part of Locke's Essay will not appear extravagant to those who may take the trouble to compare the conciseness and elegance of the foregoing extracts with the prolixity and homeliness of the author's text. (See Locke's Essay, Book II. chap. viii, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18.) It is sufficient to mention here, that his chief illustration is taken from \"the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> on the stomach and guts.\"\n\nNote (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">AA</a>.) p. 111.\n\nFor the following note I am indebted to my learned friend Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, Professor of Universal History in the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\"The Clavis Universalis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Collier, though little known in England, has been translated into German. It is published in a work entitled \"Samlung,\" &c. &c., literally, \"A Collection of the most distinguished authors who deny the existence of their own bodies, and of the whole material world,\u2014containing the dialogues of Berkeley, between Hylas and Philonous, and Collier's Universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">Key</a> translated, with Illustrative Observations, and an Appendix, wherein the existence of Body is demonstrated, by John Christopher Eschenbach, Professor of Philosophy in Rostock.\" (Rostock, 1756, 8vo.) The remarks are numerous, and show much reading. The Appendix contains, 1. An exposition of the opinion of the Idealists, with its grounds and arguments. 2. A proof of the external existence of body. The argument on which he chiefly dwells to show the existence of matter is the same with that of Dr Reid, in so far as he says \"a direct proof must not here be expected; in regard to the fundamental principles of human nature, this is seldom possible, or rather is absolutely impossible.\" He argues at length, that the Idealist has no better proof of the existence of his soul, than of the existence of his body; \"when an Idealist says, I am a thinking being; of this I am certain from internal conviction;\"\u2014I would ask from whence he derives this certainty, and why he ex-\n\n1 On the supposition made in this sentence, the face of Nature, instead of presenting a \"rough unsightly sketch,\" would, it is evident, become wholly invisible. But I need scarcely say, this does not render Mr Addison's allusion less pertinent.\ncludes from this conviction the possibility of deception. He has no other answer than this, I feel it. It is impossible that I can have any representation of self without the consciousness of being a thinking being. In the same manner, Eschenbach argues that the feeling applies to the existence of body, and that the ground of belief is equally strong and conclusive, in respect to the reality of the objective, as of the subjective, in perception.\"\n\nNote (BB.) p. 132.\n\n\"And yet Diderot, in some of his lucid intervals, seems to have thought and felt very differently.\"\n\nThe following passage (extracted from his Pens\u00e9es Philosophiques) is pronounced by La Harpe to be not only one of the most eloquent which Diderot has written, but to be one of the best comments which is anywhere to be found on the Cartesian argument for the existence of God. It has certainly great merit in point of reasoning, but I cannot see with what propriety it can be considered as a comment upon the argument of Descartes; nor am I sure if, in point of eloquence, it be as well suited to the English as to the French taste.\n\n\"Convenez qu'il y aurait de la folie \u00e0 refuser \u00e0 vos semblables la facult\u00e9 de penser. Sans doute, mais que s'ensuit-il de l\u00e0? Il s'ensuit, que si l'univers, que <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-je l'univers, si l'aile d'un papillon m'offre des traces mille fois plus distinctes d'une intelligence que vous n'avez d'indices que votre semblable \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de penser, il est mille fois plus fou de nier qu'il existe un Dieu, que de nier que votre semblable pense. Or, que cela soit ainsi, c'est \u00e0 vos lumi\u00e8res, c'est \u00e0 votre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> que j'en appelle. Avez-vous jamais remarqu\u00e9 dans les raisonnemens, les actions, et la conduite de quelque homme que ce soit, plus d'intelligence, d'ordre, de sagacit\u00e9, de cons\u00e9quence, que dans le m\u00e9canisme d'un insecte? La divinit\u00e9 n'est elle pas aussi clairement empreinte dans l'\u0153il d'un ciron, que la facult\u00e9 de penser dans les \u00e9crits du grand Newton? Quoi! le monde form\u00e9 prouverait moins d'intelligence, que le monde expliqu\u00e9? Quelle assertion! l'intelligence d'un premier \u00eatre ne m'est pas mieux d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par ses ouvrages, que la facult\u00e9 de penser dans un philosophe par ses \u00e9crits? Songez donc que je ne vous objecte que l'aile d'un papillon, quand je pourrais vous \u00e9craser du poids de l'univers.\"\n\nThis, however, was certainly not the creed which Diderot professed in his more advanced years. The article, on the contrary, which immediately follows the foregoing quotation, there is every reason to think, expresses his real sentiments on the subject. I transcribe it at length, as it states clearly and explicitly the same argument which is indirectly hinted at in a late publication by a far more illustrious author.\n\n\"J'ouvre les cahiers d'un philosophie c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, et je lis. 'Ath\u00e9es, je vous accorde que le mouvement est essentiel \u00e0 la mati\u00e8re; qu'en concluez-vous? que le monde resulte du jet fortuit d'atomes? J'aimerois autant que vous me dissiez que l'Iliade d'Hom\u00e8re ou la Henriade de Voltaire est un r\u00e9sultat de jets fortuits de caract\u00e8res?' Je me garderai bien de faire ce raisonnement \u00e0 un ath\u00e9e. Cette comparaison lui donneroit beau jeu. Selon les lois de l'analyse des sorts, me dirait-il, je ne doit \u00eatre surpris qu'une chose arrive, lorsqu'elle est possible, et que la difficult\u00e9 de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement est compens\u00e9e par la quantit\u00e9 des jets. Il y a tels nombre de coups dans lesquels je gagerois avec avantage d'amener cent mille six \u00e0 la fois avec cent mille dez. Quelle que f\u00fbt la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMME\">somme</a> finie de caract\u00e8res avec laquelle on me proposeroit d'engendrer fortuitement l'Iliade, il y a telle somme finie de jets qui me rendroit la proposition avantageuse; mon avantage seroit m\u00eame infinie, si la quantit\u00e9 de jets accord\u00e9e etoit infini,\" &c. &c. (Pens\u00e9es Philosophiques, par Diderot, XXI.)\nMy chief reason for considering this as the genuine exposition of Diderot's own creed is, that he omits no opportunity of suggesting the same train of thinking in his other works. It may be distinctly traced in the following passage of his *Trait\u00e9 du Beau*, the substance of which he has also introduced in the article *Beau* of the *Encyclop\u00e9die*.\n\n\"Le beau n'est pas toujours l'ouvrage d'une cause intelligente; le mouvement \u00e9tablit souvent, soit dans un \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 solitairement, soit entre plusieurs \u00eatres compar\u00e9s entr'eux, une multitude prodigieuse de rapports surprenants. Les cabinets d'histoire naturelle en offrent un grand nombre d'exemples. Les rapports sont alors des r\u00e9sultats de combinaisons fortuites, du moins par rapport \u00e0 nous. La nature imite en se jouant, dans cent occasions, les productions d'art; et l'on pourrait demander, je ne dis pas si ce philosophe qui fut jet\u00e9 par une temp\u00eate sur les bords d'une \u00eele inconnue, avait raison de se crier, \u00e0 la vue de quelques figures de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie; 'Courage mes amis, voici des pas d'hommes;' mais combien il faudroit remarquer de rapports dans un \u00eatre, pour avoir une certitude compl\u00e8te qu'il est l'ouvrage d'un artiste (en quelle occasion, un seul d\u00e9faut de sym\u00e9trie prouveroit plus que toute somme donn\u00e9e de rapports); comment sont entr'eux le temps de l'action de la cause fortuite, et les rapports observ\u00e9s dans les effets produits; et si (\u00e0 l'exception des \u0153uvres du Tout-Puissant) il y a des cas o\u00f9 le nombre des rapports ne puisse jamais \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par celui des jets.\"\n\nWith respect to the passages here extracted from Diderot, it is worthy of observation, that if the atheistical argument from chances be conclusive in its application to that order of things which we behold, it is not less conclusive when applied to every other possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of atoms which imagination can conceive, and affords a mathematical proof, that the fables of Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a>, the tales of the gemii, and the dreams of the Rosicrusians, may, or rather must, all of them, be somewhere or other realized in the infinite extent of the universe; a proposition which, if true, would destroy every argument for or against any given system of opinions founded on the reasonableness or the unreasonableness of the tenets involved in it; and would, of consequence, lead to the subversion of the whole frame of the human understanding.\n\n---\n\n1 Is not this precisely the sophistical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of questioning known among Logicians by the name of *Sorites* or *Accrescens*? *Vitiosum sane (says Cicero) et captivum genus.* (Acad. Quaest. Lib. IV. xvi.)\n\n2 To those who enter fully into the spirit of the foregoing reasoning, it is unnecessary to observe, that this parenthetical clause is nothing better than an ironical *salto*. If the argument proves anything it leads to this general conclusion, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> order of the universe affords no evidence whatever of the existence of a designing cause.\n\n3 The atheistical argument here quoted from Diderot is, at least, as old as the time of Epicurus.\n\nNam certe neque consilio primordia rerum\nOrdine se quaoque, atque sagaci mente locarunt;\nNec quae quaque darent motus pepigere profecto;\nSed quia multimodis, multis, mutata, per omne\nEx infinito vexantur percita plagis,\nOmne genus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIS\">motis</a>, et certas expeririendo,\nTandem deveniunt in taleis disposituras,\nQualibus h\u00e6c rebus consistit summa creat\u00e6.\n(Lucret. Lib. I. l. 1020.)\n\nAnd still more explicitly in the following lines:\nNam cum respicias immensi temporis omne\nPr\u00e6teritum spatium; tum motus materiarum\nMultimodi qu\u00e0m sint; facil\u00e8 hoc adcredere possis,\nSemina s\u00e6pe in eodem, ut nunc sunt, ordine posita.\n(Ibid. Lib. III. l. 867.)\nMr Hume, in his *Natural History of Religion* (Sect. XI.), has drawn an inference from the internal evidence of the Heathen Mythology, in favour of the supposition, that it may not be altogether so fabulous as is commonly supposed. \"The whole mythological system is so natural, that in the vast variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> and worlds contained in this universe, it seems more than probable, that somewhere or other it is really carried into execution.\" The argument of Diderot goes much farther, and leads to an extension of Mr Hume's conclusion to all conceivable systems, whether natural or not.\n\nBut further, since the human mind, and all the numberless displays of wisdom and of power which it has exhibited, are ultimately to be referred to a fortuitous conourse of atoms, why might not the Supreme Being, such as we are commonly taught to regard him, have been Himself (as well as the Gods of Epicurus)\u2020 the result of the continued operation of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> causes? or rather, must not such a Being have necessarily resulted from these causes operating from all eternity, through the immensity of space?\u2014a conclusion, by the way, which, according to Diderot's own principles, would lead us to refer the era of his origin to a period indefinitely more remote than any given point of time which imagination can assign; or, in other words, to a period to which the epithet eternal may with perfect propriety be applied. The amount, therefore, of the whole matter is this, that the atheistical reasoning, as stated by Diderot, leaves the subject of natural, and, I may add, of revealed religion, precisely on the same footing as before, without invalidating, in the very smallest degree, the evidence for any one of the doctrines connected with either; nay more, superadding to this evidence, a mathematical demonstration of the possible truth of all those articles of belief which it was the object of Diderot to subvert from their foundation.\n\nIt might be easily shown, that these principles, if pushed to their legitimate consequences, instead of establishing the just authority of reason in our constitution, would lead to the most unlimited credulity on all subjects whatever; or (what is only another name for the same thing) to that state of mind, which, in the words of Mr Hume, \"does not consider any one proposition as more certain, or even as more probable, than another.\"\n\nThe following curious and (in my opinion) instructive anecdote has a sufficient connection with the subject of this note, to justify me in subjoining it to the foregoing observations. I transcribe it from the Notes annexed to the Abb\u00e9 de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LILLE\">Lille</a>'s poem, entitled *La Conversation*. (A Paris, 1812.)\n\n\"Dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Baron d'Holbach, Diderot proposa un jour de nommer un avocat de Dieu, et on choisit l'Abb\u00e9 Galiani. Il s'assit et d\u00e9buta ainsi:\n\n\"Un jour \u00e0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, un homme de la Basilicate prit devant nous, six d\u00e9s dans un cornet, et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIA\">paria</a> d'amener rafle de six. Je dis cette chance \u00e9tait possible. Il l'amena sur le champ une seconde fois; je dis la m\u00eame chose. Il remit les d\u00e9s dans le cornet trois, quatre, cinq fois, et toujours rafle de six. Sangue di Bacco m'eccriai-je, les d\u00e9s sont pip\u00e9s; et ils l'\u00e9toient.\n\n\"Philosophes, quand je consid\u00e8re l'ordre toujours renissant de la nature, ses lois immuables, ses r\u00e9volutions toujours constantes dans une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 infinie; cette chance unique et conservatrice d'un univers tel que nous le voyons, qui revient sans cesse, malgr\u00e9 cent autres millions de chances de perturbation et de destruction possibles, je m'ecrie: certes la nature est pip\u00e9e!\"\n\nThe argument here stated strikes me as irresistible, nor ought it at all to weaken its effect, that it was spoken by the mouth of the Abb\u00e9 Galiani. Of this extraordinary person I shall have occasion afterwards to speak as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> economist.\n\n\u2020 Cic. de Nat. Deor. Lib. I. XXIV.\nWhatever his own professed principles may have been, this theory of the loaded die appears evidently, from the repeated allusions to it in his familiar correspondence, to have produced a very deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on his mind. (See Correspondance in\u00e9dite de l'Abb\u00e9 Galiani, &c. Vol. I. pp. 18, 42, 141, 142, \u00e0 Paris, 1818.)\n\nAs the old argument of the atomic atheists is plainly that on which the school of Diderot are still disposed to rest the strength of their cause, I shall make no apology for the length of this note. The sceptical suggestions on the same subject which occur in Mr Hume's Essay on the Idea of Necessary Connection, and which have given occasion to so much discussion in this country, do not seem to me to have ever produced any considerable impression on the French philosophers.\n\nNote (CC.) p. 133.\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Diderot, the author of the Spirit of Laws is entitled to particular notice, for the respect with which he always speaks of natural religion. A remarkable instance of this occurs in a letter to Dr Warburton, occasioned by the publication of his View of Bolingbroke's Philosophy. The letter, it must be owned, savours somewhat of the political religionist; but how fortunate would it have been for France, if, during its late revolutionary governments, such sentiments as those here expressed by Montesquieu had been more generally prevalent among his countrymen! \"Celui qui attaque la religion r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e n'attaque que la religion r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e; mais celui que attaque la religion naturelle attaque toutes les religions du monde.... Il n'est pas impossible d'attaquer une religion r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e, parce qu'elle existe par des faits particuliers, et que les faits par leur nature peuvent \u00eatre une mati\u00e8re de dispute; mais il n'en est pas de m\u00eame de la religion naturelle; elle est tir\u00e9e de la nature de l'homme, dont on ne peut pas disputer encore. J'ajoute \u00e0 ceci, quel peut \u00eatre le motif d'attaquer la religion r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e en Angleterre? On l'y a tellement purg\u00e9 de tout pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 destructeur qu'elle n'y peut faire de mal et qu'elle y peut faire, au contraire, une infinit\u00e9 de biens. Je sais, qu'un homme en Espagne ou en <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> que l'on va br\u00fbler, ou qui craint d'\u00eatre br\u00fbl\u00e9, parce qu'il ne croit point de certains articles d\u00e9pendans ou non de la religion r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e, a un juste sujet de l'attaquer, parce qu'il peut avoir quelque esp\u00e9rance de pourvoir \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense naturelle: mais il n'en est pas de m\u00eame en Angleterre, o\u00f9 tout homme qui attaque la religion r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e l'attaque sans int\u00e9r\u00eat, et ou cet homme, quand il r\u00e9ussirait, quand m\u00eame il aurait raison dans le fond, ne ferait que d\u00e9truire une infinit\u00e9 de biens pratiques, pour \u00e9tablir une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 purement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a>.\" (For the whole letter, see the 4to edit. of Montesquieu's Works. Paris, 1788. Tome V. p. 391. Also Warburton's Works by Hurd, Vol. VII. p. 553. London, 1758.)\n\nIn the foregoing passage, Montesquieu hints more explicitly than could well have been expected from a French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, at a consideration which ought always to be taken into the account, in judging of the works of his countrymen, when they touch on the subject of religion; I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, the corrupted and intolerant spirit of that system of faith which is immediately before their eyes. The eulogy bestowed on the church of England is particularly deserving of notice; and should serve as a caution to Protestant writers against making common cause with the defenders of the church of Rome.\n\nWith respect to Voltaire, who, amidst all his extravagancies and impieties, is well known to have declared open war against the principles maintained in the Syst\u00e8me de la Nature, it is remarked by Madame de Sta\u00ebl, that two different epochs may be distinguished in his literary life; the one,\nwhile his mind was warm from the philosophical lessons he had imbibed in England; the other, after it became infected with those extravagant principles which, soon after his death, brought a temporary reproach on the name of Philosophy. As the observation is extended by the very ingenious writer to the French nation in general, and draws a line between two classes of authors who are frequently confounded together in this country, I shall transcribe it in her own words.\n\n\"Il me semble qu'on pourrait marquer dans le dix-huiti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, en France, deux \u00e9poques parfaitement distinctes, celle dans laquelle l'influence de l'Angleterre s'est fait sentir, et celle o\u00f9 les esprits se sont pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9s dans la destruction: Alors les lumi\u00e8res se sont chang\u00e9es en incendie, et la philosophie, magicienne irrit\u00e9e, a consum\u00e9 le palais o\u00f9 elle avait \u00e9tal\u00e9 ses prodiges.\n\n\"En politique, Montesquieu appartient \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9poque, Raynal \u00e0 la seconde; en religion, les \u00e9crits de Voltaire, qui avait la tol\u00e9rance pour but, sont inspir\u00e9s par l'esprit de la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 du si\u00e8cle; mais sa mis\u00e9rable et vaniteuse irr\u00e9ligion a fl\u00e9tri la seconde.\" (De l'Allemagne, Tome III. pp. 37, 38.)\n\nNothing, in truth, can be more striking than the contrast between the spirit of Voltaire's early and of his later productions. From the former may be quoted some of the sublimest sentiments anywhere to be found, both of religion and of morality. In some of the latter, he appears irrecoverably sunk in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of fatalism. Examples of both are so numerous, that one is at a loss in the selection. In making choice of the following, I am guided chiefly by the comparative shortness of the passages.\n\n\"Consulte Zoroastre et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOS\">Minos</a>, et Solon,\nEt le sage Socrate, et le grand Cic\u00e9ron:\nIls ont ador\u00e9 tous un ma\u00eetre, un juge, un p\u00e8re;\nCe syst\u00e8me sublime \u00e0 l'homme est n\u00e9cessaire.\nC'est le sacr\u00e9 lien de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9,\nLe premier fondement de la sainte \u00e9quit\u00e9;\nLe frein du sc\u00e9l\u00e9rat, l'esp\u00e9rance du juste.\nSi les cieux d\u00e9pourvus de leur empreinte auguste\nPouvaient cesser jamais de le manifester,\nSi Dieu n'existait pas, il faudroit l'inventer.\"\n\nNor is it only on this fundamental principle of religion that Voltaire, in his better days, delighted to enlarge. The existence of a natural law engraved on the human heart, and the liberty of the human will, are subjects which he has repeatedly enforced and adorned with all his philosophical and poetical powers. What can be more explicit, or more forcible, than the following exposition of the inconsistencies of fatalism?\n\n\"Vois de la libert\u00e9 cet ennemi mutin,\nAveugle partisan d'un aveugle destin;\nEntends comme il consulte, approuve, ou d\u00e9lib\u00e8re,\nEntends de quel reproche il couvre un adversaire,\nVois comment d'un rival il cherche \u00e0 se venger,\nComme il punit son fils, et le veut corriger.\n\n1 A thought approaching very nearly to this occurs in one of Tillotson's Sermons. \"The being of God is so comfortable, so convenient, so necessary to the felicity of Mankind, that (as Tully admirably says), Dil immortales ad usum hominum fabricati penes vidantur.\u2014If God were not a necessary being of himself, he might almost be said to be made for the use and benefit of Man.\" For some ingenious remarks on this quotation from Cicero, see Jortin's Tracts, Vol. I. p. 371.\nThis very system, however, which Voltaire has here so severely reprobated, he lived to avow as\nthe creed of his more advanced years. The words, indeed, are put into the mouth of a fictitious\npersonage; but it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the writer meant to be understood as speaking his own sentiments.\n\"Je vois une cha\u00eene immense, dont tout est cha\u00eenon; elle embrasse, elle serre aujourd'hui la na-\nture,\" &c. &c.\n\n\"Je suis donc ramen\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 moi \u00e0 cette ancienne id\u00e9e, que je vois \u00eatre la base de tous les sys-\nt\u00e8mes, dans laquelle tous les philosophes retombent apr\u00e8s mille d\u00e9tours, et qui m'est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par\ntoutes les actions des hommes, par les miennes, par tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements que j'ai lus, que j'ai vus, et\naux-elles j'ai eu part; c'est le Fatalisme, c'est la N\u00e9cessit\u00e9 dont je vous ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9.\" (Lettres\nde Memmius \u00e0 Ciceron. See \u0152uvres de Voltaire, M\u00e9langes, Tome IV. p. 358. 4to. Edit.\nGen\u00e8ve, 1771.)\n\nNotwithstanding, however, this change in Voltaire's philosophical opinions, he continued to the\nlast his zealous opposition to atheism. But in what respects it is more pernicious than fatalism,\nit is not easy to discover.\n\nA reflection of La Harpe's, occasioned by some strictures of Voltaire's upon Montesquieu, ap-\nplies with equal force to the numberless inconsistencies which occur in his metaphysical specula-\ntions: \"Les objets de m\u00e9ditation \u00e9toient trop \u00e9trangers \u00e0 l'excessive vivacit\u00e9 de son esprit. Saisir\nfortement par l'imagination les objets qu'elle ne doit montrer que d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, c'est ce qui est du\nPoete; les embrasser sous toutes les faces, c'est ce qui est du Philosophe, et Voltaire \u00e9toit trop\nexclusivement l'un pour \u00eatre l'autre.\" (Cours de Litterat. Tome XV. pp. 46, 47.)\n\nA late author has very justly reprobated that spiritual deification of nature which has been\nlong fashionable among the French; and which, according to his own account, is at present not\nunfashionable in Germany. It is proper, however, to observe, that this mode of speaking has\nbeen used by two very different classes of writers; by the one with an intention to keep as much\nas possible the Deity out of their view, while studying his works; by the other, as a convenient\nand well understood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>, by means of which the frequent and irreverent mention of the\nname of God is avoided in philosophical arguments. It was with this last view, undoubtedly, that\nit was so often employed by Newton, and other English philosophers of the same school. In ge-\nneral, when we find a writer speaking of the wise or of the benevolent intentions of nature, we\nshould be slow in imputing to him any leaning towards atheism. Many of the finest instances of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">Final</a> Causes, it is certain, which the eighteenth century has brought to light, have been first re-\nmarked by inquirers who seem to have been fond of this phraseology; and of these inquirers, it is\npossible that some would have been less forward in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> testimony to the truth, had they been\nforced to avail themselves of the style of theologians. These speculations, therefore, concerning\nthe intentions or designs of Nature, how reprehensible soever and even absurd in point of strict\n\n---\n\n1 See the Diet. Philosophique, Art.

Lectures on the History of Literature. Vol. II. p. 109. (Edinburgh, 1816.)\nlogic the language may be in which they are expressed, may often be, nay, have often been, a step towards something higher and better; and, at any rate, are of a character totally different from the blind chance of the Epicureans, or the conflicting principles of the Manicheans.\n\nNote (DD.) p. 153.\n\n\"In the attempt, indeed, which Kant has made to enumerate the general ideas which are not derived from experience, but arise out of the pure understanding, Kant may well lay claim to the praise of originality.\" The object of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> is thus stated by his friend, Mr Schulze, the author of the Synopsis formerly quoted. (The following translation is by Dr Willich, Elements, &c. p. 45.)\n\n\"To investigate the whole store of original notions discoverable in our understanding, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at the foundation of all our knowledge; and at the same time to authenticate their true descent, by showing that they are not derived from experience, but are pure productions of the understanding.\n\n\"1. The perceptions of objects contain, indeed, the matter of knowledge, but are in themselves blind and dead, and not knowledge; and our soul is merely passive in regard to them.\n\n\"2. If these perceptions are to furnish knowledge, the understanding must think of them, and this is possible only through notions (conceptions), which are the peculiar form of our understanding, in the same manner as space and time are the form of our sensitive faculty.\n\n\"3. These notions are active representations of our understanding-faculty; and as they regard immediately the perceptions of objects, they refer to the objects themselves only mediately.\n\n\"4. They lie in our understanding as pure notions a priori, at the foundation of all our knowledge. They are necessary forms, radical notions, categories (predicaments), of which all our knowledge of them must be compounded: And the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of them follows.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">Quantity</a>; unity, plurality, totality.\n\"Quality; reality, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>, limitation.\n\"Relation; substance, cause, reciprocation.\n\"Modality; possibility, existence, necessity.\n\n\"5. Now, to think and to judge is the same thing; consequently, every notion contains a particular form of judgment concerning objects. There are four principal genera of judgments: They are derived from the above four possible functions of the understanding, each of which contains under it three species; namely, with respect to\n\n\"Quantity, they are universal, particular, singular judgments:\n\"Quality, they are affirmative, negative, infinite judgments.\n\"Relation, they are categorical, hypothetical, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISJUNCTIVE\">disjunctive</a> judgments.\n\"Modality, they are problematical, assertory, apodictical judgments.\"\n\nThese tables speak for themselves without any comment.\n\nNote (EE.) p. 154.\n\nKant's notions of Time are contained in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> propositions: \"1. Idea temporis non oritur sed supponitur a sensibus. 2. Idea temporis est singularis, non generalis. Tempus enim\nquodlibet non cogitatur, nisi tanquam pars unius ejusdem temporis immensi. 3. Idea itaque temporis est intuitus, et quoniam ante omnem sensationem concipiatur, tanquam conditio respectuum in sensilibus obviorum, est intuitus, non sensualis, sed purus. 4. Tempus est quantum continuum et legum continui in mutationibus universi principium. 5. Tempus non est objectivum aliquid et reale, nec substantia, nec accidens, nec relatio, sed subjectiva conditio, per naturam mentis humanae necessaria, quaelibet sensibilia, certa lege sibi co-ordinandi, et intuitus purus. 6. Tempus est conceptus verissimus, et, per omnia possibilis sensuum objecta, in infinitum patens, intuitivae representationis conditio. 7. Tempus itaque est principium formale mundi sensibilis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> primum.\"\n\nWith respect to Space, Kant states a series of similar propositions, ascribing to it very nearly the same metaphysical attributes as to Time, and running as far as possible a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> between them. \"A. Conceptus spatii non abstrahitur a sensationibus externis. B. Conceptus spatii est singularis representatione omnia in se comprehendens, non sub se continens notio abstracta et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNIS\">communis</a>. C. Conceptus spatii itaque est intuitus purus; cum sit conceptus singularis; sensationibus non confusatus, sed omnis sensationis externe forma fundamentalis. D. Spatium non est aliiquid objectivi et realis, nec substantia, nec accidens, nec relatio; sed subjectivum et ideale, e natura mentis stabili lege proficiscens, veluti schema, omnia omnino externe sensa sibi co-ordinandi. E. Quanquam conceptus spatii, ut objectivi aliquis et realis entis vel affectionis, sit imaginarius, nihil tamen secus respective ad sensibilia quacunque, non solum est verissimus, sed et omnis veritatis in sensualitate externa fundamentum.\"\n\nThese propositions are extracted from a Dissertation written by Kant himself in the Latin language. Their obscurity, therefore, cannot be ascribed to any misapprehension on the part of a translator. It was on this account that I thought it better to quote them in his own unaltered words, than to avail myself of the corresponding passage in Born's Latin version of the Critique of Pure Reason.\n\nTo each of Kant's propositions concerning Time and Space I shall subjoin a short comment, following the same order in which these propositions are arranged above.\n\n1. That the idea of Time has no resemblance to any of our sensations, and that it is, therefore, not derived from sensation immediately and directly, has been very often observed; and, if nobody had ever observed it, the fact is so very obvious, that the enunciation of it could not entitle the author to the praise of much ingenuity. Whether \"this idea be supposed in all our sensations,\" or (as Kant explains himself more clearly in his third proposition) \"be conceived by the mind prior to all sensation,\" is a question which seems to me at least doubtful; nor do I think the opinion we form concerning it a matter of the smallest importance. One thing is certain, that this idea is an inseparable concomitant of every act of memory with respect to past events; and that, in whatever way it is acquired, we are irresistibly led to ascribe to the thing itself an existence independent of the will of any being whatever.\n\n2. On the second proposition I have nothing to remark. The following is the most intelligible translation of it that I can give. \"The idea of Time is singular, not general; for any particular length of Time can be conceived only as a part of one and the same immense whole.\"\n\n3. From these premises (such as they are) Kant concludes, that the idea of Time is intuitive; and that this intuition, being prior to the exercise of the senses, is not empirical but pure. The\n\n---\n\n1 De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis forma et principiis. Dissertatio pro loco professionis Log. et Metaph. Ordinariae rite sibi Vindicando; quam exigentibus statutis Academicis publice tuebitur IMMANUEL KANT.\u2014Regiomonti, 1770.\nconclusion here must necessarily partake of the uncertainty of the premises from which it is drawn but the meaning of the author does not seem to imply any very erroneous principle. It amounts, indeed, to little more than an explanation of some of his peculiar terms.\n\n4. That Time is a continued quantity is indisputable. To the latter clause of the sentence I can annex no meaning but this, that time enters as an essential element into our conception of the law of continuity, in all its various applications to the changes that take place in Nature.\n\n5. In this proposition Kant assumes the truth of that much contested, and, to me, incomprehensible doctrine, which denies the objective reality of time. He seems to consider it merely as a subjective condition, inseparably connected with the frame of the Human Mind, in consequence of which it arranges sensible phenomena, according to a certain law, in the order of succession.\n\n6. What is meant by calling Time a true conception, I do not profess to understand; nor am I able to interpret the remainder of the sentence in any way but this, that we can find no limits to the range thus opened in our conceptions to the succession of sensible events.\n\n7. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that Time is \"absolutely the first formal principle of the sensible world.\" I can annex no meaning to this; but I have translated the original, word for word, and shall leave my readers to their own conjectures.\n\nA. It appears from this, that, in the opinion of Kant, the idea of Space is connate with the mind, or, at least, that it is prior to any information received from the senses. But this doctrine seems to me not a little doubtful. Indeed, I rather lean to the common theory, which supposes our first ideas of Space or Extension to be formed by abstracting this attribute from the other qualities of matter. The idea of Space, however, in whatever manner formed, is manifestly accompanied with an irresistible conviction, that Space is necessarily existent, and that its annihilation is impossible; nay, it appears to me to be also accompanied with an irresistible conviction, that Space cannot possibly be extended in more than three dimensions. Call either of these propositions in question, and you open a door to universal scepticism.\n\nB. I can extract no meaning from this, but the nugatory proposition, that our conception of Space leads us to consider it as the place in which all things are comprehended.\n\nC. \"The conception of Space, therefore, is a pure intuition.\" This follows as a necessary corollary (according to Kant's own definition) from Prop. A. What is to be understood by the clause which asserts, that Space is the fundamental form of every external sensation, it is not easy to conjecture. Does it imply merely that the conception of Space is necessarily involved in all our notions of things external? In this case, it only repeats over, in different and most inaccurate terms, the last clause of Prop. B. What can be more loose and illogical than the phrase external sensation?\n\nD. That Space is neither a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation, may be safely granted; but does it follow from this that it is nothing objective, or, in other words, that it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> creature of the imagination? This, however, would seem to be the idea of Kant; and yet I cannot reconcile it with what he says in Prop. E., that the conception of Space is the foundation of all the truth we ascribe to our perceptions of external objects. (The author's own words are\u2014omnis veritatis in sensualitate externa fundamentum!)\n\n1 Mr Nitch has remarked this difficulty, and has attempted to remove it. \"The most essential objection (he observes) to Kant's system is, that it leads to scepticism; because it maintains, that the figures in which we see the external objects clothed are not in-\nUpon the whole, it appears to me, that, among these various propositions, there are some which are quite unintelligible; that others assume, as first principles, doctrines which have been disputed by many of our most eminent philosophers; that others, again, seem to aim at involving plain and obvious truths in darkness and mystery; and that not one is expressed with the simplicity and precision which are the natural results of clear and accurate thinking. In considering time and space as the forms of all sensible phenomena, does Kant mean anything more but this,\u2014that we necessarily refer every sensible phenomenon to some point of space, or to some instant of time? If this was really his meaning, he has only repeated over, in obscurer language, the following propositions of Newton: \"Ut ordo partium temporis est immutabilis, sic etiam ordo partium spatii. Moveatur hic de locis suis, et movebuntur (at ita dicam) de seipsis. Nam tempora et spatia sunt sui ipsorum et rerum omnium quasi loca. In tempore, quoad ordinem successionis; in spatio, quoad ordinem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SITUS\">situs</a> locantur universa. De illorum essentia est ut sint loca: et loca primaria moveri absurdam est.\"\n\nI have quoted this passage, not from any desire of displaying the superiority of Newton over Kant, but chiefly to show how very nearly the powers of the former sink to the same level with those of the latter, when directed to inquiries unfathomable by the human faculties. What abuse of words can be greater than to say, That neither the parts of time nor the parts of space can be moved from their places? In the Principia of Newton, however, this incidental discussion is but a spot on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. In the Critique of Pure Reason, it is a fair specimen of the rest of the work, and forms one of the chief pillars of the whole system, both metaphysical and moral.\n\nNote (FF.) p. 155.\n\nThe following quotation will account for the references which I have made to Mr Nitsch among the expounders of Kant's Philosophy. It will also serve to show that the Critique of Pure Reason has still some admirers in England, not less enthusiastic than those it had formerly in Germany.\n\n\"In submitting this fourth Treatise on the Philosophy of Kant to the reader\" (says the author of these articles in the Encyclopaedia Londinensis), \"I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of publicly acknowledging the great assistance which I have derived in my literary pursuits, from my excellent and highly valued friend Mr Henry Richter. To him I am indebted for the clearness and perspicuity with which the thoughts of the immortal Kant have been conveyed to the public. Indeed, his comprehensive knowledge of the system, as well as his enthusiastic admiration of its general truth, render him a most able and desirable co-operator. Should, therefore, any good result to mankind from our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> labours in the display of this vast and profound system, he is justly entitled to his share of the praise. It is with sincere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> that I reflect upon that period, now\n\nberent in those objects, and that consequently space is something within, and not without the mind.\" (pp. 144, 145.) \"It may be farther objected (he adds), that, if there be no external space, there is also no external world. But this is concluding by far too much from these premises. If there be no external space, it will follow, that we are not authorized to assign extension to external things, but there will follow no more.\" (p. 149.) Mr Nitsch then proceeds to obviate these objections; but his reply is far from satisfactory, and is indeed not less applicable to the doctrine of Berkeley than to that of Kant. This point, however, I do not mean to argue here. The concessions which Nitsch has made are quite sufficient for my present purpose. They serve at least to satisfy my own mind, that I have not misrepresented Kant's meaning.\n\nWas it not to avoid the palpable incongruity of this language that Kant was led to substitute the word forms instead of places; the former word not seeming to be so obviously inapplicable as the latter to time and space in common; or, to speak more correctly, being, from its extreme vagueness, equally unmeaning when applied to both?\n\nDiss. I. Part II.\ntwo and twenty years ago, when we first studied together under the same master, Frederic Augustus Nitsch, who originally imported the seeds of Transcendental Philosophy from its native country, to plant them in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; and though, as is usually the case, many of those seeds were scattered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, I trust that a sufficient number have taken root to maintain the growth of this vigorous and flourishing plant, till the time shall come, when, by its general cultivation, England may be enabled to enrich other nations with the most perfect specimens of its produce. Professor Nitsch, who thus bestowed upon our country her first attainments in the department of Pure Science, has paid the debt of nature. I confess it is some reflection upon England, that she did not foster and protect this immediate disciple of the father of philosophy; but the necessities of this learned and illustrious man unfortunately compelled him to seek that subsistence elsewhere, which was withheld from him here. At Rostock, about the year 1813, this valuable member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and perfect master of the philosophy he undertook to teach, entered upon his immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> as a reward for his earthly services. It is with the most heartfelt satisfaction that I add my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MITE\">mite</a> of praise to his revered memory. But for him, I might ever have remained in the dark regions of sophistry and uncertainty.\"\n\nNote (GG.) p. 164:\n\nAmong the secondary mischiefs resulting from the temporary popularity of Kant, none is more to be regretted than the influence of his works on the habits, both of thinking and of writing, of some very eminent men, who have since given to the world histories of philosophy. That of Tennenman in particular (a work said to possess great merit) would appear to have been vitiated by this unfortunate bias in the views of its author. A very competent judge has lately said of it, that \"it affords, as far as it is completed, the most accurate, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and the most rational view we yet possess of the different systems of philosophy; but that the critical philosophy being chosen as the vantage ground from whence the survey of former systems is taken, the continual reference in Kant's own language to his peculiar doctrines, renders it frequently impossible for those who have not studied the dark works of this modern Heraclitus to understand the strictures of the historian on the systems even of Aristotle or Plato.\" (See the article Brucker in this Supplement.) We are told by the same writer, that \"among the learned of Germany, Brucker has never enjoyed a very distinguished reputation.\" This I can very easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>; but I am more inclined to interpret it to the disadvantage of the German taste, than to that of the historian. Brucker is indeed not distinguished by any extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of depth or of acuteness; but in industry, fidelity, and sound judgment, he has few superiors; qualities of infinitely greater value in the undertaker of a historical work, than that passion for systematical refinement, which is so apt to betray the best-intentioned writers into false glosses on the opinions they record.\n\nWhen the above passage was written, I had not seen the work of Buhle. I have since had an opportunity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> into the French translation of it, published at Paris in 1816; and I must frankly acknowledge, that I have seldom met with a greater disappointment. The account there given of the Kantian system, to which I turned with peculiar eagerness, has, if possible, involved to my apprehension, in additional obscurity, that mysterious doctrine. From this, however, I did not feel myself entitled to form an estimate of the author's merits as a philosophical historian, till I had read some other articles of which I considered myself as better qualified to judge.\nThe following short extract will, without the aid of any comment, enable such of my readers as know anything of the literary history of Scotland, to form an opinion upon this point for themselves.\n\n\"Reid n'attaqua les syst\u00e8mes de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs et notamment celui de Hume, que parce qu'il se croyait convaincu de leur d\u00e9faut de fondement. Mais un autre antagoniste, non moins c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, du scepticisme de Hume, fut, en outre, guid\u00e9 par la haine qu'il avait vou\u00e9e \u00e0 son illustre compatriote, lequel lui r\u00e9pondit avec beaucoup d'aigreur et d'animosit\u00e9. James Beattie, professeur de morale \u00e0 Edimbourg, puis ensuite, de logique et de morale \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 d'Aberdeen, obtint la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur Hume lorsqu'il fut question de remplir la chaire vacante \u00e0 Edimbourg. Cette circonstance devint sans doute la principale source de l'inimiti\u00e9 que les deux savans con\u00e7urent l'un pour l'autre, et qui influa m\u00eame sur le ton qu'ils employ\u00e8rent dans les raisonnements par lesquels ils se combattirent.\" (Tome V. p. 235.)\n\nTo this quotation may I be pardoned for adding a few sentences relative to myself? \"L'ouvrage de Dugald Stewart, intitul\u00e9, Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, est un syncr\u00e9tisme des opinions de Hartley et de Reid. Stewart borne absolument la connaissance, tant de l'\u00e2me que des choses ext\u00e9rieures, \u00e0 ce que le sens commun nous en apprend, et croit pouvoir ainsi mettre l'\u00e9tude de la m\u00e9taphysique \u00e0 l'abri du reproche de rouler sur des choses qui d\u00e9passent la sph\u00e8re de notre intelligence, ou qui sont tout-\u00e0-fait inutiles dans la pratique de la vie. Les chapitres suivants renferment le d\u00e9veloppement du principe de l'association des id\u00e9es. Ils sont presque enti\u00e8rement \u00e9crits d'apr\u00e8s Hartley. Stewart fait d\u00e9river de ce principe toutes les facult\u00e9s intellectuelles et pratiques de l'homme.\" (Tom. V. pp. 330, 331.)\n\nOf the discrimination displayed by Buhle in the classification of systems and of authors, the title prefixed to his 19th chapter may serve as a specimen: \"Philosophy of Condillac, of Helvetius, of Baron d'Holbach, of Robinet, of Bonnet, of Montesquieu, of Burlamaqui, of Vattel, and of Reid.\"\n\nBut the radical defect of Buhle's work is, the almost total want of references to original authors. We are presented only with the general results of the author's reading, without any guide to assist us in confirming his conclusions when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, or in correcting them when wrong. This circumstance is of itself sufficient to annihilate the value of any historical composition.\n\nSismondi, in mentioning the history of modern literature by Bouterwek, takes occasion to pay a compliment (and, I have no doubt, a very deserved one) to German scholars in general; observing, that he has executed his task\u2014\"avec une \u00e9tendue d'\u00e9rudition, et une loyaut\u00e9 dans la mani\u00e8re d'en faire profiter ses lecteurs, qui semblent propres aux savans Allemands.\" (De la Litt. du Midi de l'Europe, Tom. I. p. 13, \u00e0 Paris, 1813.) I regret that my ignorance of the German language has prevented me from profiting by a work of which Sismondi has expressed so favourable an opinion; and still more, that the only history of philosophy from the pen of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> German scholar, which I have had access to consult, should form so remarkable an exception to Sismondi's observation.\n\nThe contents of the preceding note lay me under the necessity, in justice to myself, of taking some notice of the following remark on the first part of this Dissertation, by an anonymous critic. (See Quarterly Review, Vol. XVII. p. 42.)\n\n\"In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which Mr Stewart has adopted, if he has not consulted his strength, he has at least consulted his ease; for, supposing a person to have the requisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> and information, the task which our author has performed, is one which, with the historical abstracts of Buhle or Tenne-man, cannot be supposed to have required any very laborious meditation.\"\nOn the insinuation contained in the foregoing passage, I abstain from offering any comment. I have only to say, that it is now, for the first time (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">Summer</a> of 1820), that I have seen the work of Bubl\u00e9; and that I have never yet had an opportunity of seeing that of Tenneman. From what I have found in the one, and from what I have heard of the other, I am strongly inclined to suspect, that when the anonymous critic wrote the above sentence, he was not less ignorant than myself of the works of these two historians. Nor can I refrain from adding (which I do with perfect confidence), that no person competent to judge on such a subject can read with attention this Historical Sketch, without perceiving that its merits and defects, whatever they may be, are at least all my own.\n\nNote (HH.) p. 168.\n\nOf the Scottish authors who turned their attention to metaphysical studies, prior to the Union of the two Kingdoms, I know of none so eminent as George Dalgarno of Aberdeen, author of two works, both of them strongly marked with sound philosophy, as well as with original genius. The one published at London, 1660, is entitled, \"Ars signorum, vulgo character universalis et lingua philosophica, qua poterunt, homines diversissimorum idiomatum, spatio duarum septimanarum, omnia animi sui sensu (in rebus familiaribus) non minus intelligibiliter, sive scribendo, sive loquendo, mutuo communicare, quam linguis propriis vernacularis.\" Pratera, hinc etiam poterunt juvenes, philosophiae principia, et veram logicam praxin, citius et facilius multo imbibere, quam ex vulgaribus philosophorum scriptis.\" The other work of Dalgarno is entitled, \"Didascalocophus, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAF_AND_DUMB\">Deaf and Dumb</a> Man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">Tutor</a>.\" Printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, 1680. I have given some account of the former in the notes at the end of the first volume of the Philosophy of the Human Mind; and of the latter, in a Memoir, published in Vol. VII. of the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Society of Edinburgh. As they are now become extremely rare, and would together form a very small octavo volume, I cannot help thinking that a bookseller, who should reprint them, would be fully indemnified by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. The fate of Dalgarno will be hard, indeed, if, in addition to the unjust neglect he experienced from his contemporaries, the proofs he has left of his philosophical talents shall be suffered to sink into total oblivion.\n\nLord Stair's Physiologia Nova Experimentalis (published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> in 1686) is also worthy of notice in the literary history of Scotland. Although it bears few marks of the eminent talents which distinguished the author, both as a lawyer and as a statesman, it discovers a very extensive acquaintance with the metaphysical as well as with the physical doctrines, which were chiefly in vogue at that period; more particularly with the leading doctrines of Gassendi, Descartes, and Malebranche. Many acute and some important strictures are made on the errors of all the three, and at the same time complete justice is done to their merits; the writer every where manifesting an independence of opinion and a spirit of free inquiry, very uncommon among the philosophers of the seventeenth century. The work is dedicated to the Royal Society of London, of the utility of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, in promoting experimental knowledge, he appears to have been fully aware.\n\nThe limits of a note will not permit me to enter into farther details concerning the state of philosophy in Scotland, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the Union of the Crowns and that of the Kingdoms. The circumstances of the country were indeed peculiarly unfavourable to it. But memorials still exist of a few individuals, sufficient to show, that the philosophical taste, which has so remarkably distinguished our countrymen during the eighteenth century, was in some measure an inheritance from their immediate predecessors. Leibnitz, I think, somewhere mentions the number of learned\nScotchmen by whom he was visited in the course of their travels. To one of them (Mr Burnet of Kemney) he has addressed a most interesting letter, dated in 1697, on the general state of learning and science in Europe; opening his mind on the various topics which he introduces, with a freedom and confidence highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to the attainments and character of his correspondent. Dr Arbuthnot, who was born about the time of the Restoration, may serve as a fair specimen of the very liberal education which was then to be had in some of the Scottish Universities. The large share which he is allowed to have contributed to the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus abundantly attests the variety of his learning, and the just estimate he had formed of the philosophy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>; and in one or two passages, where he glances at the errors of his contemporaries, an attentive and intelligent reader will trace, amid all his pleasantry, a metaphysical depth and soundness which seem to belong to a later period.\u2014Is there no Arbuthnot now, to chastise the follies of our craniologists?\n\nNote (II.) p. 184.\n\nThe letter which gives occasion to this note was written twenty years after the publication of the Treatise of Human Nature. As it relates, however, to the history of Mr Hume's studies previous to that publication, I consider this as the proper place for introducing it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALOGUE\">Dialogue</a> to which the letter refers was plainly that which appeared after Mr Hume's death, under the title of Dialogues on Natural Religion.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nNinewells, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 19, 1751.\n\n\"You would perceive by the sample I have given you, that I make Cleanthes the hero of the dialogue. Whatever you can think of to strengthen that side of the argument will be most acceptable to me. Any propensity you imagine I have to the other side crept in upon me against my will; and it is not long ago that I burned an old manuscript book, wrote before I was twenty, which contained, page after page, the gradual progress of my thoughts on that head. It begun with an anxious search after arguments to confirm the common opinion; doubts stole in, dissipated, returned, were again dissipated, returned again, and it was a perpetual struggle of a restless imagination against inclination, perhaps against reason.\n\n\"I have often thought that the best way of composing a dialogue would be for two persons that are of different opinions about any question of importance, to write alternately the different parts of the discourse, and reply to each other. By this means that vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> would be avoided of putting nothing but nonsense into the mouth of the adversary; and, at the same time, a variety of character and genius being upheld, would make the whole look more natural and unaffected. Had it been my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to live near you, I should have taken on me the character of Philo in the dialogue, which you'll own I could have supported naturally enough; and you would not have been averse to that of Cleanthes. I believe, too, we could both of us have kept our tempers very well; only you have not reached an absolute philosophical indifference on these points. What danger can ever come from ingenious reasoning and inquiry? The worst speculative sceptic ever I knew was a much better man than the best superstitious devotee and bigot. I must inform you, too, that this was the way of thinking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> on this subject. If a man made profession of philosophy, whatever his sect was, they always expected to find more regularity in his life and manners than in those of the ignorant and illiterate. There is a remarkable pas-\nsage of Appian to this purpose. That historian observes, that, notwithstanding the established prepossession in favour of learning, yet some philosophers who have been trusted with absolute power have very much abused it; and he instances in Critias, the most violent of the Thirty, and Aristion who governed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> in the time of Sylla. But I find, upon inquiry, that Critias was a professed Atheist, and Aristion an Epicurean, which is little or nothing different; and yet Appian wonders at their corruption as much as if they had been Stoics or Platonists. A modern zealot would have thought that corruption unavoidable.\n\n\"I could wish that Cleanthes's argument could be so analyzed as to be rendered quite formal and regular. The propensity of the mind towards it, unless that propensity were as strong and universal as that to believe in our senses and experience, will still, I am afraid, be esteemed a suspicious foundation. 'Tis here I wish for your assistance. We must endeavour to prove that this propensity is somewhat different from our inclination to find our own figures in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, our face in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, our passions and sentiments even in inanimate matter. Such an inclination may and ought to be controlled, and can never be a legitimate ground of assent.\n\n\"The instances I have chosen for Cleanthes are, I hope, tolerably happy; and the confusion in which I represent the sceptic seems natural. But, si quid novisti rectius, &c.\n\n\"You ask me, if the idea of cause and effect is nothing but vicinity? (you should have said constant vicinity or regular conjunction)\u2014I would gladly know whence is that further idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a> against which you argue? The question is pertinent; but I hope I have answered it. We feel, after the constant conjunction, an easy transition from one idea to the other, or a connection in the imagination; and, as it is usual for us to transfer our own feelings to the objects on which they are dependant, we attach the internal sentiment to the external objects. If no single instances of cause and effect appear to have any connection, but only repeated similar ones, you will find yourself obliged to have recourse to this theory.\n\n\"I am sorry our correspondence should lead us into these abstract speculations. I have thought, and read, and composed very little on such questions of late. Morals, politics, and literature, have employed all my time; but still the other topics I must think more curious, important, entertaining, and useful, than any geometry that is deeper than Euclid. If, in order to answer the doubts started, new principles of philosophy must be laid, are not these doubts themselves very useful? Are they not preferable to blind and ignorant assent? I hope I can answer my own doubts: but, if I could not, is it to be wondered at? To give myself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> and speak magnificently; might I not observe that Columbus did not conquer empires and plant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>?\n\n\"If I have not unravelled the knot so well in these last papers I sent you, as perhaps I did in the former, it has not, I assure you, proceeded from want of good will. But some subjects are easier than others; and sometimes one is happier in one's researches and inquiries than at other times. Still I have recourse to the si quid novisti rectius; not in order to pay you a compliment, but from a real philosophical doubt and curiosity.\"\n\nAn unfinished draught of the letter, to which the foregoing seems to have been the reply, has been preserved among Sir Gilbert Elliot's papers. This careless fragment is in his own handwriting, and exhibits an interesting specimen of the progress made in Scotland among the higher classes, seventy years ago, not only in sound philosophy, but in purity of English style.\n\n1 The original is in the possession of the Earl of Minto.\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nInclosed I return your papers, which, since my coming to town, I have again read over with the greatest care. The thoughts which this last perusal of them has suggested I shall set down, merely in compliance with your desire, for I pretend not to say anything new upon a question which has already been examined so often and so accurately. I must freely own to you, that to me it appears extremely doubtful, if the position which Cleanthes undertakes to maintain can be supported, at least in any satisfactory manner, upon the principles he establishes and the concessions he makes. If it be only from effects exactly similar that experience warrants us to infer a similar cause, then I am afraid it must be granted, that the works of Nature resemble not so nearly the productions of man as to support the conclusion which Cleanthes admits can be built only on that resemblance. The two instances he brings to illustrate his argument are indeed ingenious and elegant; the first, especially, which seemingly carries great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> along with it: the other, I mean that of the Vegetating Library, as it is of more difficult apprehension, so I think it is not easy for the mind either to retain or to apply it. But, if I mistake not, this strong objection strikes equally against them both. Cleanthes does no more than substitute two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> instances in the place of natural ones: but if these bear no nearer a resemblance than natural ones to the effects which we have experienced to proceed from men, then nothing can justly be inferred from them; and if this resemblance be greater, then nothing farther ought to be inferred from them.\n\nIn one respect, however, Cleanthes seems to limit his reasonings more than is necessary even upon his own principles. Admitting, for once, that experience is the only source of our knowledge, I cannot see how it follows, that, to enable us to infer a similar cause, the effects must not only be similar, but exactly and precisely so. Will not experience authorize me to conclude, that a machine or piece of mechanism was produced by human art, unless I have happened previously to see a machine or piece of mechanism exactly of the same sort? Point out, for instance, the contrivance and end of a watch to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, who had never before seen anything more curious than the coarsest instruments of husbandry, will he not immediately conclude, that this watch is an effect produced by human art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>? And I would still farther ask, does a spade or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> much more resemble a watch than a watch does an organized animal? The result of our whole experience, if experience indeed be the only principle, seems rather to amount to this: There are but two ways in which we have ever observed the different parcels of matter to be thrown together; either at random, or with design and purpose. By the first, we have never seen produced a regular complicated effect, corresponding to a certain end; by the second, we uniformly have. If, then, the works of nature, and the productions of man, resemble each other in this one general characteristic, will not even experience sufficiently warrant us to ascribe to both a similar though proportionable cause? If you answer, that abstracting from the experience we acquire in this world, order and adjustment of parts is no proof of design, my reply is, that no conclusions, drawn from the nature of so chimerical a being as man, considered abstracted from experience, can at all be listened to. The principles of the human mind are clearly so contrived as not to unfold themselves till the proper objects and proper opportunity and occasion be presented. There is no arguing upon the nature of man but by considering him as grown to maturity, placed in society, and become acquainted with surrounding objects. But if you should still farther urge, that, with regard to instances of which we have no experience, for ought we know, matter may contain the principles of order, arrangement, and the adjustment of final causes, I should only answer, that whoever can conceive this proposition to be true, has exactly the same idea of matter that I have of mind. I know not if I have reasoned justly upon Cleanthes's prin-\nciples, nor is it indeed very material. The purpose of my letter is barely to point out what to me appears the fair and philosophical method of proceeding in this inquiry. That this universe is the effect of an intelligent designing cause, is a principle which has been most universally received in all ages and in all nations; the proof uniformly appealed to is, the admirable order and adjustment of the works of nature. To proceed, then, experimentally and philosophically, the first question in point of order seems to be, what is the effect which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the universe, and the several parts of it, produces upon a considering mind? This is a question of fact; a popular question, the discussion of which depends not upon refinements and subtlety, but merely upon impartiality and attention. I ask, then, what is the sentiment which prevails in one's mind, after having considered not only the more familiar objects that surround him, but also all the discoveries of Natural Philosophy and Natural History; after having considered not only the general economy of the universe, but also the most minute parts of it, and the amazing adjustment of means to ends with a precision unknown to human art, and in instances innumerable? Tell me (to use the words of Cleanthes), does not the idea of a Contriver flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation? Expressions how just! (yet in the mouth of Cleanthes you must allow me to doubt of their propriety.) Nor does this conviction only arise from the consideration of the inanimate parts of the creation, but still more strongly from the contemplation of the faculties of the understanding, the affections of the heart, and the various instincts discoverable both in men and brutes; all so properly adapted to the circumstances and situation both of the species and the individual. Yet this last observation, whatever may be in it, derives no force from experience. For who ever saw a mind produced? If we are desirous to push our experiments still farther, and inquire, whether the survey of the universe has regularly and uniformly led to the belief of an intelligent cause? Shall we not find, that, from the author of the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> to the preachers at Boyle's Lecture, the same language has been universally held? No writer, who has ever treated this subject, but has either applied himself to describe, in the most emphatical language, the beauty and order of the universe, or else to collect together and place in the most striking light, the many instances of contrivance and design which have been discovered by observation and experiment. And when they have done this, they seem to have imagined that their task was finished, and their demonstration complete; and indeed no wonder,\u2014for it seems to me, that we are scarce more assured of our own existence, than that this well-ordered universe is the effect of an intelligent cause.\n\n\"This first question, then, which is indeed a question of fact, being thus settled upon observations which are obvious and unrefined, but not on that account the less satisfactory, it becomes the business of the philosopher to inquire, whether the conviction arising from these observations be founded on the conclusions of reason, the reports of experience, or the dictates of feeling, or possibly upon all these together; but if his principles shall not be laid so wide as to account for the fact already established upon prior evidence, we may, I think, safely conclude, that his principles are erroneous. Should a philosopher pretend to demonstrate to me, by a system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, that I can only discern an object when placed directly opposite to my eye, I should certainly answer, your system must be defective, for it is contradicted by matter of fact.\"\nWhen this Dissertation was nearly ready for the press, the posthumous works of my late very learned, ingenious, and amiable friend, Dr Thomas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, were published. The contributions which the philosophy of the human mind owes to his talents and industry, belong exclusively to the literary history of the nineteenth century; and will, I doubt not, receive ample justice from the pens of some of his numerous pupils. On certain points on which we differed in opinion, more particularly on the philosophical merits of Lord Bacon and of Dr Reid, I should have been tempted to offer some additional explanations, if the circumstance of his recent and much lamented death had not imposed silence on me, upon all questions of controversy between us. The state of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, besides, has been such during the winter, that I have found the task of correcting the press more than sufficient to furnish employment both to my mind and body; and, in fact, I have been forced to deny myself the satisfaction of reading Dr Brown's Lectures, till my own performance shall be in the hands of the public.","sp":228,"ep":275},{"h":"PROGRESS OF METAPHYSICS DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">SECTION</a> I.\n\nHistorical and Critical Review of the Philosophical Works of Locke and Leibnitz.","sp":16,"ep":17},{"h":"PTEROPODA","t":"Fins formed of membranaceous expansions.\n\nM.

The fins are two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, seated on each side of the neck. When the animal swims, the head with the fins are protruded.\n\nThis genus was instituted by Cuvier, for the reception of the Clio helicina of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Phipps, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Argonauta arctica of Fabricius. According to Mr Scoresby, it is found in great quantities near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Spitzbergen.\n\nGenus, Hyalea.\u2014Posterior extremity of the body protected by two connected shelly valves.\n\nThe Hyalea tridentata, the best known species of the genus, was first noticed by Forskael, in his Descriptiones Animalium, p. 124, as an anomia, and inhabiting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>. The same species was likewise taken in abundance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, by the expedition under Captain Tuckey.\n\nII. Tunic Destitute of a Shell.\n\nA. Fins <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>.\n\nPosterior Extremity with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">Leaf</a>-like Ridges.\n\nGenus, Pneumodermon.\u2014Head with two bundles of tentacula.\n\nThe body is oval, with a narrow neck, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a> on each side. The mouth is nearly terminal, furnished on each side with a fleshy lip, and beneath, with a fleshy chin. The tentacula consist each of a filament, with a tubercle at the end, pierced by a small hole, and considered as exercising the office of a sucker. M. Cuvier has figured and described the only known species, which he terms Pneumodermon Peroni, the trivial name being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the discoverer, M. Peron.\n\nPosterior Extremity Simple.\n\nGenus, Clio.\u2014Body ovate, with the tunic elongated and membranaceous.\n\nThe head is divided into two lobes, the summits of which are furnished with tentacula. The existence of eyes has not been ascertained. The Clio Borealis, a native of the Arctic Seas, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of the genus.\n\nGenus, Cleodora.\u2014Body covered with a triangular pyramidal tunic.\n\nThe fins are membranaceous. The mouth is situated between them, and is furnished with a semicircular lip. This genus was instituted by Peron, for the reception of the Clio of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>. The C. pyramidata is the best ascertained species. Brown's Jamaica, p. 386, Tab. xliii. f. 1. Two other species were taken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a> expedition in S. Lat. 2\u00b0 14', and E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 9\u00b0 55'; and S. Lat. 2\u00b0 41' E. Long. 9\u00b0 16', \"both having a spinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> on each side of their shell, near its opening. One species is beautifully sulcated transversely, and the other but slightly so.\" Tuckey's Narrative, p. 412.\n\nB. Fin single.\n\nGenus, Cymbulia.\u2014Tunic cartilaginous and trough-shaped.\n\nThe fin is single, divided into three lobes, one of which is small, with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>. This genus was instituted by Peron, in Annales du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>, T. XV.

the illustrious historians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHAFFHAUSEN\">Schaffhausen</a> in 1752, of which town his father was a pastor. In 1769, he commenced his academical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> at G\u00f6ttingen, where he applied himself principally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and a profession which he soon deserted. In 1772, he was appointed professor of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> in the Gymnasium of his native town. In 1774, he removed to Geneva, where he principally resided till 1781. Here he delivered his lectures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, which were written originally in French; and here he formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and commenced the investigations towards his History of the Helvetic Confederacy. In 1781, he was called as professor of history to the Carolinum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>, an appointment which he soon abandoned; and, in 1782, he returned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. By Heyne's recommendation, he was, in 1786, called as Librarian, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Aulic Counsellor to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>. In 1800, he received the appointment of Librarian to the Imperial Library at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>; in 1804, was called as Historiographer and Counsellor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">War</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>; and, in 1807, was appointed Minister, Counsellor of State, and General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">Director</a> of Public Instruction in Cassel. Here he died in 1809.\n\nTo enter into any detail regarding the history of Mueller's life is here the less requisite, as there perhaps never existed an author whose internal character was more independent of outward circumstances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> in whom the writer was in a more remarkable manner distinguished from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; while, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, his writings breathe the whole energy of the deep feelings of his ardent disposition. An honest enthusiasm for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> was combined in him, with an ambition, which could be satisfied only with the renown of a great author. No exertion of intellect was for him too painful; no perseverance in industry surpassed his endurance. Of a cheerful disposition, even amid the adversities of life, he pursued without faltering his determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. From the letters which in his youth he wrote to his friend De Bonstetten, we see him at the beginning, the same as at the termination of his course. But this very con-\nsistency renders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> between the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> which he united in his person only the more remarkable. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> amiable, but soft even to weakness, open and liberal, though without one conspicuous trait of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, accommodating himself to circumstances with the pliability of a courtier, and yielding to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a> of his passions in a point where morality condemns him without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>: yet, no sooner had he seized his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>\u2014no sooner had he begun to narrate the great events of former times, than this man became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> at once in firmness and elevation; and this not by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, but from a genuine and restless enthusiasm in his own moral delineations. It then became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of his nature to think and to write as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he himself had been one of the mighty warriors or statesmen, to glorify whose names it was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> delight; now a Roman, now a Switzer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> time, and now some other illustrious personage, whose character he superinduced upon his own in the moment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> had indeed for him so strong a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a>, that he frequently deceived himself in his estimate of their amount.\n\nWith such a character of mind, Mueller could never be a historian who wrote only for the intellect, and still less a historian who wrote only for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. All that he read of remarkable persons and events became, in his imagination, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of animated pictures. He must represent and paint, and he painted with few strokes, and happily, as if from life; while truth, as far as this could be discovered by historical research, was of greater value in his eyes than all the ornaments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>. His imagination was only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> what he read before him in a living form. His historical delineations were inspired with the warmth of his peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, but not misrepresented. As he himself was animated by whatever was good, and generous, and great, so, too, he wished to animate his reader by a sympathy with his portraits, and through the instructions which history conveys. But in Mueller's view, history must be instructive in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of which few historians have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. His free and clear intellect, adhering to no philosophical system, and with little inclination towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> sciences in general, but penetrating deeply into the internal connection of historical events, was able to extract from this connection political and moral principles, which, though manifest even to the unlearned reader, when placed before him, are overlooked even by the enlightened thinker, when his observation is not guided by the legitimate deduction of causes and effects. And in this historical deduction, if we except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a> and Tacitus, Mueller has no superior. Not that he is equal to these great originals, or even to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> historians, in the detailed development of events, and in the arrangement of circumstances in the order of their absolute and relative importance. For the adequate attainment of this great end Mueller was disqualified by a certain deficiency in the powers of abstraction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, in his representation, display no regular subordination; they are frequently crowded together, transposed, or dragged behind. In this respect he is more peculiarly opposed to Tacitus, although the Germans have fondly styled him the twin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of that great historian, who, in the distinction of what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a>, has no equal, and almost no likeness, among the historians either of ancient or modern times. Thucydides and Tacitus he more nearly resembles in the energy and laconic brevity of his style. Pleased only with a strength and fulness of thought, he abhors all that is empty, trivial, or redundant. Impelled by youthful enthusiasm to write the history of his native Switzerland, and dwelling, as it were, for years among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> documents from which his materials were compiled, his powerful style insensibly contracted a certain antique colouring from the language of the ancient chronicles; and thus it is that his diction more vividly expresses the character of that peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, which, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, was then living in his own imagination. What was tasteless and offensive in the style of the old chronicles was indeed softened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in Mueller's cultivated mind; but while his intellect was engrossed with the connection of events, a laconic brevity had for his individual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> an irresistible charm, even when purchased at the expense of easy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. Mueller's History of the Helvetic Confederacy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on which he laboured longest, and to which he applied the whole force of his industry and talents, is the book in which we may best discover the spirit of his historical composition, in all its qualities both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> and detail. But this work, one of the most singular products of great historical intellect, requires so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to a multitude of small matters of fact, the details of which might easily have been omitted, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> brevity, combined with the antiquated costume of the expression, exacts from the reader, unaccustomed to such a style, so vehement a stretch of thought, that we are ever and anon compelled to lay aside the book and breathe, in order to collect new strength for the perusal. Indeed, no book has, perhaps, been so much praised, and so little read, as the Helvetic History of our author. Mueller, who, from youth till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and amid literary and political occupations of another kind, always considered the history of his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> as the principal object of his life, had so accustomed himself to that character of composition, which he thought accommodated to a history of Switzerland, that in his other writings, he is not wholly able to divest himself of its peculiarities. His Universal History, first drawn up in French, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of young persons who were his pupils at Geneva, afterwards with greater care re-written in the German tongue, and first published after the author's death, though comprising, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a>, all ancient and modern ages, is, however, far inferior in historical value to the history of Switzerland; but the nature of its subject is more agreeable to the majority of readers; and in the condensation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, the style has a certain facility, in which we easily recognise the man to whom French was in his youth a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> mother-tongue.\n\nOf the other writings of Mueller, the most remarkable are the Letters, which were not written\nfor the world, but published after his death in the collection of his works, of which they occupy several volumes. From these letters we learn the character of the man on its fairest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> side; and we likewise see how far his style is removed from the affectation with which he has so often been reproached. For in these letters, written rapidly, without premeditation, and to confidential friends, the historian of the Helvetian Confederacy is recognized in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>; and the absence of a smooth and polished diction is in itself an excellence, when contrasted with the paint of letters written for admiration and display.","sp":869,"ep":871},{"h":"THIS TERM","t":"s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> expresses the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> possessed by some minerals, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> without breaking. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">Flexible</a> minerals are either elasical flexible, that is, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> when bent they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> back again into their former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICA\">mica</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> flexible, when they can be bent in different directions without breaking, and remain in the direction in which they have been bent, as molybdena, gypsum, talc, asbestos, and all malleable minerals.\n\nXV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">Adhesion</a> to the Tongue.\n\nThis character occurs only in such minerals as possess the property of absorbing moisture, which causes them to adhere to the tongue.

But, in the midst of all those pecuniary embarrassments, the most flattering accounts of the Company's affairs were circulated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> opulence there was a general disposition to credulity. The splendid acquisition which the Company had made of the territorial revenues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> events in which they had been involved, and the immense fortunes with which a few individuals had returned to Europe, confirmed the general delusion, and inflamed the impatience of the proprietors of East India stock to participate in the inexhaustible treasures of their new dominions. In pursuance of these views, the dividend on their stock was raised from 6 to 10 per cent.; India stock rose to 263 per cent. A higher dividend was called for, and it was in vain that the Directors represented the heavy debts of the Company, and the general embarrassment of their affairs. The Proprietors refused to listen to such disagreeable representations, and at a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> they voted a dividend of 12\u00bd per cent. for the year 1767. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> being now directed to the Company's affairs, this vote was rescinded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and the dividend limited to 10 per cent.\n\nIn the meantime, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> was refuting the fallacious expectations of annual treasures from India. It was represented, that the territorial revenue of the Company would prove an inexhaustible source of wealth; and the Directors and Proprietors, in giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> promises, of which their servants had been very liberal, were the dupes of their own credulous avarice. Hitherto, however, promises were all that had ever been received from India. So far from possessing any surplus revenue, the servants were involved in debt for the current expenses of their government; they drew largely on the directors, but they remitted little; and the whole of this complicated scheme of trade and sovereignty laboured in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> under such pecuniary difficulties, that the directors, to avert a public bankruptcy, were compelled to apply to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> for a loan of L400,000, and afterwards of L300,000. In consequence of this state of things, so different from the pleasing fancies of unbounded wealth, with which the proprietors of the Company, and the coun-\ntry at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, had been amused, great discontent, and a violent clamour, was raised against the Company's servants in India, who, by their profusion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> corruption, had failed to realize those golden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>. The affairs of the Company were at length brought under the consideration of Parliament by the minister, who introduced two acts for the regulation of their affairs, a full account of which, and of the discussions which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in consequence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found in the Encyclopaedia, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">BRITAIN</a> and COMPANIES.\n\nIt may suffice to observe here, that these acts vested the administration of the affairs abroad in a Governor-General, with four councillors, rendering the other presidencies subject to that of Bengal, and establishing a supreme court of judicature at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and three other judges.\n\nAlthough the ascendancy of the English had for some years been thoroughly established in Bengal; and although they were formally invested in 1765 with the sovereignty of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, its affairs were still administered in the name of the native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and according to the forms and policy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. Justice was still dispensed by the native courts, and by the Nabob's officers; the revenues still flowed through the same channels into the public exchequer; and all transactions with foreign powers were carried on under the same authority as formerly. But such was the increasing power of the English, that the government, so far as regarded the protection of the people, was dissolved. Neither the Nabob nor his officers dared to offer any opposition to their sovereign will; and the tribunals of justice, far from being a refuge to the oppressed, became subservient to the rapacity of the Gomastahs, or Indian agents, employed by the Company's servants, and were converted by them into most efficacious instruments for oppressing and plundering the people.\n\nThe Directors had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> dissatisfied with the proceedings of their servants, and with the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> revenues, which had fallen far short of their expectations, and they now resolved to put an end to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> administration of the Nabob and the Company; and dispensing with the empty name of the former, to take upon themselves, ostensibly as well as really, the entire care and management of the land revenues. But they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the important consequences which were involved in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>; they were not aware, that it was an innovation on long established habits and prejudices, and on the settled policy of the country; that it unsettled the basis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> as well as the administration of civil and criminal justice; and that it was calculated to produce a greater revolution in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> manners, than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the country had been transferred by conquest from one sovereign to another. In order to explain this point, it will be necessary briefly to describe the state of property and manners which prevailed in India under its native rulers.\n\nUnder the Mogul government the public revenue was derived from a general land-tax, and the regular payment of this tribute was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> by which property was generally held throughout the empire. The lands were possessed by different descriptions of owners or occupiers, under the titles chiefly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-ZEMINDARS\">Zemindars</a>, Talookdars, and Ryots. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the Zemindary tenure has been a standing subject of controversy among the Company's servants; some insisting, that under the Mogul despotism, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> was the sole proprietor of the lands, and the Zemindar, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a>, appointed by the Government to collect and superintend the land revenues; and, after reserving a suitable portion for his own maintenance, to remit the surplus to the imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>; while others maintain that he was proprietor of the lands, and that he was only bound to the state for a stipulated tax or quit rent. Without entering into this controversy, which is rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> than of any practical consequence, it may be observed, that the Zemindars had lived for centuries in great splendour on the produce of their lands, which had quietly descended under the existing tenure through successive generations; that they had the power to sell, to alienate, or to mortgage; and that so long as they paid the annual tribute to government, they enjoyed secure possession of their estates. Under a despotic government arbitrary ejectments might no doubt occur; but these were rare, and they were universally regarded, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and usage, as the illegal outrages of abused power. It is admitted, on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, that these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> belonged to the Zemindars, and the only point that still remains in dispute (and it does not appear very material) seems to be, whether, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the Mogul constitution, the receipt of the land-tax by the sovereign, or of his allotted share of the produce by the Zemindar, entitled the one or the other to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of proprietor of the land.\n\nThe Zemindars, being bound to the state for the revenue, were necessarily invested with the power of collecting the land-tax from the subordinate landholders and tenants. They united, in this manner, legal authority with the possession of property, while, as judges and magistrates, they administered both civil and criminal justice, and were held responsible for all crimes committed within their respective boundaries. In the criminal court held by the Zemindar, he had the power of inflicting all sorts of penalties, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> punishments, on reporting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, before execution, at Moorschedabad. There were various other descriptions of occupiers or tenants, such as the Talookdars, &c. who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> claims on the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; and, while the government looked to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> landholders for the discharge of its demands, the inferior occupants and tenants were bound, each to his immediate superior, for their several proportions of the stipulated tax. The Ryots were the cultivators of the soil, who claimed the hereditary right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPANCY\">occupancy</a>, which they transmitted to their children, and from which, so long as they paid their demands to the state, they could not be lawfully ejected.\n\nThe country was divided into villages or districts, comprising some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> or thousands of acres of arable and waste land. The district was divided into a greater or smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of shares, according to circumstances, and was either cultivated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> labour of the whole inhabitants, or each individual was allotted a separate share for his own maintenance. In the one case, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> were bound, jointly and severally, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rent, while, in the other, each individual paid his separate\nshare. There were various distinctions of rights among the inhabitants, some of occupancy, some of ownership, of which exact accounts were kept in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the village, as well as by the parties interested.* Every village had also its establishment of public officers and tradesmen. These consisted of the Pota\u00efl, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> inhabitant, whose business it was to superintend the affairs of the village, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> disputes among the inhabitants, to attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, and to the collection of the public tax; the Carnum, to whom it belonged to keep an account of the cultivation and produce of the land\u2014to register the proprietors of the village, and to attest all deeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, transfer, or assignment; the Boundaryman, who preserves the limits of the village, or gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of them, in case of dispute; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">Priest</a>, the Schoolmaster, the Astrologer; the Smith, the Carpenter, the Potter, the Washerwoman, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARBER\">Barber</a>, the Cowkeeper, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">Dancing</a>-Girl, the Musician, the Poet, who were each rewarded for their labours out of the produce of the village lands. The amount of their shares on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> produce is estimated at 5\u00bd per cent. The collectors were allowed 10 per cent., and the remaining proportion of the crop was divided between the sovereign and the cultivator.\n\nIt was not the policy of the Mahometan conquerors, when they invaded India, to innovate materially on the management of the land-revenues, or even to oppress the cultivators by heavy impositions. It was in 1573, during the reign of the Emperor Akbar, that they completed the conquest of the country; and a general rent-roll was at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> formed for all Hindostan, by Rajah Torrel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>, minister of finance to the emperor, as well as a scheme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> fixing the separate proportions of districts and villages. According to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, a settlement was concluded by which the amount of the tax was fixed at 1 crore, 49 lacks, 61,482 rupees, or nearly L1,683,166.\u2020 This assessment does not appear to have been increased by subsequent monarchs, since its amount, according to the authenticated rent-roll of the Mogul treasury, was, in 1728, L1,425,000; which is only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of L75,000 from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> standard, in the course of two centuries. Under the Mogul government, however, the inferior occupants and cultivators of the land possessed no adequate security for the possession of their rights; and though, during the vigour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, the zemindars might be restrained by the dread of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, or by their regard to laws and immemorial usages, from gross oppression, yet many abuses afterwards took place, under which the share of the crop left to the Ryots was reduced to a bare subsistence.\n\nIn the reign of Aliverdi Cawn, who succeeded to the throne in 1741, the land-tax imposed by Akbar was augmented by various arbitrary assessments. To the original ground rent other taxes were added, some permanent, and others occasional. These consisted of duties on the transit of goods through the country, of taxes on shops and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and of fines and exactions of various sorts; and the Zemindar, who was bound to the state for the revenue, was empowered in proportion to those augmented demands to increase the contribution of his tenants. In the reign of Meer Cossim, who was set up by the Company's servants in 1761, these oppressions were carried to a still greater height. He was raised to the sovereignty on the well understood condition of subservience to the rapacity of the English; he had engaged to pay them large sums on his elevation to the throne, and it was essential to the fulfilment of his iniquitous bargain that he should plunder his subjects. His government is accordingly described as being in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> illegal and oppressive. In place of adhering to the assessment fixed by the ancient policy of the empire, he instructed his agents to ascertain, by exact survey, the produce of the land, and he claimed for the treasury the whole surplus which remained, after allowing a bare maintenance to the cultivators.\n\nAfter the dethronement of this prince, the country was by no means improved under the growing ascendancy of the English. The state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> which prevailed in Hindostan arose from the mixed operation of a peculiar system of laws, customs, manners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and policy; such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> structure required to be nicely and skilfully handled; in place of which it was lacerated in all its delicate parts by the rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of foreign interference. The English were ignorant even of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the people whom they had brought under their sway, and whom they now attempted to govern; and though they might know generally, that the public revenues were derived from an impost on land, they were entirely inexperienced in the usages of the country, and in the financial details of the Mogul government. They knew not through what an infinite variety of petty channels the land revenue was brought together, and at last poured into the imperial treasury. With what effect, therefore, could they interfere in such complicated details; how could they decide between the claims of justice and of fraud; how could they judge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> connected with the peculiar usages of the country, and with all those minutiae of local manners with which no foreigners can ever become thoroughly acquainted? The Company's servants, involved in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABYRINTH\">labyrinth</a> of complex concerns, possessed no clue to guide them to any equitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. Supposing their views to have been honest, they wanted intelligence to give them effect, and although they could enforce submission to their decrees, the country, under their usurped and ill-directed authority, presented one vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> and oppression. Nor was there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> to which the oppressed could fly for relief; the Nabob, the nominal ruler of the country, being totally without power, and consequently unable to maintain\n\n* See Appendix to the Fifth Report (printed, by order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, 1812), from the Select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> on the Affairs of the East India Company, p. 714, where, in the extracts from the Report of Mr Place, the reader will find a detailed view of the different rights and privileges, some of ownership, some of property, claimed by the inhabitants of the village.\n\n\u2020 A lack of rupees is 100,000, a crore is 100 lacks, or ten millions. The rupee is worth about 2s. 3d.\nthe authority of his tribunals against the masters of the country. (Mill, Vol. II. p. 309.)\n\nAll those evils were readily ascribed by the Directors to the misconduct and incapacity of their servants, who, in their eagerness to make fortunes for themselves, totally neglected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of their masters; and this was no doubt true. But the objection of the Directors was, that they plundered the country for their own benefit, and not for that of the Company. Had the wealth acquired found its way into the public treasury, and been remitted to Europe in the form of a large investment, no such heavy complaints would have been made. The hope of receiving a surplus from their territorial revenues was, indeed, a delusion long and fondly cherished by the proprietors in this country. They expected to share among them the wealth of India. The land and labour of the country was to be laid under contribution for the benefit of its mercantile proprietors in Europe. The new sovereigns of India could never relinquish the notion of profit, the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>. Their conceptions were never elevated to the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of their situation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of a sovereign consists in the felicity of grateful millions, and this is the only true and legitimate end of all government. But the East India Company were intent on profit,\u2014on enriching themselves at the expense of their subjects; and the duty of the servants to their masters consisted in sending home a large investment. They were to possess themselves of as large a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> as possible of the produce of the country, giving nothing in return, and to send it to Europe to be shared among the proprietors; and it was, accordingly, the boast of successive administrations how well they had succeeded in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>,\u2014not how happy they had made their subjects,\u2014but how much of their property they had taken from them and sent to Europe.\n\nTo realize the hopes of a large surplus revenue from India, the territorial revenues were racked to the utmost. The revenue contracted for in 1765 amounted to L. 1,607,826; in 1766 and 1767, it amounted to L. 1,719,677, from which deductions were afterwards made, as it was found impossible to collect it. The revenue, however, actually realized, exceeded the surplus formerly paid into the Mogul treasury when the country was in a flourishing condition. But the methods by which it was collected were ruinous to the country. The landholders, failing almost universally in their engagements, were left to the mercy of the revenue-officers, by whom they were grievously oppressed. In many parts the villages were deserted by the cultivators, and the land was left desolate. All those evils were still further aggravated by a grievous famine which prevailed in Bengal, in the year 1770, by which it is computed that about one-third of the inhabitants perished. But, in the midst of all this misery, the revenue was still violently kept up to its former standard. The deficiencies occasioned by the famine were re-assessed on those who survived this calamity, and so strictly were they levied, that the land revenue for that year exhibited an increase above that of the year preceding. The ruinous effects of this heavy exaction are stated at length in the different letters from the Governor-General to the Directors. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, dated 3d November 1772, he observes, \"It was naturally to be expected that the diminution of the revenue should have kept an equal pace with the other consequences of so great a calamity; that it did not, was owing to its being violently kept up to its former standard.\" He then describes the method by which this was accomplished, which was by \"an assessment upon the actual inhabitants of every inferior division of the lands, to make up for the loss sustained in the rents of their neighbours, who are either dead or have fled the country.\" \"The tax (he continues) not being levied by any fixed rate or standard, fell heaviest on the wretched survivors of those villages which had suffered the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a>, and were of course the most entitled to the lenity of government. It had also this additional evil attending it, in common with every other variation from the regular practice, that it afforded an opportunity to the farmers, or sheidars, to levy other contributions off the people under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of it, and even to increase this to whatever magnitude they pleased, since they were in course the judges of the loss sustained, and of the proportion which the inhabitants were to pay to replace it.\" To the same effect, Mr Middleton, one of the superintendents of the public revenue, observes, \"When a very considerable portion, supposed even a third of the whole inhabitants, had perished, the remaining two-thirds were obliged to pay for the lands now left without cultivators. The country has languished ever since, and the evil continues enhancing every day. The first remedy, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of which all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> will be fruitless, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of some considerable portion of the revenue throughout the provinces. Such remission should have been made immediately on the famine. Its not taking place, then, has made it more and more necessary every day; and the longer it is delayed the more ruinous the consequences must be to this country and its revenue.\"\n\nTo correct these evils, numerous feeble remedies were devised. For the purpose of superintending the native officers, both in the collection of the revenue and in the administration of justice, which were intimately connected with each other in the Mogul Empire, the Company's servants were stationed in different parts of the country with the title of supervisors, and, to add to their security, two councils with authority over the supervisors were established, one at Moorshedabad, and another at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATNA\">Patna</a>. One of the most important duties of these supervisors was to procure information respecting the amount of the land revenues; the manner of collecting them; the amount of the cesses, or arbitrary taxes; the origin and progress of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> exactions; and also to inquire concerning the regulations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and the administration of justice. The reports made by these supervisors concurred with all the other evidence received as to the wretched and oppressed state of the natives. \"The Nazims (they observed) exacted what they could from the Zemindars and great farmers of the revenue, whom they left at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to plunder all below; re-\nserving to themselves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of plundering them in their turn, when they were supposed to have enriched themselves with the spoils of the country.\"\n\nSuch was the condition of the country when the Directors resolved to supersede the native government in the management of the land revenues. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> was adopted without any consideration, how far their servants were qualified for the task of legislators among a people with whose manners, habits, and laws, they were totally unacquainted; and the latter, on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, seem as little to have distrusted their qualifications for the duties assigned them. They resolved to make a settlement of the land revenues for five years, commencing from the year 1772. For this purpose, a committee of the board, consisting of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> and five members, named the \"Committee of Circuit,\" was appointed, who were to make a journey through the country, and were empowered to receive proposals for a new lease of the lands, first from their ancient possessors, and, if their offers were deemed unsatisfactory, they were to be let by public auction to the highest bidder. These persons proceeded in their circuit through the country, publicly advertising and letting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>, for the highest rent that could be obtained, the estates of such as hesitated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> for the assessment proposed. A great proportion of the landed property throughout Bengal was thus exposed to auction; and, in the general sale, the former owners and the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of the country were outbidden by adventurers, to whom property was acceptable on any terms, and were generally dispossessed of their lands, from the surplus produce of which a provision was assigned them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of the revenue committee.\n\nThe supervisors who had been stationed in the different districts were invested with the necessary powers for the collection of the revenue, and were henceforth denominated collectors. A native officer was to be joined with them under the title of duan, to confirm and to check accounts, and to assist in all those multifarious details which were intelligible only to a native. Various regulations were adopted to check the exertions of the collectors; but the governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> express their regret that it was not in their power wholly to remedy this evil. (Mill's British India, Vol. II. p. 312.) Under the Mogul government, the duty of collecting the revenues and of administering justice was united, as formerly mentioned, in the person of the zemindars. The new scheme for the management of the revenues subverted this ancient order of things. The zemindar was superseded both as collector and as judge, and his place was supplied by two courts, the one for civil, the other for criminal proceedings, established in each district. In the criminal court the new collector of taxes was to act as president, to be assisted by two Mahometan officers, the cauzee and the muftee, and by two Mohlavies, as interpreters of the law. The civil court consisted, in like manner, of the collector as president, assisted by the duan and other officers of the native court. Two supreme courts were, at the same time, established at Calcutta, for the review of the inferior courts both civil and criminal. To one of these all capital cases were reported, and were ultimately referred to the governor and council; who, finding the labour too great, restored, in 1774, this branch of administration to the nominal Nabob, and carried back the court to Moorshedabad. It appeared that, for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> before this, the administration of criminal justice was wholly at a stand. In the new arrangements all disputes about property, not exceeding ten rupees in value, were referred to the head <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of the district to which the parties belonged.\n\nIn considering those regulations, the question naturally occurs, how these supervisors, who were now to act in the double capacity of collector and judge, became qualified for the discharge of such important functions? In all other countries, it is only by a previous course of laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, that any one is qualified for the office of a judge, and to appoint an unqualified person would be reckoned both dangerous and absurd. But how much more dangerous and absurd was it to appoint uninstructed persons to act as judges in a foreign land, with whose language they are but imperfectly acquainted, and of whose laws, manners, and customs, they are thoroughly ignorant? If, among a comparatively rude people, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of proceeding be loose and arbitrary,\u2014if there be no books of written law, or of precedents to govern judicial decisions, which must consequently depend on the imperfect lights and analogies afforded by manners, religion, or customs, the incapacity of a foreigner for the discharge of such nice duties becomes even more glaring. By disposing of the administration of justice in this manner, it was clear, that the judicial duties would either be neglected, or that they would still be performed as before, and with no increased chance of amendment by native officers. This new arrangement was, therefore, like many others, a useless innovation on the established practice of the country. There is another weighty objection to the union in one person of the duties of collector and judge, namely, that it was in the collection of the duties that the grossest oppression had been committed; the powers of the collectors being frequently perverted to the most iniquitous ends. Under this new project those who sought redress from the courts of justice, met with their oppressor in the capacity of judge. He judged in his own case and of complaints brought against his own conduct. Justice was in this manner an empty name, unless it was supposed that the judge would pronounce himself an oppressor.\n\nUnder the five years' lease on which the land revenues had been farmed in 1772, the country was grievously overtaxed. The revenues fell into a heavy arrear the very first year, and the lands were let on a progressive rent. To collect the outstanding balances; and to force up the revenue to its standard, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOST\">host</a> of extortioners was, under the name of Aumils, or collectors, let loose upon the afflicted country. But the rents contracted for by the farmers of the revenue were greater than they could pay, and, notwithstanding all their efforts, the arrears <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to increase. On the five years' lease, they amounted to a sum equal in value to L.1,54,277, which was judged to be wholly irrecoverable; while, during the same period, the sums remitted, even under the rigorous management of public farmers, amounted to L.1,336,451. Nor was this the only\nevil arising from the mal-administration of the Company's servants. The zemindars, who are admitted on all hands, even by those who advocate the sovereign's right to the possession of the soil, to have lived in splendour on their hereditary possessions,\u2014in all cases to have possessed the powers of magistracy within their district, and where the territory was large, to have exercised a species of sovereignty,\u2014were either despoiled of their estates, or, where they were induced, by a hereditary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their possessions, to engage for the rent proposed, they were overwhelmed with taxes which they could not pay, and were thus involved in poverty and ruin. Where the zemindar was himself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> of the revenue, he exercised the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a> on his inferiors which was applied to himself; where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> jobber, who had no interest whatever in the property of the tenants, was the farmer, there was no limit to his extortion and cruelty.\n\nThe defects in this system for the administration of the land revenues soon began to disclose themselves; and the rulers of India, whose government was one continued innovation, immediately resolved to make another considerable change in the state machinery, which they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> set in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. They abolished the superintendence of the collectors, and the country, with the exception of Chittagong and Tipperah, being formed into six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> divisions, viz. Calcutta, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURDWAN\">Burdwan</a>, Moorshedabad, Dinazepore, Dacca, and Patna, a council was appointed for each of the last five, consisting of a chief and four senior servants, to whom were transferred the powers and duties of the collectors. They were to preside in the courts of justice, and to superintend the collections; and, in subordinate districts, they delegated their powers to naibs or amuls, who were natives, and who were appointed, like their superiors, to collect and to judge in all cases under the value of 1000 rupees. The empty privilege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> was, as formerly, reserved to the unsuccessful suitor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> courts, and to superintend the whole collections of the country, a grand revenue-office was established at the presidency. The district of Calcutta was placed under the peculiar superintendence of a committee of revenue, consisting of two members of the Council and three inferior servants. These regulations, which were declared to be temporary, and only preparatory to something more permanent, failed as usual in all their important objects. The defective administration of justice among the natives was admitted and complained of by all parties, and the peace of the country was in consequence disturbed by the general prevalence of robbery and other enormous crimes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, that the new arrangements had subverted the ancient institutions and local manners of the country, and had thus left a void in its internal economy which the Government was in vain endeavouring to fill up.\n\nThe lease of the lands expired in 1777; and, after various suggestions and consultations, it was resolved that the rent should be regulated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> collections of the three preceding years, and that the lands should be let, not by auction, but by an agreement with their ancient possessors in preference to other competitors. The liberal views of Mr Francis, who proposed that, in lieu of the monopoly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and opium, a moderate duty should be imposed on those articles, and that a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of oppression should thus be terminated, by giving freedom to trade, were rejected by the Governor-General. In pursuance of the plan proposed, the lands were let from year to year until the necessary arrangements could be completed for the system which was now to be adopted of a permanent land-tax.\n\nThe attention of the British Parliament had frequently been directed to the state of our Indian possessions, and to the transactions of the resident government; and, in 1784, a new system was established in Britain for the control of the local administration, under which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Cornwallis, who was chosen Governor-General, was specially directed by the act of Parliament, as well as by instructions from the Directors and the Board of Control, \"to inquire into the alleged grievances of the landholders, and, if founded in truth, to afford them redress; and to establish permanent rules for the settlement and collection of the land revenue, and for the administration of justice, founded on the ancient laws and local usages of the country.\"\n\nLord Cornwallis, on his arrival in India, did not deem matters fully ripe for the execution of the proposed plan, namely, the permanent settlement of the land revenue. On this important subject he found a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> among the most intelligent of the Company's servants. Neither the nature of the land tenure, nor the rights of the different orders of people, who shared among them the produce of the soil, were sufficiently understood. All that was distinctly known was the amount of the revenue; but whether it was too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> or too low was still a point in dispute among the English in India. In such wide diversity of opinion, the Governor-General was naturally anxious to proceed with caution, and to delay for some time the plan of a permanent settlement. The lands were, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, let from year to year through the agency of the district collectors, and information on which to found a more durable arrangement was diligently sought from every source.\n\nIn 1789, Lord Cornwallis had matured his plans for the permanent settlement of the land revenues. This he now conceived to be the only measure that could retrieve the country from its present condition, which he described to be wretched in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>. \"I am sorry (he observes) to be obliged to say, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> and internal commerce have for many years been gradually declining; and that at present, excepting the class of Shroffs and Banjans (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKERS\">bankers</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>), who reside almost entirely in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, the inhabitants of these provinces are advancing hastily to a general state of poverty and wretchedness. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> I must even include every zemindar in the Company's territories; which, though it may have been partly occasioned by their own indolence and extravagance, I am afraid must also be in a great measure attributed to the effects of our former system of management.\"\u2014\"I may safely (says he) assert, that one-third of the Company's territory in Hindostan is now a jungle, inhabited only by wild beasts.\" So thoroughly persuaded was Lord Cornwallis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a permanent settlement of the land re-\nvenues, with a view to the improvement of the country, that the agreement with the landholders, at first made for ten years, was afterwards declared unalterable; and the zemindars of Bengal, Bihar, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORISSA\">Orissa</a>, were formally constituted legal and perpetual proprietors of their respective estates on the payment of a fixed rent to the state. The ten years, or, as it is called, the Decennial settlement, was completed in every district in 1793, and was afterwards extended to the conquered countries.\n\nAlong with the decennial settlement Lord Cornwallis also introduced other important reforms in the administration of civil and criminal justice. The union of the duties of tax-gatherer and judge had produced, as might have been expected, the most glaring abuses. The tax-gatherer not only officiated in many cases as his own judge, but where the duties of the two offices happened to interfere, which was often the case, it invariably happened that the one was discharged by the neglect of the other. It was now proposed to separate those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> functions, and to establish in each district of the country, and in all the considerable towns, a civil court, in which one of the Company's servants, higher in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> than the collector, should act as judge, to be assisted by a register, and one or more of the junior servants of the Company, and also by a native expounder of Hindu or Mahomedan law. The judge was authorized to refer all cases of inconsiderable importance to his register, from whom there lay an appeal to himself; and for determining suits regarding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> property, not above the value of 50 rupees, courts of native commissioners were established in every district, to decide in a summary manner. From this inferior court of law there lay an appeal to the court of the district, whose decision was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a>, except in cases of real property, or in the event of the decision of the inferior court being reversed. A new scheme of appellate jurisdiction was also introduced. All causes involving property above the value of 1000 rupees might formerly be appealed to the Governor-General in council. This court, however, was found to be useless to the natives, whose disputes never involved property to such an amount, and who, as the court was established in Calcutta, could not afford the expense of such distant litigation. To remedy this grievance, Lord Cornwallis established four tribunals of appeal; one in the vicinity of Calcutta, and one at Patna, Dacca, and Moorshedabad. In these three the Company's servants were to sit as judges, to be assisted by a register, and one or more of the junior servants of the Company, and by three expounders of native law. To these, which were styled provincial courts, the privilege of appeal was eventually given from all the decisions of the inferior tribunals. To complete these arrangements, a court of supreme jurisdiction was established at Calcutta, composed of the Governor-General, and the members of the superior council, with suitable assistants both English and natives. The former exaction of 25 per cent. by the judge on all litigated property was abolished, as well as the impost on the commencement of the writ, and all fees of court.\n\nSuch were the arrangements adopted by Lord Cornwallis for the reformation of the civil judicature in India. The criminal department he describes as being replete with still more disgraceful corruption. In a letter to the Directors, dated 17th November 1790, he observes, \"Your possessions in this country cannot be said to be well governed, nor the lives and property of your subjects to be secure, until the shocking abuses, and the wretched administration, in the criminal department, can be corrected. Anxious as I have been to apply a speedy remedy to evils so disgraceful to government, so ruinous to commerce, and, indeed, destructive to all civil society, it has still appeared to me to be so important as to make it necessary for me to act with great circumspection.\" For the purposes of criminal judicature, four tribunals were established, in which the judges of appeal in the provincial courts were appointed to act, and were provided with the same assistants, as in the civil courts. They were to make regular circuits through the country, holding a session for jail delivery at the four principal cities of Calcutta, Patna, Dacca, and Moorshedabad, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; in the district of Calcutta four times; and in the remaining districts of the country twice in the year. The judges in the four courts of appeal were to form two courts of circuit. The inconvenience of devolving both the civil and criminal business on the same judges was soon heavily felt; and, in 1797, after some previous arrangements, which had been found inadequate, two of the judges were specially appointed to the business of the civil appeal court, while only one was left for the business of the circuit. In addition to these arrangements, a criminal tribunal, of supreme jurisdiction, was established at the seat of government, composed in the same manner as the supreme civil court of the Governor-General and members of the Supreme Council.\n\nIn regard to the plan for the permanent settlement of the land revenues, which demands our first consideration, it may be remarked, that, in the imposition of a land-tax, the great danger is, not that Plans; and it be too small, but that it be too large; and this generally of evil ought more especially to have been guarded against in framing an assessment that was to be fixed and invariable. Lord Cornwallis, in calculating that permanent possession, on payment of an invariable tax, would afford a sure encouragement to cultivation, did not sufficiently consider that this altogether depended on the amount of the tax. The invariable rate of a tax is a benefit to a country exactly as it is moderate or otherwise. In the one case, it is satisfactory to know that it cannot be increased; while, on the other hand, the invariable rate of an oppressive tax is a great additional calamity, as it shuts out from the country all hope of relief. Here, then, was one obvious and capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the scheme, namely, that a permanent land-tax was imposed without any equitable standard to fix its amount. The legislators of India had not yet acquired the necessary knowledge of the country for such a measure. They had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> on which they could, with any certainty, adjust the tax to the capacity of the soil; and, after long discussions, it was at length fixed at the average amount of the collections for the last three years. But it had been a general complaint, that the country was overtaxed; and to this cause was ascribed its misery and decline.\nFrom this high standard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>, no systematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> had ever been made. Arrears, which had been long accumulating, and which could not be recovered, had, indeed, been remitted; but every method of extortion had been practised in order to realize as large a revenue as possible; and the country was now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with a permanent assessment, founded on the actual revenue of those years. The invariable rate of the tax was, in this case, no benefit to the country; and, in order to receive the advantages supposed by Lord Cornwallis to arise from permanent possession, he should have assured himself of the moderation of the tax imposed. In place of this, it was exorbitant, and greater than the land could bear; and this radical defect, even if there had been no other, would have ensured the failure of the plan.\n\nThe zemindar, who was bound, in the first instance, for the public tax, depended, for the means of discharging it, on the produce of his rents; and the estate, by imposing an immoderate tax on him, laid him under the necessity of practising similar extortion on all below him. The example of the government was a general warrant for extortion, which, once begun, would necessarily descend from the proprietor to the lowest tenant.\n\nThere was another important defect in the plan of the decennial settlement, namely, that it seemed to rely entirely on the exertions of the zemindars for the improvement of the country. No attention was given to secure the under-tenants and ryots in the hereditary privileges which they claimed in the soil. As they varied in different places, and depended on different rules, the subject appeared to involve details too troublesome and intricate for European management; and the important task of settling with the ryots was, therefore, devolved on the zemindars, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> general recommendation to be guided by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the place, and to give the ryot a written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of his lease. According to this plan, it was the great proprietors only who had any permanent interest in the lands, while the inferior proprietors and tenantry were at the mercy of the principal landholders, who might exact from them whatever they pleased. The under-tenants and cultivators, in this ill-defined state of their rights, had no interest whatever in the improvement of the soil; being well assured that, however abundant the produce of the soil might prove, they would be left nothing more than a bare maintenance. But it is not agreeable to experience, that the cultivation of any country was ever materially forwarded by the exertions of its great lords. On the contrary, it is their character generally to be inactive, wasteful, and improvident, while the improvement of the land is invariably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the cultivators and tenantry, to whom, however, the plan held out no sort of encouragement. Though humanely intended, therefore, it was calculated to entail ruin upon the higher classes of landholders by the tax which it imposed on them; while by necessitating them, and, at the same time, giving them the power, to oppress all below them, in order to satisfy the exorbitant demands of the state, it necessarily had the effect of extending this ruin downwards to the lowest tenant. Its effects have entirely corresponded to this view of its principle.\n\nIt soon appeared that, in order to realize the revenue, it would be necessary to sell the lands; and this evil once begun continued to increase. The revenue was not punctually paid, and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of outstanding balances lands to a great amount were at stated times exposed to auction. In the year 1796-7, the lands advertised for sale bore a rent of 2,870,061 sicca rupees (\u00a3332,927), and those actually sold yielded an annual rent of 1,418,756 rupees (\u00a3164,576). In 1797-8, the quantity of land sold bore a rent of 2,274,076 rupees (\u00a3255,833), and it is observed in the Fifth Report, p. 56, that \"among the defaulters were some of the oldest and most respectable families of the country;\" \"the dismemberment of whose estates,\" the report continues, \"at the end of each succeeding year, threatened them with poverty and ruin, and, in some instances, presented difficulties to the revenue officers in their endeavours to preserve undiminished the amount of the public assessment.\" In order to check these evils, several alterations were made from time to time by Lord Cornwallis. But they appear to have been unavailing, and, in the year 1802, in a report from one of the collectors, we have the following melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the state of the country:\u2014\"All the zemindars,\" it is observed, \"with whom I ever had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, in this and in other districts, have but one sentiment, respecting the rules at present in force for the collection of the public revenue. They all say, that such a harsh and oppressive system was never before resorted to in this country; that the custom of imprisoning landholders for arrears of revenue was, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, mild and indulgent to them; that though it was no doubt the intention of government to confer an important benefit on them, by abolishing this custom, it has been found by melancholy experience, that the system of sales and attachments, which has been substituted for it, has, in the course of a very few years, reduced most of the great zemindars in Bengal to distress and beggary; and produced a greater change in the landed property than has perhaps ever happened, in the same space of time, in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> or country, by the mere effect of internal regulations.\" (Fifth Report, printed in 1812, p. 60.) In another part of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a>, the collector, after commenting on a regulation then recently introduced, observes, \"Before this period (1799), complaints of the inefficacy of the regulations were very general among the zemindars, or the proprietors of large estates; and it required little discernment to see, that they had not the same powers over their tenants which government exercised over them. It was notorious, that many of them had large arrears of rent due to them, which they were utterly unable to recover; while government were selling their lands for arrears of assessment.\" The collector adds, \"Farmers and intermediate tenants were, till lately, able to withhold their rents with impunity, and to set the authority of their landlords at defiance. Landholders had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> control over them; they could not proceed against them, except through the courts of justice; and the ends of substantial justice were defeated, by delays and cost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>.\" To the same purpose, Sir Henry Strachey observes, \"That the men\nof opulence are now all men of yesterday; that the greatest men formerly were the Musselman rulers, whose places we have now taken, and the Hindoo zemindars. These two classes are now ruined and destroyed.\" (See Answers to the Interrogatories of Government, dated 30th Jan. 1802.)\n\nOne cause which undoubtedly contributed to the ruin of the zemindars, was the want of any effectual method of enforcing their claims against the small tenants. For the purpose of duly collecting the revenue, the public officer was empowered to proceed against defaulters by a summary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>,\u2014and to attach and sell, by public auction, the zemindar's land for the discharge of arrears; while against the under-tenants, the zemindar had to seek redress by an ordinary suit at law, which was both tedious and expensive. To heighten this evil, the courts of justice were overloaded with a long arrear of undecided causes, so that no decision could be expected, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of years. In the district of Burdwan, the undecided suits were said to amount to 30,000, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of a decision in any suit was estimated to exceed the ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The zemindar, in this manner, while he was compelled to pay, by the prompt and efficient process of government, was left to seek redress from his tenants through a labyrinth of endless litigation, and the knowledge of this impediment to justice gave great encouragement to the tenants to refuse payment of their rents. The ruin of the zemindar, therefore, was the inevitable consequence of those measures, which levied on him a heavy assessment by the most summary process, while he was restrained from levying on his tenants the means of its discharge. The zemindar was the channel through which the land revenue flowed into the treasury. He paid what he received, reserving a small surplus for himself; but to pay what he did not receive was impossible. The injustice, then, and the folly of the present measures, consisted in the means adopted to make the zemindar pay, while no means were given him of making others pay to him; in establishing a regular drain on the zemindar's treasury, and at the same time in withholding from him the means of insuring an equally constant supply. These regulations were universally complained of, and on the justest grounds. In an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> from one of the collectors to the board of revenue, in behalf of the Zemindar of Burdwan, who had in vain applied for redress to the civil courts, it is observed, that he (the zemindar) begs leave to \"submit to your consideration, whether or not it can be possible for him to discharge his engagements to government with that punctuality which the regulations require, unless he be armed with powers as prompt to enforce payment from his renters, as government had been pleased to authorize the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, in regard to its claims, on him; and he seems to think it must have proceeded from an oversight, rather than from any just and avowed principle, that there should have been established two modes of judicial process, under the same government; the one summary, and efficient for the satisfaction of its own claims; the other tardy and uncertain in regard to the satisfaction of claims due to its subjects; more especially in a case like the present, where ability to discharge the one demand necessarily depends on the other demand being previously realized.\"\n\nThe system which impoverished the zemindars was equally ruinous to the ryots. It was the practice of the zemindar to contract for a certain rent with a land farmer, who subdivided the land into smaller portions, and let it to a variety of inferior tenants. To this head farmer, it appears that a written agreement was given, according to the regulations; but the under-tenants were left, without any security, to the mercy of their superiors. It is well known, and admitted by the servants of the Company, that the ryot, even when he receives written agreements from the zemindar, is liable to indirect oppressions which no law can remedy; and though, owing to the expense and delay in the administration of justice, he could retaliate on the zemindar, by refusing payment of his rents, this privilege could be of little advantage to him, while it tended still farther to widen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> between the landlord and the tenant, and to add to the hatred, strife, and violent distraction of interests by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> was now, as it were, torn in pieces. To remedy the grievances which the zemindars suffered from the evasion of payment by their tenants, it was enacted, in 1799, that they might have recourse to the same summary process against defaulters, as was tried by the government against themselves. They were empowered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the property of their tenants for arrears, previous to any legal judgment, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the justice of their claim. This regulation gave to the zemindars the power of unbounded oppression, against which the ryot had no redress, as he was effectually shut out of the courts of justice, by the enormous expenses of law proceedings. It was undoubtedly just that the zemindar should have the same efficient process for enforcing payment as was used against himself; but such was the unhappy condition of India, under the unskilful management of strangers, that every plan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> seemed only to increase the general disorder. Her rulers wanted intelligence for the delicate task of domestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>; their schemes were crude and inapplicable, nor could they ever mould the various and jarring interests of the Indian community into any consistent scheme of civil order; so that, though they were continually patching their imperfect work, it still bore the same incongruous character, and the cure of one evil was constantly followed by an irruption of other and worse evils from some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>.\n\nThe institutions of Lord Cornwallis, for the administration of civil and criminal justice, appear to have been equally unsuccessful with his finance measures; and it soon appeared, as has been already stated, that the new courts of judicature had more business than they could manage, and such an arrear of undecided cases accumulated, that the course of\n\n* All the collectors invariably bear testimony to the oppressions of the zemindars, after the passing of the regulation of 1799.\njustice was nearly stopt. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>, the costs of suit were raised for the purpose of discouraging litigation; and this expedient being found ineffectual, they were raised a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time. To place justice out of the reach of the poorer and more numerous class, by laying a heavy tax on it, was indeed an easy and effectual method of discouraging litigation. It was, in fact, a denial of justice,\u2014a direct refusal to hear the complaints of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, who might, therefore, be harassed for ever after with impunity. Notwithstanding this discouragement, however, the evil went on increasing, and at last amounted to an almost total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of civil order. As no decision was to be procured before the regularly constituted tribunal, every man began to arm himself in his own quarrel, and the country thus became the scene of bloody affrays between armed individuals unhappily left without any other resource for the decision of their differences. In some of those conflicts 4000 or 5000 persons were arrayed on each side, and many lives were lost.\n\nIn a letter of the Court of Directors, dated October 1814, it is observed, \"As to affrays respecting the possession and boundaries of lands and rents, this has been long a serious evil, and must, we conceive, have existed in a greater or less degree in every part of the country.\"\u2014These affrays,\" continue the Directors, \"which often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to homicides and woundings, have been very naturally ascribed by several of the judges to the difficulty of obtaining judicial redress.\"*\n\nIn the district of Tirhoot, where the public peace had been frequently disturbed by those private feuds, the judge, for the division of Patna, observes, that they chiefly \"arose from the accumulated arrears of suits,\" and \"that the parties finding a delay in obtaining redress, had resorted to force.\"\u2020 Mr Melville, also a judge in the division of Dacca, expresses himself to the same purpose. \"With respect to affrays (he observes) attended with homicides and wounding, it is known that those disorders arose from attempts to retain by force possession of lands, or rents of lands, to which the different parties alleged separate claims.\" The same person afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that \"in Chittagong, they (meaning these quarrels) had not only been frequent, but violent; that the police authority had been often resisted, and in one instance overpowered; that it would be wrong to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> the length of time a claimant must wait, with the sacrifices he must make, before the decision of a civil court can be obtained.\"\n\nWe shall now briefly advert to the system of penal judicature and police established by Lord Cornwallis; the object, in this case, being to give security to the people by the suppression of crimes. With reference to this object, however, the scheme has notoriously failed. Since the year 1793, India has become a prey to disorders of every sort, and to the worst of crimes. Violence and depravity seem to have overspread the land, and to have produced an almost universal dissolution of morals among the people. The crime of robbery, accompanied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, had risen to a most alarming height in India, and was prosecuted with a degree of union, perseverance, and cruelty, inconceivable to those who live in the civilized communities of Europe. Robbery is a regular profession, which is handed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from father to son; and the decoits, or gang-robbers, are formed, as the title implies, into powerful confederacies, and make their irruptions on the peaceful country with a force which it is vain to resist. They are described by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HASTINGS\">Hastings</a> as \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of outlaws, who live from father to son in a state of warfare against society, plundering and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> villages, and murdering the inhabitants.\" In the year 1772, the robbers are mentioned by the Committee of Circuit, and stated to be \"not like robbers in England, individuals driven to such courses by sudden want; they are robbers by profession, and even by birth; they are formed into regular communities, and their families subsist by the spoils which they bring home to them.\"\n\nAll the reports of the judges employed in the administration of criminal justice concur in representing the deplorable prevalence of the atrocious crimes of gang-robbery and murder. Sir Henry Strachey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> on this subject in 1802, observes, that the crime of decoity (that is, robbery by gangs) has increased greatly since the British administration of justice. Another judge, writing on the same subject in 1808, observes, \"That decoity (gang-robbery) is very prevalent in Rajeshahye has been often stated. But if its vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> were known: if the scenes of horror, the murders, the burnings, the excessive cruelties, which are continually perpetrated here, were properly represented to government, I am confident that some measures would be adopted to remedy the evil. Certainly, there is not an individual belonging to the government, who does not anxiously wish to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the people from robbery and massacre.\" (Mill, Vol. III. p. 311.) He afterwards adds, that such is the state of things which prevails all over Bengal, and as to his own particular district, he expresses his persuasion that no civilized country ever had so bad a police. To the same purpose, Mr Dowdeswell, the secretary to the government in 1809, observes, in a Report which he drew up on the general state of Bengal, \"Were I to enumerate only a thousandth part of the atrocities of the decoits, and of the consequent sufferings of the people; and were I to soften that recital in every mode which language would permit, I should still despair of obtaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, solely on my own authority, for the accuracy of the narrative.\" \"Robbery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>, and even murder itself (he continues), are not the worst figures, in this horrid and disgusting picture. An expedient of common occurrence with the decoits, merely to induce a confession of property, supposed to be concealed, is, to burn the proprietor with straw or torches, until he discloses the property, or perishes in the flames. And when they are actuated by a spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> against individuals, worse cruelties, if worse can be, are perpetrated by these remorseless criminals. If the informa-\n\n* See Papers relating to the Police and Administration of Justice in Bengal, from 1810 to the present time. Printed, by order of the House of Commons, 1819, p. 21.\n\u2020 Ibid. p. 22.\ntion obtained is not extremely erroneous, the offender, hereafter noticed, himself committed fifteen murders in nineteen days: And volumes might be filled with the atrocities of the decoits, every line of which would make the blood run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> with horror.\" (Fifth Report, p. 603.)\n\nIt would far exceed our limits to trace in detail the cause of these evils, which necessarily arose out of the very nature of the government now established. The truth is, the British were never qualified to act as legislators in India. They were too ignorant of the habits, manners, and character, of the people to meddle with their institutions, on which, however, they were continually innovating. By altering the old mode of settling the land revenues, they compromised the rights of the different classes of landholders and occupiers. Strife and contention immediately ensued,\u2014litigation burst upon society like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>,\u2014the civil courts were overwhelmed with suits which they could not decide; and the people, desperate from a denial of justice, were involved in furious affrays with each other in prosecution of their rights, or, being driven from their lands, they had recourse to robbery for a subsistence. Business was thus, from various sources, accumulated in the criminal courts, which being encumbered with the delay, the expense, and all the tedious formalities of the English practice, proceeded with their decisions at much too slow a pace for the wants of the country; and the evil in this manner daily increased. The mischief of this delay was twofold: 1st, It allowed criminals, during the long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, to prepare the certain means of their escape, by the suborning of false witnesses, who, in the gross dissolution of morals which now prevailed, were always to be readily procured, and in any number; and, 2dly, It entailed a grievous hardship on the innocent, great numbers of whom were crowded into jails with the worst of felons, there to wait until the tardy hand of justice should bring them relief.\n\nThe inefficient state into which the police had fallen was also one cause of the general prevalence of crimes. By the ancient institutions of the Mogul government, ample means were provided for the preservation of the public peace. In every village a permanent body of guards and watchmen was maintained, whose business it was to assist in all the subordinate details both of the revenue and police\u2014to convey the rents of the ryot to the district collector\u2014to watch those ryots who were in arrear\u2014to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> their crops from depredation\u2014to act as guides and protectors to travellers\u2014to collect information of any offences committed\u2014and to report the arrival in the village of suspicious persons. For these various services they had grants of land rent-free, or on very easy terms. Besides this standing force of guards and village watchmen, the zemindar, who was at the head of the police, and was held responsible for all crimes committed within his boundaries, had under his orders a large body of pykes or armed constables, whom he could call out in aid of the police <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, either for the apprehension of offenders, or to prevent breaches of the peace. These establishments, though they had fallen into a state of disrepair at the time of the permanent settlement in 1793, and though they were frequently perverted from their original purposes, yet existed in all parts of the country, and the police force was found to be in great efficiency and strength. The zemindary of Burdwan, a tract of country 73 miles long by 45 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, which was in the highest state of cultivation, and well stocked with inhabitants, maintained a body of 2400 village watchmen, who were distributed under their respective chiefs among the different villages, for the double purpose of protecting the inhabitants, and of procuring information; besides 19,000 pykes or armed constables, who were liable to be called out, under the orders of the zemindar, in aid of the police. In place of improving upon those ancient establishments which had taken root in the country, which were interwoven with the frame and texture of Indian society, and which were, generally speaking, efficient, though frequently perverted from their original purposes, Lord Cornwallis demolished the whole structure. According to his new scheme of police, the zemindary constables were disbanded, and their lands, which were allowed them in lieu of pay, were resumed, i.e., were seized by government. The country was divided into districts of 20 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, over which a native police officer, or darogah, was placed, with 15 or 20 armed men under his orders; he was assisted also by the village watchmen, and such of the zemindary constables as were still retained in the public service. It was soon found, however, that the new police officers could not effectually call out this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> in aid of the civil power. They wanted the personal consideration of the zemindars, who had been long looked up to with respect and reverence as the hereditary aristocracy of the country. The system proved, therefore, eminently inefficient, nor were the officers employed under the new plan found to be less corrupt than the disbanded constables of the zemindars. The merits of the plan appear to be pretty fairly estimated in the Fifth Report, p. 71, in which it is observed, that the head police officers, and \"the inferior officers acting under them, with as much inclination to do evil, have less ability to do good, than the zemindary servants employed before them.\" How vain was it to imagine, that any better materials could be found for the regulation and government of the country than those which the country itself afforded! To complain of them was to complain of the general state of society out of which they were produced; and to throw them away, because they are corrupt or otherwise imperfect, evinces an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">Legislator</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, which is not to create materials, but to make the best use of those which are provided to his hand. Herein, then, consisted the error of the British Legislators. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> from them the only efficient instruments which were to be found for the government of the Indian community, while they had nothing to substitute in their place; and their plans, when tried in practice, were accordingly found to be idle theories, at variance with the whole frame and order of the society for whose use they were intended.\n\nThe pernicious consequences of thus rashly subverting the ancient establishments of the country were soon displayed in the alarming increase of crimes. The disbanded zemindary constables, whose lands were seized, were deprived of the means of\nliving, and they necessarily betook themselves to theft and rapine for a subsistence. The country became infested with gangs of robbers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>, whose horrid cruelties struck terror into the peaceable inhabitants, while lesser crimes also became more frequent. The police was inadequate to the detection of offenders; the courts of justice to their conviction; and, among other evils, a host of false witnesses now arose, amid the general corruption of morals, who swore in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of each other, perplexing all judicial proceedings, and confounding the innocent with the guilty. For remedy of these complicated evils, various expedients were resorted to. Among others, a feeble attempt was made to revive the ancient powers which the zemindars had over the police; but this was attended with so little success that it was abandoned in 1810. In 1808 a superintendent of police was appointed, with a view of concentrating, as was stated, in his office, all the information which might be obtained from different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, and of giving unity and vigour to the measures adopted for the apprehension of offenders; and as a last resource, a regular establishment of police spies, called goyendas, was organized, and placed under a species of superintendents, called girdwars, the office of the first being to point out the robbers, that of the latter to apprehend them. Notwithstanding all these measures, crimes of every description appear to have gone on increasing, and, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> of Lord Minto, dated November 1810, it is observed, \"That a monstrous and disorganized state of society existed under the eye of the supreme British authorities, and almost at the very seat of that government to which the country might justly look for safety and protection; that the mischief could not wait for a slow remedy; that the people were perishing almost in our sight; that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>'s delay was a doom of slaughter and torture against the defenceless inhabitants of very populous countries.\" The Directors, in whose letter of the 28th October 1814 this passage appears, confirm the truth of the statement by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> observation:\u2014\"That this representation of the late Governor-General is not too highly coloured, would appear from the minute of Mr Lumsden, and the reports of Mr Secretary Dowdeswell, forming also part of the proceedings in regard to Mr Ernst.\"\n\nThe new scheme of organizing a body of professed spies in the service of the public, while, in some cases, it was of public benefit, was, in other respects, highly detrimental to the peace of the community. Those spies, and more especially their superintendents (girdwars), became, in many cases, the pests of society. They took advantage of the power which they possessed of apprehending suspected persons, to extort money from them; and frequently, under threats of immediate apprehension, they laid under contribution all classes indiscriminately. It is stated, in a letter of the Directors, dated October 1814, on the authority of Mr Dick, a circuit judge, that \"whole villages are put under contribution, or subjected to the rapacity and slyful machinations of the vilest members of society.\"\u2020 In some cases, the innocent were brought to trial, and convicted, on suborned evidence, procured by these wretches.\n\nAmong the other causes of these evils may be enumerated the incapacity of Europeans to officiate as judges in a society so peculiarly constituted as that of India, with the usages and manners of which, as well as with the general character of the people, they remain to this day in a great measure unacquainted. This is a fact which is deeply regretted by all the most experienced servants of the Company, from Sir John Shore downwards. Europeans are sent out to India with the sole view of amassing a fortune. They have no interest in the country from which they draw such important benefits. They know nothing of its habits and manners\u2014never mixing with the natives in their ordinary business or amusements\u2014and never attaining to more than a theoretical knowledge of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>. With such qualifications, they begin to officiate as judges, how miserably ill-appointed for such an office their own experience quickly teaches them. They soon find the difficulty of appreciating or understanding even the most ordinary transactions of a society, with the rules and principles of which they are entirely unacquainted. What is intelligible by intuition to a native is a mystery to them; and it is easy to conceive how these difficulties must be accumulated on them in any long process of criminal judicature, involving a train of circumstantial, and frequently of contradictory evidence. It is not, as every one knows, on the mere naked testimony of a witness that a judge entirely relies; it is the tone, the manner, the living evidence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> and character, which impresses upon testimony the stamp of truth; which carries conviction to the mind; and saves a judge from the miserable dilemma of being blown about by every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> of opposite evidence. These discriminations are, however, far too nice for a European judge in an Indian court, and he frequently knows not what to believe. He cannot, by any judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, extort the truth from contradictory witnesses. In any train of questions involving the peculiar usages of the country, his stock of knowledge is soon exhausted. A story which hangs together in all its main circumstances, may yet be inconsistent in some of its minute and delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. But a European can never detect inconsistencies which are wrapt up in the veil of local manners. He lies, in this manner, at the mercy of every perjured witness who chooses to practise upon his ignorance. The truth of this statement is illustrated and confirmed by the concurring reports of many of those who have acted in this trying situation. Sir Henry Strachey, whose reports to the supreme government abound in most just, enlightened, and comprehensive views of Indian society and manners, observes, that \"nothing is more common,\n\n---\n\n* See Papers relating to the Police and to the Administration of Civil and Criminal Justice in Bengal, Fort George, &c. from 1810 to the present time, printed in 1819, p. 24.\n\n\u2020 Papers printed by order of the House of Commons, 1819.\neven after a minute and laborious examination of evidence on both sides, than for the judge to be left in utter doubt, respecting the points at issue. This proceeds chiefly from our very imperfect connection with the natives, and our scanty knowledge, after all our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, of their manners, customs, and languages. Within these few years, too, the natives have attained a sort of legal knowledge, as it is called, that is to say, a skill in the arts of collusion, intrigue, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, and subornation, which enables them to perplex and baffle us, with infinite facility.\"\u2014\"We perhaps judge too much by rule\u2014we imagine things to be incredible, because they have not before fallen within our experience. We make not sufficient allowance for the loose, vague, and inaccurate mode in which the natives tell a story,\u2014for their not comprehending us, and our not comprehending them. We hurry, terrify, and confound them, with our eagerness and impatience.\"\u2014\"We cannot (says the same discriminating observer) study the genius of the people in its own sphere of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. We know little of their domestic life, their knowledge, conversation, amusements, their trades and casts, or any of those national and individual characteristics, which are essential to a complete knowledge of them. Every day affords us examples of something new and surprising; and we have no principle to guide us, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of facts, except an extreme diffidence of our opinion, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of inability to judge of what is probable or improbable.\"\u2014\"The evil I complain of is extensive, and, I fear, irreparable. The difficulty we experience in discerning truth and falsehood among the natives, may be ascribed, I think, chiefly to our want of connection and intercourse with them; to the peculiarity of their manners and habits, their excessive ignorance of our characters, and our almost equal ignorance of theirs.\" The following passage, from the same document, gives a striking view of the inefficiency of European judges. \"The evidence on every trial convinces us, that innumerable robberies and murders, that atrocities of the worst conceivable kind, are committed; and that very often the perpetrators are before us; yet do we find ourselves, from causes of the nature above described, constrained to let them loose again, to prey on society; or, at the utmost, to direct that they be discharged, on giving security for their good behaviour.\"\u2014\"The judge of circuit is from day to day engaged in trying large gangs for robbery and murder, and letting them go; and the country continues to be overrun with them, to a degree truly deplorable.\" (Answers to Interrogatories of Government, 30th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1802. Fifth Report.)\n\nIt is well known that, according to the rules of the Company's government, no European is allowed to acquire landed property in India, and that all colonization of the country is studiously discouraged. The European rulers of India could not possibly pursue a more weak and pernicious policy, by which all the other errors of their administration are aggravated; which marks their own jealousy of their subjects, and evinces a disposition to hold possession of the country by any means, however exceptional. The effect of the Company's government in India, as appears from the preceding review of its measures, has been to destroy the hereditary aristocracy of the country. All the great families have disappeared, under the rigid exactions of revenue to which they were exposed; their estates have been sold, and they are confounded among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the people. The extinction of this important order of men, and the want of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> influence which they possessed, is severely felt in every branch of the public management. The business of the revenue, the magistracy, and police, have, as has been shown, fallen into a state of almost irreparable disorder; and these evils are, by all the most experienced servants of the Company, and by the Directors at home, ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> and ruin of the ancient gentry and landholders, who had great authority and respect among the people, and who were universally looked up to as the guardians of civil order. On this subject, Mr Stuart, judge in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a> division, in a Report to Government, reasons with great force and clearness, and observes, that the extinction of the aristocracy \"may be traced throughout the country as one principal source of the disorders which prevail.\" (Fifth Report, p. 574.) The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, therefore, in the government of India, is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> the means of re-establishing, in the country, a body of resident gentry, qualified to undertake the management of its internal affairs; and for this purpose no policy seems so effectual as the encouragement of European settlers. If this policy were adopted,\u2014if Englishmen were allowed to acquire land, and taught to consider India as their home, they or their descendants would gradually become naturalised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>,\u2014they would be compelled to mix with the natives in their ordinary transactions, and the succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> familiar with the language, manners, and character of the natives, might be qualified for the important duties which are now so inadequately discharged. At present the government of India is composed of a small body of foreigners, who have no interest in the welfare of the country, and who only visit it for the purpose of engrossing, from their rightful owners, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> or profit. It is a strange, anomalous, and insolent domination of the few over the many; it has no tie of sympathy to connect it with the people; it draws no support from the natural feelings and affections of mankind, but derives its strength mainly from the knowledge of its power. It is a singular spectacle to see a whole people, through the agency of foreigners, excluded from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> competition for public rewards. A proscription so universal must produce the most unfavourable effects on the national character. By narrowing the sphere of ambition, we diminish the incentives to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> exertion\u2014we take away from mankind the motives which prompt them to cultivate their faculties\u2014we weaken the animating principle of all improvement\u2014we relax the moral tone of society, and thus pave the way for the progress of vice and disorder.\n\nAll accounts accordingly agree that the state of morals in Hindostan has not been improved under the rule of the English. \"The decline of morality,\" says Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOIRA\">Moira</a>, in his judicial minute, dated 2d October 1815, \"is stated to be a subject of reproach against us by all the natives whom birth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> have inspired...\"\nwith concern for the good order or well-being of society.\" This is imputed to the decay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> endowments and public seminaries; and to the decline, also, of those moral sanctions connected with custom, religion, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, which have been gradually relaxed under the ascendancy of the British law. But the monopoly of power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>, and honour, in the hands of a few, by constituting the majority a degraded class, must have also had its share in producing those unfavourable effects on the character of the people. Mr Stuart, (already alluded to, whose Reports on the state of India abound in the most masterly views of the state of property and manners,) expresses this opinion in the strongest terms: \"As we proceed (he observes), these provinces will soon present the singular spectacle of a great empire, the government of which rigidly excludes its subjects from every object of fair ambition, which, in the pursuit, could stimulate men to cultivate their faculties, or, in the possession, enlarge their understandings and elevate their minds. The natives may accumulate wealth as merchants; they may be proprietors of land; but these occupations, as they are managed in this country, have no great tendency to raise the character. Beyond them, with the rarest exceptions, there is nothing to which the people can aspire, higher than the command of a platoon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPOYS\">sepoys</a>, or the possession of some petty civil office, insignificant in its functions, and paid with a salary hardly adequate to a bare subsistence. My speculations may have perhaps misled me, but I am persuaded that very unfavourable effects from these causes, may already be traced, in the habits of our native subjects; and their long continuance must, I think, infallibly end in reducing the whole population to one ignorant, grovelling, litigious, and profligate herd.\"\n\nThe Directors of the Company in Europe, as soon as they were informed of these vices and disorders in their Indian government, displayed the most praiseworthy zeal in their endeavours to remove them. Far from blaming the freedom with which they were exposed, or seeking, by palliations, to evade the truth, they listened to the representations of their servants; and, in many cases, followed their judicious and enlightened suggestions. One of their first cares was to re-establish the vigour and efficiency of the police. It was soon found that the system established in 1793, not being connected in any degree with the institutions or local manners of the country, was ill adapted to its end; and that the subversion of the ancient establishments, on the ruin of which it was founded, had been attended with the worst effects, and had paved the way for all the disorders and evils with which the country had been afflicted. To restore the ancient institutions of the country is now, therefore, the policy of the government; and, for this purpose, they are endeavouring to revive, for the public service, the ancient array of village watchmen and zemindary constables, formerly disbanded. In many cases, their efforts have been attended with success. A new energy has been infused into the police; and this, joined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the local magistrates, has had the effect of diminishing the crime of gang-robbery; though, in some districts, this crime still prevails, and continues to spread dismay through the peaceful country. It does not appear that there has been any decrease of other offences, or that the morals of the people have been in any degree improved. This desirable effect, indeed, if it takes place, must be the work of time; and a long period must elapse before, even under the best institutions, the effect of former errors can be done away. For the improvement of the people, the village schoolmasters have been everywhere encouraged; and, for the same laudable purpose, other seminaries are about to be instituted. The civil courts, according to recent accounts, still continue to be overloaded with an arrear of undecided causes. To remedy this defect, assistant judges have been appointed; and it has been proposed to have recourse to the effectual assistance of the natives in the judicial business of the country. Those judicious arrangements, aided by the zeal of the Directors at home, and by the great ability employed in the local government, may certainly check those alarming disorders by which the country has been distracted. But the evils which afflict the Indian community have continued too long, and are now too deeply rooted, to be easily removed.\n\nFrom the year 1805, when a general peace was established by Lord Cornwallis, to the year 1813, when Marquis Hastings assumed the government, the political relations of the Company with the native powers had undergone little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The tranquillity which prevailed was, however, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> than real; and it was scarcely to be supposed, indeed, that the widely extending domination of a foreign power could long continue to be viewed without jealousy by the native princes of India. Such of them, accordingly, as retained any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of national honour, were naturally hostile to the British, and were well disposed to unite against them as the common enemies of Indian independence. In 1814 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the Nepalese commenced, and in the outset the reverses sustained by the British in their attempts to penetrate into the hill country, strongly excited the hopes of the native princes. In the following year, the valour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> talents of Sir D. Ochterlony brought that war to a brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; and the bravery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> displayed by the troops in the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, renewed among the Indian princes the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of their invincible superiority. Whatever might be their ulterior views, therefore, they were compelled for the present to temporize, and to soothe their conquerors by an outward show of humility and peace.\n\nA more favourable opportunity, as they conceived, soon occurred for successful resistance to the British power. From the constant wars and commotions in which India had from time immemorial been involved, it happened that a great proportion of the native population were trained to habits of disorder and military licence. At the general settlement concluded in 1805, it was naturally supposed that these bands of adventurers, having no longer any scope for their predatory enterprises, would betake themselves to pacific pursuits, and would thus be gradually dissolved among the mass of the people. It happened otherwise. Those hordes of freebooters, known under the general denomination of Pindarees in-\nproved both in strength and union, and Scindia and Holkar, in whose neighbourhood they were settled, if they did not openly abet them, made no active efforts for their suppression. The nature of their force may be shortly described. It consists of a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> cavalry, which was formerly attached to the native armies, in the same manner, and for the same purpose, as the Cossacks are to the armies of Russia. Their horses were trained to long marches and hard fare, it being their object to plunder the country, and to elude pursuit by the celerity of their movements. They were generally armed with a bamboo spear, from 12 or 18 feet long; every fifteenth man carried a matchlock; about 400 out of every 1000 were well mounted; of the remaining 600, 400 were indifferently mounted, and the rest were slaves, attendants, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>-followers, mounted on wild ponies, and keeping up with the corps as they best could. About the year 1814, these predatory bands comprised about 40,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, who followed plunder as their mode of subsistence, and were indeed a more formidable species of gang-robbers; but, like other robbers and murderers on a great scale, they assumed all the form and pomp of military array. The strength and numbers of this disorderly mass were daily increasing by deserters from Holkar's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> bands, and from the loose cavalry establishments of Scindia and others, where they were retained by no tie but that of present advantage, and where their pay was always in arrear.\n\nThe central situation of the Pindarees, at an equal distance from the three presidencies, rendered their hostility still more formidable, and enforced on the British the necessity of maintaining an extensive line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, which was always, however, penetrated by those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> hordes, and the territories of our allies exposed, in consequence, to annual devastations. In 1808-9, and in 1812, they carried their incursions into the British territories, and returned loaded with spoil. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of these successful exploits recruited their bands, and enabled them to extend their ravages. In October 1815, a force of 8000 Pindarees crossed the Nerbuddah, in a northwest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and, dividing into two parties, they penetrated to the Kishna, though they were watched, and one party was surprised by a body of infantry and cavalry, which did them, however, little damage. They were only deterred from crossing into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a> presidency by the swollen state of the river, along the fertile and populous banks of which they took their course, plundering as they went along, and committing every kind of enormity. In their return along the line of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GODAVERY\">Godavery</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WURDA\">Wurda</a>, they passed the British positions, making good their retreat with an immense booty, and with utter impunity. A second expedition was soon planned, which, crossing the Nerbuddah, appeared on the western frontier of the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MASULIPATAM\">Masulipatam</a>, under the Madras presidency, on the 10th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1816. Next day they made a march of thirty-eight miles southward, plundering ninety-two villages, with every circumstance of unheard of cruelty, and, on the 12th, they marched thirty-eight miles, plundering fifty-four villages. By the 17th May they had nearly all recrossed the Nerbuddah, loaded with spoil, and with scarcely any loss. During the twelve days that they had remained within the Company's territories, it was ascertained that 182 persons had been put to a cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, 505 were found severely wounded, and 3603 had been put to different kinds of torture.*\n\nIt now became necessary to adopt efficient means for protecting the country against these destructive visitations. For this purpose, a defensive line of posts was extended along the Nerbuddah, and across the country for about 150 miles. This was, as usual, soon penetrated by the activity of the enemy, and various expeditions advanced southward for the purpose of plunder. By the singular activity of the different corps, and by a train also of fortunate accidents, almost all of these expeditions were intercepted, broken, and discomfited, so that very few of the plunderers made good their retreat. It was resolved, however, in the year 1817, to commence offensive operations\u2014to attack the enemy in their native haunts, and either to exterminate them, or to drive them from the advantageous position which they occupied, in the very centre of India. The season of inaction was accordingly spent in making preparations for a great military effort; and, by the end of the rainy season of 1817, a numerous and well-appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> was ready for the field. The plan of the campaign was, that the armies of the different presidencies should advance southward, and gradually converging to a common centre, hem in, on every side, the devoted territory of the freebooters.\n\nBut, while this plan was in progress, it was interrupted, and part of the troops engaged in executing it were suddenly recalled, by the unexpected outbreaking of the native powers. Bajee Rao, the Peshwa or Prince of Poonah, who had long been impatient of the British yoke, availed himself of this opportunity to make a fresh attempt at independence. With a view of more vigorously prosecuting the war against the Pindarees, all the troops had moved southward, with the exception of a brigade which had been left at Poonah; and it was to overpower this small body of troops that the Peshwa's first efforts were directed. They were completely unsuccessful, however; he was repulsed at all points, by the steadiness of the Company's troops. This action took place on the 5th November. On the 13th, the British were joined by General Smith's division, which had advanced on the Godavery, on an understanding that, if he did not hear daily from the resident at Poonah, he should countermarch to that place. It was resolved to attack the enemy's camp next day, but it was found deserted. General Smith immediately commenced an unremitting pursuit of the Peshwa, who was hunted from place to place by the different corps of the British army, until he at length deemed prudent to surrender. He was deposed from\n\n* Narrative of the Political and Military Transactions of British India under the Administration of the Marquis of Hastings. By Henry T. Prinsep, Chap. i. and v.\nhis throne\u2014a residence in a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> was fixed upon for him; and a pension of about L.100,000 per annum assigned him for his support. His dominions were, of course, taken under the administration of the British.\n\nThe Rajah of Nagpoor, Appa Saheb, who was held in the same thraldom by the British, pursued a similar course, and with the same results. On the 26th November, at sunset, he attacked, with a great superiority of force, the brigade left at the residency, which was, in consequence, in great peril. A doubtful contest was maintained through the night, and next day the attack on the British was renewed with fresh vigour. Under every disadvantage, however, these attacks were finally repulsed, and the weak prince, Appa Saheb, taking fright, sent to ask forgiveness from his enemies. The conditions offered him were, that his territories should be placed at the mercy of the British government\u2014that he should give up all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>; disband his troops, and come in person as a hostage into the British camp; on an understanding, however, that if he acceded to these terms, the former relations between him and the British would be restored; it being at the same time understood, that he should cede part of his territory, and that due provision should be made for a greater degree of internal control over his future movements. Being threatened with an immediate attack, he came to the British camp with a few attendants. His troops, however, as if to shame their pusillanimous prince, fought an unsuccessful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> for his rights and independence; after which, the city of Nagpoor, with its fort, was surrendered to the conquerors, and this second war brought to a triumphant close. Appa Saheb, afterwards repenting of his spiritless conduct, began to plot new schemes; when he was arrested by the British resident, and detained in close confinement. He found means to escape in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of the following year, and making good his retreat to the hills, where, being joined by a band of irregular followers, he continued to give disturbance up to the latest accounts.\n\nIt had been the professed intention of the Anglo-Indian government, according to its usual arbitrary mode of treating the native powers, to force the two independent chiefs, Scindia and Holkar, into an acquiescence with its views in regard to the Pindarees, and also the Patans, a species of infantry, better appointed, and more regularly disciplined, than the Pindarees, but associated together on the same unlawful principle of indiscriminate plunder. Scindia had been compelled to temporize, and finally to accede to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>; Holkar, feeling strongly the disgrace of yielding to foreign threats, resolved to try the fortune of war. A battle took place on the 21st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, in which he was totally defeated, with the loss of his camp and all his artillery. He sought peace, which was granted him; but he was compelled to accept of British protection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>, which has always been accounted the last dishonour of an Indian prince.\n\nThe main object of the war, which was the destruction of the Pindarees, was not, in any material degree, impeded by those incidental contests. According to the plan proposed, the different divisions of the grand army proceeded southward, converging as they advanced for the purpose of surrounding their haunts, and preventing their escape. They were driven out of the province of Malwa, retiring as the British advanced, but were at length so effectually hemmed in, that, in attempting to retreat, they were intercepted at all points, and the greater part of them destroyed. The remainder were so humbled by fatigue and misery, that they were glad to submit on any terms, and at length the three chief leaders surrendered on condition that their lives should be spared.\n\nIt will now be proper briefly to revert to the General Commercial character of the East India Company, view of the Company's and to inquire what has been the general result of its transactions, considered merely with a view to profit and loss. So long as the attention of the considered in Company was confined merely to trade, the annual reference to dividend which, from the year 1708 to 1766, varied from 5 to 10 per cent. may be taken as a tolerably fair criterion of the profit gained. The acquisition, in 1765, of the sovereignty and revenues of Bengal gave rise among the proprietors to the most extravagant anticipations of wealth, and, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of these, the dividend, as already mentioned, was raised to 10 and afterwards to 12 per cent. These expectations proving fallacious, it was, in 1773, lowered to 6 per cent. It was afterwards raised to 8, and, in 1793, to 10\u00bd per cent. Ever since the acquisition of the sovereignty of Bengal, it was not so much from trade as from revenue that the Company's profits were expected to arise. It was by the remittance of a large surplus revenue from India, that the proprietors hoped to be enriched. These hopes, however, have never been fulfilled. A large and increasing revenue has been indeed collected; but it has been invariably followed by an increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>; and the debt in India, which began in 1769, has been gradually increased to the enormous sum of L.34,775,792, its amount in April 1818.\n\nThe constant increase of the charge is a standing subject of complaint in the correspondence of the Directors with their servants in India, whom they frequently accuse of the grossest profusion and corruption; reproaching them with the enormous expense of their establishment, and urging them, in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> manner, to retrenchments and economy; while the servants, on the other hand, always hold out the fairest promises of their future management, and flattering statements of revenue to be regularly overturned by the increasing charges of the succeeding year.\n\nWhen Lord Clive was sent out to India in 1765, it was for the purpose of securing the Company's revenue from the profusion and mismanagement of corrupt servants, against whom the clamour in this country was loud and general. No amendment, however, took place, and the Directors continued their complaints. During the ten years administration of Mr Hastings, which commenced in 1772 and ended in 1783, the Company were deeply involved in the wars and politics of India, the effect of which, on the finances, appears to have been to increase both the revenue and the charge, and in the same proportion to accumulate debt. In 1772 the revenues of Bengal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHAR\">Bahar</a>, and Orissa, amounted to L.2,373,650, the charges to L.1,705,279; produ-\ncing a surplus of L. 668,371. The India debt amounted to L. 1,850,166. In 1785 the revenues of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, including the new revenue of Benares, amounted to L. 5,315,197; the charges to L. 4,312,519; thus producing a surplus of L. 1,002,678; to counterbalance which, however, the debt in India was increased to L. 10,464,955.\n\nWith the management of their affairs in India, the Directors never seem to have been satisfied; for we find them about this period complaining that certain late revenue regulations were made, \"rather with a view of creating lucrative posts for a certain description of men, than with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> either of increasing the revenue, or of promoting commerce.\" In the same strain we find them complaining in a letter to Lord Cornwallis of a disposition in their servants to \"innovation and experiment, without urgent necessity, or apparent cause, new institutions, and almost instant deviations from them, multiplication of offices, and increase of salaries.\" These, they continue, \"are always introduced with flattering schemes of increase to the revenue and diminution of expence, which has hardly, in any instance, been realized by the event.\" In consequence of this constant increase of expence, though the Company's revenues were increased, the surplus revenue was diminished. In the same letter, the Directors state, that it was one million less than in 1766, when the Bengal revenues were acquired.\n\nIn 1793 the revenues amounted to L. 8,225,628; the expence to L. 7,007,050, thus yielding a surplus of L. 1,218,578; and the debt was reduced to L. 7,971,665. This state of the Company's affairs became the subject of the most extravagant declamations both in Parliament and elsewhere. The old delusion of Indian wealth, nearly as absurd as the South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a> bubble, was successfully revived; annual remittances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> were confidently expected and confidently promised; and the expected surplus was most gravely appropriated by acts of Parliament to its appointed ends. Mr Dundas was the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> in this solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a>, in which, being probably credulous himself, he imposed on the credulity of others, boasting that India would be a vast source of wealth to the Company, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. These predictions were soon falsified by the event. The surplus of Indian revenue, for the appropriation of which so many wise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> were passed, soon vanished, and in 1797, a deficiency appeared which continued till 1810. The revenues had, in the meantime, increased from L. 8,225,628, their amount, in 1797, to about 15 millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>; but, in place of any surplus being remitted from India to Europe, there appears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> against India, from 1797 to 1807, to the amount of L. 1,629,701; and it appears, that, during this period, there was sent from England to India, more than was received, a sum of L. 5,691,689. This was the sum, therefore, which England lost during those ten years, by its connection with India. From another account also, it appears that, from 1793 to 1816, England remitted of cash to India L. 8,824,067 more than was received. (See East India Annual Accounts laid before Parliament, p. 19.)\n\nIn 1811, the revenues began again to exceed the charges; and, in the three following years, there was a large surplus of nearly three millions Sterling in each year. In 1816, 1817, 1818, this surplus continued to be above two millions annually; and it is stated by Mr Prinsep, in his narrative of the last Indian war,* that there was actually accumulated in the different treasuries of the Company <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a> to the amount of eight millions Sterling. Here, then, was an opportunity for making a large remittance to the Directors in Europe. But of this great accumulation of treasure they received not one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>. The Indian government was involved in a series of new wars, in the carrying on of which not only was all this wealth expended, but an additional sum of about 4\u00bd millions Sterling was borrowed; so that the Indian debt, which, in 1814, amounted to about 29 millions Sterling, was raised to nearly L. 34,775,792, its amount in April 1818. Mr Prinsep, however, in his interesting account of the administration of Marquis Hastings, still confidently holds out the hope of a surplus revenue; and he finds his expectations, 1st, On a reduction of expence, in consequence of the peace recently concluded; and, 2dly, On a great increase of revenue from the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the Company's territories. It remains to be seen how far these expectations will be fulfilled.\n\nA general view of the Company's affairs discloses similar results. In 1772, after the possession of the Bengal revenues should have produced its full effect, the Company was involved in such difficulties that, on an estimate for three months of the payments falling due, and of the funds for their discharge, there appeared a deficiency of above L. 1,200,000. At this time the Company was assisted with a loan of L. 400,000, and afterwards of L. 200,000 from the bank, and with L. 1,400,000 from government. In 1773, from a general account of the Company's affairs, it appeared that their effects and credits in England, set against their debts, produced an unfavourable balance of L. 1,434,424, 19s. 8d. The same account of their effects and credits in India, set against their debts, produced a favourable balance of L. 4,364,993, 10s. 10d. Deducting the one from the other, the remainder, consisting of their whole available property, amounts to L. 2,930,568, 10s. 10d. which is all, therefore, that remained of their original capital, amounting to L. 4,200,000. According to a general account of the concern in 1793, this favourable balance was reduced to L. 1,956,866, less than in 1772 by L. 973,702; and to this we have to add an additional million of capital subscribed in 1789, at 17\u00bd per cent., amounting to L. 1,740,000; thus showing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a> of the Company's affairs, from 1772 to 1793, to the amount of L. 2,713,702. In 1810, the same general account showed a balance against the Company of L. 6,025,505; to which the Committee of the House of Commons, appointed at that time to inquire into their affairs, having added the capital stock received\n\n* Mr Prinsep has not told us on what authority this statement rests.\nin 1793 and 1794, and made several other adjustments, there appeared a balance against the Company of L. 11,062,591, which they had no effects to discharge. In 1813, this unfavourable balance had increased to L. 7,773,493; but in 1815, the Company's affairs were so far improved that it was reduced to L. 2,611,311. Adding the capital received, amounting to L. 7,780,000, the balance against the Company appears, at this period, to be L. 10,391,311.\n\nAlthough, at each successive renewal of the Company's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>, the mercantile part of the community have remonstrated against the continued monopoly of the Indian trade, it was not till the year 1814 that this trade was in any degree laid open to the merchants of this country. This was effected by the act passed in 1813, which, with the exception of the trade in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> trade, opened the general commerce of India to the merchants of this country, under certain limitations and restrictions. The Company was as tenacious as ever of their valued monopoly; they gave it up only when they found they could no longer retain it; and they still contrived to narrow, as much as possible, the freedom granted, by unfavourable restrictions. The trade with China, and the important trade in tea, was still continued under a strict monopoly: and, as a security against apprehended dangers to their dominion, from an unrestricted trade, it was provided, that no vessel engaged in the private trade to India should be under 350 tons burden; that no vessel should proceed to any place on the continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a>, without a special licence from the Directors, regulated by the Board of Control; nor to any place not on the continent of India, within the same limits without a special licence. The effect of these restrictions is greatly unfavourable to the extension of the Indian trade; as they exclude the British merchant from the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Sea, the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a>, all the numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> scattered in the Indian Ocean, and all other countries eastward of Malacca; with which the Americans and others, who are freed from these restrictions, carry on an extensive and lucrative trade. The rigid monopoly still held by the Company of the Chinese trade and the trade in tea, is severely felt by the British merchant; the effect of it being to exclude him from a most beneficial branch of commerce, engrossed, not by the Company, but by foreigners. The trade between China and Europe, in which tea, the great staple of the one, is exchanged for the manufactured products of the other, is chiefly carried on by the Americans, for whose benefit, therefore, and not for the benefit of the Company, the British adventurer is excluded from this trade. Such further relaxation of the Company's monopoly is, therefore, still anxiously sought for by the merchants of this country, as would allow them to enter into such branches of commerce as are at present entirely engrossed by foreign merchants; and these demands are so just and reasonable, that, on every principle, they ought to be conceded. It is doubtful, however, whether the Company will agree to soften, in the smallest degree, the harsh provisions of their pernicious monopoly.\n\nUnder all the restrictions imposed on it, however, and under all the difficulties incident to new undertakings, the private trade to India has increased to such a degree, that the shipping employed in it during the last six years has nearly tripled the amount of the tonnage in the service of the East India Company. The extent of the trade carried on in private vessels has also been gradually increasing, until it now regularly exceeds that of the Company, although the private merchant is still excluded from the trade to China, and from the tea trade. The value of the tea, exclusively imported into Great Britain by the Company, generally exceeds three millions Sterling. During the two years, 1818 and 1819, it amounted in each year to L. 3,062,734, and to L. 3,645,078. Still, however, with little more than L. 200,000 for this article in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of private imports, the value of the latter exceeded that of the Company's imports in 1818 by L. 4,905,846, and in 1819 by L. 505,115. The following account will show the progressive improvement of the private trade:\n\n| Year | Value of Exports by the Company, year ending January 5, | Free Trade, including Privilege Trade | Value of Imports by the Company, year ending January 5, | Free Trade, including Privilege Trade |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 1815 | L. 1,732,719                                           | L. 870,177                            | L. 7,227,663                                            | L. 1,061,892                          |\n| 1816 | L. 1,753,302                                           | L. 1,454,728                          | L. 7,154,130                                            | L. 5,769,459                          |\n| 1817 | L. 1,539,130                                           | L. 1,868,396                          | L. 8,555,912                                            | L. 5,703,912                          |\n| 1818 | L. 1,313,493                                           | L. 2,708,024                          | L. 7,361,802                                            | L. 5,097,748                          |\n| 1819 | L. 1,250,064                                           | L. 3,052,741                          | L. 5,192,804                                            | L. 7,098,650                          |\n| 1820 | L. 1,358,326                                           | L. 1,650,338                          | L. 5,792,405                                            | L. 6,297,519                          |\n\nThis account proves sufficiently what an important advantage would be conferred on Great Britain by setting free the commerce of India from the restraints imposed on it. The use of British manufactures is daily becoming more common, and there is no doubt that if more scope and facilities were afforded to the free trade, it would soon become beneficial and lucrative. And when we consider the commercial embarrassments under which the country has been long labouring, it seems but reasonable that every possible expedient should be adopted for the revival of its depressed commerce, and that, if the grievance of the Company's unjust monopoly cannot be entirely done away, the mischief should still be confined within the narrowest limits possible.\n\nThe article Bengal, in the Encyclopaedia, contains an account of that province.
