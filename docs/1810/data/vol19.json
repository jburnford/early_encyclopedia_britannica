[{"h":"ANALYSIS OF STONES","t":"&c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">Preliminary</a>, the other earths predominate; but if it remain in a powdery form, the aluminous earth is in greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>. The oxides of different metals are indicated by the colour of the mafs; when it is of a dark or brownish red, the metallic oxide is that of iron; a grey green colour denotes manganese; and yellowish green the oxide of chromium.\n\nBut there are some stones on which potash has a very feeble action, and in this case borax has been substituted for the alkali. This is the method which was followed by Mr Chenevix in analyzing aluminous stones. A hundred grains of sapphire in powder were mixed with 250 grains of calcined borax, and subjected to a strong heat in a crucible of platina for two hours. When the mass was cold, it exhibited the appearance of a greenish blue glaze, which adhered strongly to the crucible; but the whole being boiled for some hours in muriatic acid, it was completely dissolved; the earthy matter was then precipitated by means of sub-carbonate of ammonia, and the precipitate, after being well washed, was again dissolved in muriatic acid; and in this way the borax was separated. The remaining part of the analysis was nearly similar to that directed for other stones, excepting only that the alumina was separated from the potash by means of muriate of ammonia.\n\nBut to return to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> and farther treatment of the mass in the silver crucible, which after being removed from the furnace, and wiped on the outside, is to be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> capsule; it is then filled with water, and this water is renewed occasionally, till the whole matter is separated from the crucible. By this means a part of the compound of the alkali with the siliceous and aluminous earths, is dissolved, and with a sufficient quantity of water, the whole may be dissolved. Muriatic acid is now to be added till the whole of the mass is brought to a state of solution. This, however, will not be the case, if the stone be composed chiefly of silica. On the first addition of the acid, a flaky precipitate is produced, because the acid unites with the alkali, which held the mass in solution. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a> afterwards takes place, which arises from the decomposition of a portion of carbonate of potash, formed during the fusion; and the flaky precipitate is again dissolved, as well as the matter which remained in the form of powder at the bottom of the vessel. If the powder be silica and alumina, there is no effervescence; but if it contain lime, an effervescence is produced. The solution in the muriatic acid being formed, if it shall appear colourless, it may be inferred that it contains no metallic oxide, or at least a very small portion. An orange red colour shows that it contains iron, a purplish red indicates manganese, and a golden yellow, chromium.\n\nThe solution is now to be introduced into an evaporating dish of porcelain, and being covered with paper, is to be placed on a sand bath, and evaporated to dryness. Towards the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, as the liquid assumes the form of a jelly, it must be constantly stirred with a rod of silver or porcelain, to permit the acid and water to pass off, and to allow the whole mass to be equally dried; for it is in this way that the silica and alumina are separated from each other. The matter being reduced to a dry powder, add to it a large quantity of pure water, expose it to a moderate heat, and pour it on a filter. This solution may be denominated A. Wash repeatedly the powder which remains upon the filter, till the water with which it is washed no longer precipitates silver from its solutions. The powder remaining is siliceous earth, which is first to be dried between folds of blotting paper, and then made red hot in a crucible of platina or silver; and when it is cold it is to be accurately weighed. If it be pure siliceous earth, it is in the form of a white powder, is of a white colour, does not adhere to the fingers, and is insoluble in acids. If it be at all coloured, it shows that it contains some metallic oxide, and is a proof that the evaporation has been carried on with too great a heat. To separate the oxide, boil the silica with an acid, and then wash and dry it as before. This acid solution is to be added to the solution A, and the whole is to be evaporated to about the quantity of an English pint; then add to it a solution of carbonate of potash, till the precipitation ceases; and it may be necessary to boil it a few moments, to allow the whole of the precipitate to fall to the bottom. The whole of the precipitate being collected at the bottom, the supernatant liquid is decanted off, and the water being put in its place, the precipitate and water are thrown on a filter; and when the water has run off, the filter with the precipitate upon it is placed on the folds of blotting paper. After the precipitate has acquired some degree of coarseness, collect it carefully with an ivory knife, mix it with a solution of pure potash, and boil it in a capsule of porcelain. The potash dissolves the alumina or glucina, and the other substances remain in the form of a powder. This powder may be called B.\n\nAdd to the solution of potash as much acid as will saturate the potash, and also redissolve any precipitate which at first appeared; and then add carbonate of ammonia till the taste of it be perceptible in the liquid. The whole of the alumina is now precipitated in the form of white flakes, while the glucina remains dissolved, if a sufficient quantity of carbonate of ammonia had been employed. Filter the liquid; and the alumina remaining on the filter being washed and dried, and after being made red hot, and allowed to cool, is weighed. To prove its being alumina, dissolve it in sulphuric acid, and a sufficient quantity of sulphate or acetate of potash being added, the whole of it will be converted into alum crystals, if the earth employed be aluminous earth.\n\nTo separate the glucina, the liquid which passed through the filter is to be boiled for some time, and if the solution contain any of this earth it will be precipitated in the form of a light powder, which may be dried in the usual manner, and weighed. It is a fine, soft, light, tasteless powder, when in a state of purity; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of heat does not make it concrete, as happens to alumina.\n\nWe now return to the residuum B, in which may be expected lime, magnesia, and some of the metallic oxides. But if it be suspected that this residuum contains any yttria, it is to be treated with carbonate of ammonia, which dissolves the yttria, and leaves the other bodies untouched. The yttria being separated, the residuum B is to be dissolved in weak sulphuric acid, and the solution evaporated to dryness. Add a small quantity of water, which will dissolve the sulphate of magnesia, as well as the metallic sulphates; but the sulphate of lime remains undissolved, or if any part of it should\nPreliminary dissolve, it may be thrown down by adding a small portion of weak alcohol. After being made red hot in a crucible, it is to be weighed, and the lime will amount to \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of the weight. The solution containing the remaining sulphates being diluted with a large portion of water, a small excess of acid is to be added, and then a saturated carbonate of potash. The magnesia and oxide of manganese remain dissolved, and the oxides of chromium, iron, and nickel, are precipitated. This precipitate may be denominated C.\n\nAdd to the solution a solution of hydro-sulphuret of potash, and the manganese in the state of a hydro-sulphuret will be precipitated. Calcine the precipitate in contact with air, and weigh it. The addition of pure potash to the solution will precipitate the magnesia, which being washed, and subjected to a red heat, is also to be weighed.\n\nThe residuum C is to be repeatedly boiled with nitric acid, and then mixed with pure potash; and, being heated, the liquid is to be decanted off. The precipitate thus obtained, consisting of the oxides of iron and nickel, is to be washed with pure water, and this water is to be added to the solution of the nitric acid and potash. The chromium, if any be present, is contained in that solution, and is in the form of an acid. Add to the solution muriatic acid in excess, and let the evaporation be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the liquor become of a green colour; then add a pure alkali, by which the chromium is precipitated in the state of oxide, which is to be dried in the usual way, and weighed.\n\nThe precipitate containing the oxides of iron and nickel is to be dissolved in muriatic acid; ammonia is to be added in excess, when the oxide of iron precipitates; and being collected, washed and dried, is to be weighed. By evaporating the solution, the oxide of nickel will be also precipitated, or the whole may be precipitated by the addition of hydro-sulphuret of ammonia. This being treated in the same manner as the other substances, is also to be weighed.\n\nThe weight of the whole substances thus obtained being added together, and being compared with the weight of the matter originally operated upon, if the two be equal, or if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> do not exceed three or four parts in 100, it may be inferred that the analysis is nearly correct; but a considerable loss of weight indicates some error, and requires the analysis to be carefully repeated. If the same loss of weight appear, it may be concluded that the stone contained some substance which is soluble in water, or has been driven off by the heat. To ascertain the last point, a portion of the stone is to be broken into small pieces, and exposed to a strong heat, in a porcelain retort. If it contain water, or any volatile substance, it will come over into the receiver, and by this means the nature and weight of the ingredients separated may be ascertained. If nothing come over into the receiver, or if what is obtained be not equal to the deficient weight, it may be inferred that the stone contains some matter which is soluble in water.\n\nA fixed alkali has been not unfrequently found in simple stones; and to ascertain whether the mineral subjected to analysis contains any alkaline matter, different methods have been pursued. These methods we shall now describe. The stone being reduced to an impalpable powder, is cautiously heated repeatedly with sulphuric acid, and the mass is to be digested in water; and this solution being properly concentrated, is set aside for some days. The appearance of crystals of alum is a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> that the mineral contains potash; and the quantity of those crystals may be estimated at \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\) of the weight of those crystals; but if no crystals be obtained, the solution is to be evaporated to dryness, and the residuum exposed to a moderate red heat. Digest it afterwards in water, and add carbonate of ammonia, and filter; evaporate again to dryness, expose the residue to a heat of 700\u00b0, and redissolve it. The solution being properly concentrated, will give crystals of phosphate of soda or of potash, as the one or the other alkali is present. Potash may be discovered by adding to the solution of the salt, a solution of nitro-muriate of platinum somewhat concentrated. A yellow precipitate, which is muriate of platinum and potash, is thus obtained.\n\nKlaproth's method for discovering fixed alkalies in minerals is the following. He takes four parts of nitrate of barytes to one of the mineral to be examined, and fuses them together in a porcelain crucible. A spongy mass of a light-blue colour was thus obtained, and with the addition of diluted muriatic acid, was completely dissolved. The solution, which was of a yellow colour, was then mixed with a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid, by which the barytes is precipitated, and the muriatic acid expelled. The liquid is next evaporated to dryness, and the mass being digested in water, is filtered, and the sulphate of barytes and silica remain on the filter. The clear solution is saturated with carbonate of ammonia, and filtered a second time; and all the earthy and metallic bodies being separated, the phosphates of fixed alkali and ammonia only remain in the solution, which being evaporated to dryness, the dry saline mass is introduced into a porcelain crucible, and subjected to such a degree of heat as is sufficient to drive off the sulphate of ammonia. The residuum is then dissolved in water, and crystallized; and thus a pure, fixed alkaline sulphate is obtained, which is again dissolved in water, and decomposed, by adding acetate of barytes. The solution is then filtered, and the liquid is evaporated to dryness. The saline mass obtained is the acetate of a fixed alkali, which being exposed to heat in a crucible, became of a reddish colour. The carbonaceous residuum is then to be dissolved in water, filtered, and crystallized, and the salt thus procured is a carbonate of a fixed alkali, the nature of which may be easily recognized by the means stated above.\n\nMr Davy's method of detecting a fixed alkali in minerals, is different*. One hundred grains of the stone in very fine powder are to be fused for half an hour at a year strong red heat, in a crucible of platina or silver, with 200 grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BORACIC_ACID\">boracic acid</a>. An ounce and half of nitric acid diluted with seven or eight times its quantity of water, is then digested upon the fused mass, till the decomposition of the whole is completed. Evaporate the fluid to about two ounces, or one ounce and a half; by this means the filaceous earth is separated, which being collected on a filter, is to be washed with distilled water, till the boracic acid and the whole of the saline matter are separated. The fluid is then mixed with water that has passed through the filter, and evaporated to the quantity of half a pint, after which it is saturated with carbonate of ammonia, and boiled with an excess of this salt, till the whole of the substances capable of being\nbeing precipitated, have been thrown down. The solution being filtered, the earths and metallic oxides remain on the filter. Add nitric acid to the liquid till it acquire a strong sour taste, and evaporate till the boric acid appear free.\n\nThe fluid is then to be filtered, and evaporated to dryness, and the dry mass being exposed to a heat of about 450\u00b0 Fahrenheit, the nitrate of ammonia is decomposed, and the nitrate of potash or soda remains behind.\n\nTo detect fluoric acid, which has been sometimes met with as a component part of stones, Klaproth heats the mineral with sulphuric acid in a glass retort, the corrosion of which, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of silica in the water of the receiver, are certain tests of fluoric acid.\n\nAfter the general observations which have now been offered, we proceed to give examples of the analysis of minerals belonging to the different genera of earths and stones; and we shall follow the same order in which those genera are described in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINERALOGY\">MINERALOGY</a>.\n\n1. ZIRCON Genus.\n\nThe mineral affording the earth which characterizes this genus, was analyzed by Klaproth in the following manner*. We select that species which is called hyacinth.\n\nA. 100 grains of hyacinth being levigated in the flint-mortar, received an increase of weight of half a grain.\n\nB. This pulverized hyacinth, digested with two ounces of nitro-muriatic acid, yielded, upon saturating the solution with potash, a light-brown precipitate, of three grains and a half, when dried. Ammonia, added to it, dissolved nothing; and it remained colourless. After the precipitate had been again separated from the volatile alkali, muriatic acid was added, which dissolved its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a> contents, leaving a white earth behind, which, when ignited, weighed 1\u00bd grain. The portion of iron, precipitated by caustic ammonia from the muriatic solution, weighed half a grain, when ignited, and became black and resplendent. It was fused with a neutral phosphate, upon charcoal, to find whether it contained manganese; no trace was perceptible.\n\nC. The above 1\u00bd grains of earth B were now added again to the hyacinth, after treatment with acids. The stone was then subjected to red heat, with five times its quantity of caustic alkali, in the manner explained in the essay on the jargon of Ceylon; the ignited mass was again liquefied with water; and the earth remaining after this process weighed 123 grains, when collected, edulcorated, and dried.\n\nD. The alkaline lixivium was then saturated with muriatic acid, and evaporated. At first it continued clear; but towards the end siliceous earth separated, the quantity of which, after ignition, amounted to six grains.\n\nE. To the 123 grains, previously well washed with water, a sufficient quantity of muriatic acid was added; which, with the assistance of heat, dissolved nearly the whole, a trifling residue excepted. This muriatic solution, evaporated in a moderate heat to a sixth or eighth part, lost its fluidity, and formed a limpid gelatinous coagulum. It was then covered with water, and exposed, with repeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, to a digesting heat.\n\nBy this management, the siliceous earth separated in slimy, intumesced grains, and weighed, after ignition, 23\u00bd grains.\n\nF. The solution, thus freed from its silica, was now saturated with a boiling ley of mild alkali; and the precipitate was washed and dried in the air. This last weighed 114 grains, proving, upon every trial, to be jargonic earth. A fourth part of it, heated to redness, weighed 16\u00bd grains; which make the whole amount to 66 grains.\n\nG. The above fix grains D, with the 23\u00bd grains E, in the whole 29\u00bd grains of siliceous earth, were ignited with a quadruple weight of vegetable alkali. When this mass had been again softened with water, it left a residue, which was extracted by muriatic acid. From this muriatic solution, also, when saturated with potash, jargonic earth fell down, weighing four grains after ignition. Hence, subtracting these, the quantity of siliceous earth is reduced to 25\u00bd grains.\n\nOne hundred parts of hyacinth, therefore, have given\n\n| Jargonite | F | 66 |\n|-----------|---|----|\n| Silica    | G | 4  |\n| Subtract  | A | 25\u00bd|\n| Oxide of iron | B | 0.50 |\n\nLo's 95.50\n\n2. Of the Siliceous Genus.\n\nA great proportion of the stones belonging to this genus are transparent, and have a vitreous appearance. They are so hard as to scratch glass, and, excepting the fluoric acid, they are not acted upon by acids. By fusion with alkalies they form glass; they also enter into fusion with boracic acid, and the acid of phosphorus. Stones composed chiefly of pure silica, are transparent and colourless. When a mineral is presented for examination, even if it possesses most of the properties which characterize stones belonging to this genus, some preliminary processes may be pursued to ascertain farther its nature and component parts.\n\nA. It is sometimes difficult to reduce siliceous stones to a fine powder. To facilitate this operation, a portion of the stone may be heated to redness, and in this state suddenly plunged into cold water. If by the first heating it is not sufficiently brittle, the operation may be repeated until the mineral can be reduced to a fine powder, as already directed.\n\nB. One part of the stone in fine powder is now to be mixed with four or five parts of potash, dissolved in the same quantity of water. The mixture is introduced into a silver crucible, and evaporated to dryness, stirring it constantly with a silver rod, according to the directions given above. The mass being evaporated to dryness, the heat is to be gradually increased, till the crucible appears of a dull red heat, or till the mass enters into quiet fusion. In this state it is kept for an hour.\n\nC. Remove the crucible from the fire before it is completely cold; soften the mass with water, by adding fresh...\nfresh portions from time to time, till the whole is detached from the crucible, and then add 12 times its bulk of water to effect a solution. If the stone consisted chiefly of siliceous earth, the greater part of the mass will be dissolved.\n\nD. Add muriatic acid till no farther precipitate is effected, and without separating the precipitate, evaporate the whole to dryness.\n\nE. Pour six times its bulk of muriatic acid, previously diluted with four parts of water, on the dry mass; boil the mixture for half an hour; let the insoluble part subside, and then collect it on a filter, and after being dried, subject it in a crucible to a red heat. This powder is the siliceous earth contained in the mineral.\n\nBut stones included under this genus contain very different proportions, not only of siliceous earth, but also of the other earths; and some of them even contain a far greater proportion of other earths than that which characterizes the genus under which they are arranged.\n\nAnalysis of Leucite.\n\nThe analysis of this mineral is particularly interesting, not only as Klaproth first detected it in potash, which was supposed to belong exclusively to the vegetable kingdom, and hence called vegetable alkali, but also as it places the skill and address of that eminent chemist in its examination in a very conspicuous light. The process was conducted in the following manner:\n\nIgnited alone upon charcoal, the leucite is completely infusible. It undergoes no manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, and its splinters lose nothing of their lustre.\n\nA small fragment, put into fused borax, is for a long time moved about in it before it dissolves, which it does by degrees; and the glass globe obtained is clear and light-brown.\n\nBy fusion with a neutral phosphate, the solution is still slower, and a colourless racy glass pearl is produced.\n\nOne hundred grains of coarsely pounded leucite exposed for an hour to a strong red heat, in a small porcelain pot, lost of weight only one-eighth of a grain, and even the violent heat of the porcelain furnace produced in the leucite only an inconsiderable change.\n\nA. One hundred grains of leucite, reduced to an impalpable powder, being several times digested in muriatic acid, dissolved a considerable part. A siliceous residue of 54 grains remained after ignition.\n\nB. The siliceous earth ignited with twice its weight of caustic alkali, softened again with water, covered with muriatic acid, added to excess of saturation, and, after sufficient digestion with this last, being collected on the filter, and heated to redness, was found to have lost little of its weight.\n\nC. Prussian blue added to the muriatic solution produced a precipitate which indicated one-eighth of a grain of oxide of iron.\n\nD. The solution by caustic ammonia being decomposed, and the precipitate being separated, the remaining liquor was tried with carbonate of soda, but no further change was effected.\n\nE. The precipitate produced by means of pure ammonia D was first dried. It was next purified by digesting it with distilled vinegar, and afterwards neutralizing this acid by ammonia. It weighed 24 grains and a half, when edulcorated and ignited. Diluted sulphuric acid completely dissolved it to a limpid liquor, and when properly treated, the solution yielded only alum.\n\nF. To obtain the earth, which possibly might have remained latent in the several washings, the whole were evaporated to dryness. After having re-dissolved the saline mass in water, the remaining portion of earth was collected, it amounted only to half a grain, and was siliceous earth.\n\nThere were therefore obtained,\n\n| Silica | (A) | 54 |\n|--------|-----|----|\n| Alumina| (E) | 54 |\n\nThe remarkable loss of more than one-fifth of the whole weight of the mineral under examination, excited suspicion that some error had crept into the analysis, and led to a repetition of the experiments, by varying the processes as follows.\n\nA. One hundred grains of leucite in fine powder were ignited for half an hour, with double their weight of caustic potash. To the mass softened with water muriatic acid was added, just to the point of saturation, and the mixture being filtered, the remaining undissolved residuum was washed and dried.\n\nB. The mineral thus prepared for decomposition, was then treated with muriatic acid, and kept for some time at a boiling heat. By this process a quantity of silica separated, which after being heated to redness weighed 54 grains and a half.\n\nC. Oxalate of potash being added to the muriatic solution, concentrated by evaporation, produced no turbidity. The alumina was separated by the same means as in the former experiments, and its weight amounted to nearly the same. By other trials it did not appear to have any mixture of other earths, and no other earth could be obtained by evaporating the waters with which the powders had been washed.\n\nThus, after varying the experiments, the same results were obtained, and the same loss still appeared. In the farther prosecution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, the following experiments were had recourse to.\n\nA. Two hundred grains of leucite in fine powder were repeatedly digested with muriatic acid, and the siliceous earth collected on the filter, washed, and weighed after being red hot, amounted to 109 grains.\n\nB. The muriatic solution was of a yellowish colour, and being reduced by evaporation in a land heat to the consistence of honey, the surface appeared covered with a saline crust; and when completely cooled, the mass appeared like a thick clear oil, of a golden yellow colour, and full of crystals, some of which were of a cubic, and some of a tabular form. The yellow fluid was gently poured off, and the salt rinsed with small portions of alcohol. The solution diluted with alcohol was again evaporated, and the small portion of salt thus obtained.\ntained was again washed with alcohol, and added to the first. The whole of the salt being dried, weighed 70 grains. This was dissolved in water, and some drops of a solution of ammonia being added, thrown down some particles of alumina. The solution being crystallized in a warm place, yielded only cubical crystals, some of which were elongated to four-sided columns.\n\nC. That part of the muriatic solution which shot into crystals being diluted with water, and decomposed in a boiling heat, by carbonate of soda, yielded a precipitate, which after washing, drying, and ignition, amounted to 47\u00bd grains of aluminous earth. Three times its weight of concentrated sulphuric acid was added, and the mixture was evaporated nearly to dryness. The mass was again dissolved in water, and combined with a solution of acetate of potash, which being crystallized, produced only alum.\n\nD. The siliceous earth A was mixed with double its weight of potash, and subjected to a strong red heat for an hour. The mass was reduced to powder, and diluted with water. Muriatic acid was added in excess, and digested with it. The filtered muriatic solution being saturated with soda yielded 1\u00bd grain of aluminous earth, after which there remained of silica 107\u00bd grains.\n\nThe 200 grains of leucite have thus afforded of\n\n| Silica D | Alumina C |\n|----------|-----------|\n| 107.50   | 47.75     |\n\nHere there was still a deficiency of 43.25 grains, to account for which the 70 grains of salt B must be examined. This examination was conducted in the following manner:\n\n1. The taste and figure of the crystals were found to be the same with those of muriate of potash.\n2. The solution produced no change in vegetable blues, or in red-lened litmus paper.\n3. When heated to dryness, the salt made a crackling noise, and remained fixed in the fire.\n4. Neither carbonate of soda nor caustic ammonia produced any turbidity in the solution.\n5. Two parts of strong sulphuric acid were added to three of the salt, and the muriatic acid being driven off by heat, the mass was again dissolved in water, which afforded crystals of sulphate of potash.\n6. The remaining portion of salt was dissolved in a small quantity of water, and to this was added a concentrated solution of crystallized acid of tartar. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDULOUS\">acidulous</a> tartrate of potash (cream of tartar) was thus immediately produced and precipitated in the form of fand. This was washed, dried, burnt in a silver crucible, and the coal obtained repeatedly washed with water. The solution being evaporated to dryness, after being examined by the proper tests, appeared to be a carbonate of potash, which being saturated with nitric acid, afforded nitrate of potash.\n\nThus it appears that the base of the 70 grams of salt consisted entirely of pure potash, which was neutralized by part of the muriatic acid employed in decomposing the mineral; and according to the proportion of base in muriate of potash, the 70 grams A contain 42.7 grams of alkali; and in this way the deficiency in the examination of the leucite is accounted for.\n\nThe result of the analysis is as follows:\n\n| Silica | Alumina | Potash |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| 53.75  | 24.02   | 21.35  |\n\n129.72\n\nAnalysis of Pitchstone.\n\nThe pitchstone which is the subject of the following analysis, also conducted by Klaproth, is the transparent yellowish or olive green variety of that mineral from Meissen. It affords an example of soda, the other fixed alkali, forming a component part of stones.\n\nA. 100 grains in coarse fragments were introduced into a covered crucible, and were subjected to a red heat for half an hour. When taken from the fire they appeared of a white gray mixed with a yellowish colour, and having a rough feel, with something of the appearance of glazing. They lost 8\u00bd grains of weight.\n\nB. In the heat of a porcelain furnace, the pitchstone was fused both in the clay and charcoal crucible, and was converted into a clear glass, full of small froth holes.\n\nC. 100 grains of pitchstone in fine powder were treated with a solution of 200 grams of caustic soda, and being put into a silver crucible, were kept for half an hour in a pretty strong red heat. The mass was then softened with water; muriatic acid was added in excess; the solution was evaporated in a fand heat, nearly to dryness; water was again poured upon it, after which it was filtered, and 73 grams of siliceous earth were obtained.\n\nD. Caustic soda was mixed in excess with the muriatic solution, and the whole was digested in a boiling heat, by which the precipitate formed at the beginning of the process was again dissolved; a brown residuum still remained, which being separated, the alkaline solution was neutralized, and precipitated with carbonate of soda. The precipitate, which was alumina, after being washed, dried, and heated to dryness, amounted to 13\u00bd grams. The whole of it yielded crystals of alum, with sulphuric acid and potash.\n\nE. The residuum which remained undissolved by the caustic soda D, was first dissolved in muriatic, and then united with sulphuric acid. Sulphate of lime was obtained, which was collected, and washed with diluted alcohol. By reducing the filtered fluid by evaporation to a smaller quantity, and combining it with sulphuric acid, another portion of sulphate of lime, which, added to the first, amounted to three grams, indicating 18 grams of pure lime.\n\nF. The fluid was now freed from the calcareous earth; the iron which it contained was precipitated by carbonate of ammonia, which amounted to one grain. The remaining fluid was evaporated to dryness, and water being added to the saline residuum, fine minute floes of oxide of manganese separated, but in no greater quantity than one-tenth of a grain.\n\nG. 100 grams of pitchstone in powder were mixed with 300 grams of crystallized nitrate of barytes, and heated to redness in a porcelain vessel, till the salt was entirely","sp":346,"ep":351},{"h":"ANALYSIS OF STONES","t":"&c.\n\nArgillaceous genus entirely decomposed. The cold mass was softened with water, neutralized with muriatic acid, and combined in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> with sulphuric acid, that the latter, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> of the mixture, and separation of the muriatic acid by heat, was still in excess. The mass was washed with hot water; the residuum separated by filtration; and the clear fluid was mixed with carbonate of ammonia in excess. The precipitate thus obtained was collected on a filter, and the remaining fluid was evaporated to dryness, and the portion of sulphate of ammonia subjected to a moderate heat in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> vessel, was driven off. A fixed salt remained, which appeared to be sulphate of soda. This was redissolved, and decomposed by acetate of barytes; the filtered solution was evaporated to dryness; the dry salt was heated to redness in a crucible of platinum. The saline residuum being redissolved, filtered, and again evaporated to dryness, yielded three grains of dry carbonate of soda, indicating 1/4 grain of pure soda. This being neutralized with nitric acid, gave crystals of nitrate of soda.\n\nThe 100 grains of the mineral thus examined consist of:\n\n| Substance       | Grams |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| Silica C        | 73    |\n| Alumina D       | 14.5  |\n| Lime E          | 1     |\n| Oxide of iron D | 1     |\n| Manganese D     | .10   |\n| Soda G          | 1.75  |\n| Water A         | 8.50  |\n\n99.85\n\n3. Argillaceous Genus.\n\nAs many of the stones included under this genus are composed of similar substances with those arranged in the former genus, it is obvious that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> is to be conducted in the same way. We shall therefore give one example of the analysis of a stone belonging to this genus, and the example is that of basalt by Klaproth.\n\nAnalysis of Basalt.\n\nA. Small fragments of this stone were subjected to a strong red heat for 30 minutes; the loss of weight was two per cent. and the mass became of a lighter colour, and more readily yielded to the pebble.\n\nB. Basalt exposed to the heat of a porcelain furnace in a common clay crucible, fused into a compact black brown glass, which in thin splinters was transparent. It also entered into thin fusion in a crucible of semi-inclined surfaces; part of it ran into the clefts produced in the fissures, and the rest was found crystallized in brown shining lamellae, which on the surface were striated, and cellularly concreted. In a charcoal crucible it was converted into a dull gray and finely porous mass, in which were inserted numerous grains of iron.\n\nC. To ascertain whether this stone contained soda, 100 grams of basalt in fine powder were mixed with 400 grams of nitrate of barytes, and were at first exposed in a large porcelain vessel to a moderate heat, and afterwards to a heat gradually raised to ignition. The mixture swelled up, and when the heat was increased, white fumes arose on uncovering the vessel, which led to a supposition that the soda was beginning to volatilize. The fire was then removed.\n\nD. The porous mass, after cooling and being reduced to powder, was drenched with water, and treated with muriatic acid. The whole entered into solution, and produced a clear yellow fluid. The solution was evaporated, and sulphuric acid was added gradually, till it was in excess. The sulphate of barytes was precipitated.\n\nE. The saline mass by filtration was reduced to dryness, and water was added, the sediment separated, and appeared to consist of the sulphate of barytes, and the filicose earth of the stone. The clear fluid was saturated with ammonia, and the precipitate which was obtained being filtered off, the neutralized liquor was evaporated to dryness, and then exposed in a porcelain vessel to a moderately intense heat, till the whole sulphate of ammonia was driven off. The fixed portion remaining dissolved in water, and crystallized, appeared to be pure sulphate of soda. This was dissolved, decomposed by acetate of barytes; the precipitate, which was sulphate of barytes, was separated by the filter, and the clear fluid being evaporated to dryness, the dry acetate of soda was heated to redness in a crucible of platinum; and in this way 4\u00bd grams of dry carbonate of soda was obtained, which is equal to 2.6 grams of pure soda.\n\nF. To separate the other ingredients, 100 grams of powdered basalt were ignited for two hours with 400 grams of carbonate of soda, in a crucible of porcelain; but with a degree of heat which did not produce fusion. It united into a yellowish, somewhat hard mass, which being reduced to powder, and softened with water, was neutralized with muriatic acid. It was then a little supersaturated with nitric acid, and evaporated to dryness. The colour of the dry mass was saffron yellow. It was dissolved in water, slightly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDULATED\">acidulated</a> with muriatic acid, and after being digested for a short time it was filtered. The filicose earth collected on the filter was exposed to a red heat, and being weighed, amounted to 44\u00bd grams.\n\nG. The muriatic solution being sufficiently diluted with water, was precipitated at the temperature of boiling water, by means of carbonate of soda. The precipitate being separated, was digested with a solution of caustic soda, and a dark brown residuum was separated by filtration. Muriatic acid was added in a small excess to the alkaline fluid, and this was precipitated with carbonate of ammonia. The precipitate obtained, after being washed and ignited, amounted to 16\u00bd grams. It yielded alum, when treated with sulphuric acid and potash, and was therefore aluminous earth.\n\nH. The brown residuum G was dissolved in muriatic acid with particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the precise point of saturation. Succinate of ammonia was added to the solution, to precipitate the iron; and the succinate of iron obtained, when perfectly washed and strongly heated in a covered crucible, afforded 20 grams of oxide of iron, which were attracted by the magnet.\n\nI. The iron being separated, the fluid was treated at the temperature of boiling with carbonate of soda; a white precipitate was obtained, which was dissolved in nitric acid; and sulphuric acid being combined with the solution, threw down sulphate of lime. This was separated, and the remaining liquor being evaporated nearly\nAnalysis of Stones, &c.\n\nArwillaceous Genus nearly to dryness, was again diluted with a mixture of water and alcohol. Another portion of sulphate of lime fell down, which being separated, was added to the former. The whole of the sulphate of lime was decomposed by boiling it with carbonate of soda in solution, and the carbonate of lime thus obtained, after being washed and dried, weighed 17 grains, indicating nine grains and a half of pure lime.\n\nK. Upon the fluid left from the last process, caustic soda was affixed; a slimy precipitate was formed, which rapidly dissolved in sulphuric acid, and communicated a brown colour to the solution. It was evaporated in a sand bath; loose brown flakes fell down at the commencement of the process, and these being separated by the filter, appeared to be oxide of manganese; the quantity estimated did not exceed one-eighth of a grain.\n\nL. The remaining portion of the fluid was evaporated to dryness, and the residuum was exposed in a small crucible to a strong red heat. It was again dissolved in water, and yielded a small portion of alumina coloured with iron, and contaminated with manganese. After ignition it did not weigh more than half a grain; but the clear solution was entirely crystallized, and afforded sulphate of magnesia. Carbonate of soda was added to the magnesian salt in solution, by which the earthy base was precipitated in the state of carbonate. It weighed six grains, which is equal to $2\\frac{1}{3}$ grains of pure magnesia.\n\nThe following is the result of the preceding analysis:\n\n| Substance       | Weight |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Silica F        | 44.5   |\n| Alumina G       | 16.25  |\n| I               | .5     |\n| Oxide of iron H | 20.    |\n| Lime I          | 9.5    |\n| Magnesia L      | 2.25   |\n| Oxide of manganese K | .12 |\n| Soda E          | 2.60   |\n| Water A         | 2.     |\n\nTotal: 97.72\n\n4. Magnesian Genus.\n\nBesides several of the earths detected in minerals belonging to the former genera, the stones arranged under this genus are distinguished by being combined with magnesia. We shall only give one example of the analysis of a magnesian stone.\n\nAnalysis of Steatites.\n\nThis mineral, which was found in Cornwall, was analyzed by Klapproth in the following manner.\n\nA. One ounce of the stone in small pieces was subjected to a strong red heat, by placing the glass retort which contained it in an open fire. A small portion of water distilled over, which was pure and tasteless. The mineral lost 75 grains of its weight, and became darker in the colour, and considerably harder.\n\nB. After being reduced to powder, it was carefully mixed, and heated red hot, with two ounces of carbonate of potash in a porcelain pot. The concreted mass was leavened with water, and digested with muriatic acid in excess. A white loose slimy earth was precipitated, which after being washed, dried, and subjected to a red heat, weighed 204 grams. It was pure silica.\n\nC. Prussiate of potash was added to the filtered solution, and produced a blue precipitate, which being collected, washed, dried, and ignited with a little wax, was found, after cooling, to weigh seven grains. The whole of it was attracted by the magnet. The portion of iron belonging to the prussiate of potash being subtracted, left $3\\frac{1}{2}$ grains of oxide of iron as a constituent of the mineral under examination.\n\nD. Carbonate of potash being added to the solution freed from the iron, precipitated its earthy ingredient. This, after washing, and gentle ignition, weighed 192 grains. These were covered with a proportionate quantity of concentrated distilled vinegar, and being digested in a low heat, were thrown upon the filter. The earth remaining on the paper, which, after being dried and heated red hot, weighed 93 grams, was mixed with three times its weight of strong sulphuric acid, and the mixture being evaporated in a sand heat nearly to dryness, the dry mass was dissolved in water and filtered; 26 grams of siliceous earth were thus obtained.\n\nE. In the sulphuric solution D, there still remained 67 grams of earth, which being precipitated by an alkali, appeared to consist entirely of aluminous earth.\n\nF. Ninety-nine grams of the first, 192 grams of the earthy precipitate D, were taken up by the acetic acid, which being precipitated by carbonate of potash, and the earth obtained being tried by sulphuric acid, was found to be pure magnesia.\n\nThis analysis shows that the 480 grams of steatites thus examined, afforded\n\n| Substance       | Weight |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Silica B        | 204    |\n| D               | 26     |\n| Magnesia F      | 99     |\n| Alumina E       | 67     |\n| Oxide of iron C | 3.75   |\n| Water A         | 75     |\n\nTotal: 474.75\n\nLoft: 5.25\n\nor 100 parts of the mineral contain\n\n| Substance       | Parts |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| Silica          | 48    |\n| Magnesia        | 20.5  |\n| Alumina         | 14    |\n| Oxide of iron   | 1     |\n| Water           | 15.5  |\n\nTotal: 99.0\n\n5. Calcareous Genus.\n\nThe analysis of stones belonging to this genus must be varied according to the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> into which the lime has entered. With regard to the processes to be followed in the examination of calcareous stones, they are susceptible of a natural division into such as are soluble in muriatic or nitric acid with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>, and such as are scarcely soluble in those acids, and do not effervesce. To the first belong all the stones called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, or carbonates of lime; and to the second belongs sulphate of lime, or gypsum.\n\nAnalysis of Carbonate of Lime.\n\nCarbonate of lime, whether in the form of lime spar, or in a less pure state, in the form of limestone, is soluble","sp":351,"ep":353},{"h":"ANALYSIS OF STONES","t":"&c.\n\nCalcareous Genus.\n\nWith <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a> in nitric or muriatic acid. When exposed to heat, it yields carbonic acid gas, and is converted into quicklime; and when fused with an alkali, does not form a uniform mass. But we shall give a short view of the processes to be followed in a more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.\n\nA. Let a determinate quantity of the stone be reduced to a fine powder. Digest it repeatedly with muriatic acid till no further action is produced upon it. Dilute the solution, throw it upon a filter, and, after drying, weigh the insoluble residuum.\n\nB. Let the remaining solution be diluted with 24 times its bulk of water; add sulphuric acid diluted; a precipitate takes place if the stone contained any barytes, the amount of which, after being collected and dried, may be ascertained by weighing.\n\nC. Add to the filtered solution, after the barytes has been separated, a solution of carbonate of soda, as long as any precipitate is formed. Collect this precipitate, and let it be so much dried that it may be easily removed from the filter.\n\nD. Affuse the precipitate with sulphuric acid till all effervescence ceases.\n\nE. Introduce the whole into a mixture of three parts of distilled water, and one of alcohol, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of eight parts of the mixture to the quantity of the substance previously dissolved in nitric acid. Let the whole be digested for some hours in the cold, filter the fluid, and dry the insoluble residuum and weigh it.\n\nF. The remaining solution is next to be decomposed by a solution of carbonate of potash, and the precipitate being collected, is to be washed, dried, and weighed.\n\nBy this examination, if the stone is to be ranked with carbonate of lime, the weight of the insoluble part E, after subtracting from it one-third, must exceed the weight of the insoluble parts A and B.\n\nAnalysis of Sulphate of Lime.\n\nAs this is insoluble in nitric or muriatic acids, its analysis must be conducted in a different manner.\n\nA. Let one part of the mineral, reduced to fine powder, be boiled with four times its weight of carbonate of potash, in a sufficient quantity of water for two or three hours; as the fluid evaporates, water is to be added.\n\nB. Introduce the insoluble mass obtained by the last process into a flask containing diluted nitric acid, and the whole being dissolved, let it be evaporated to dryness, and weighed.\n\nC. Add to the dried mass more than its own weight of strong sulphuric acid; apply heat, and let it be gradually increased till fumes cease to rise, and let it be again weighed.\n\nD. Let the insoluble part be digested in twice its weight of cold water; filter the fluid, collect the insoluble residuum, and dry it in a dull red heat. To ascertain the quantity of lime, subtract from the weight of the insoluble mass left (in C) 59 parts; what remains is equal to the quantity of lime.\n\nE. The quantity of lime also may be ascertained, by subjecting for some hours to a red heat, the insoluble mass B; for by this process it will be converted into quicklime.\n\nAnalysis of Fluate of Lime.\n\nIn the examination of this mineral, a quantity of it may be reduced to powder, and moistened with sulphuric acid, in a leaden or pewter vessel. The mixture being heated, fumes arise, to which a plate of glass being exposed, is soon corroded. In this way the fluorine acid may be detected, and the quantity of base may be ascertained by decomposing the mineral by means of sulphuric acid, and afterwards analysing the sulphate of lime, as already directed.\n\nAnalysis of Phosphate of Lime.\n\nThe analysis of this mineral may be conducted in the following manner.\n\nA. Let a determinate portion be digested in five times its quantity of muriatic acid, and let the operation be repeated till the acid has no farther action upon the residuum; decant the fluid, and then let it be diluted with water and filtered.\n\nB. Add to the muriatic solution, liquid ammonia; collect the precipitate which is formed, and after being washed and dried, expose it to heat.\n\nC. Add nitric acid to the precipitate till the whole is dissolved. Precipitate again by means of sulphuric acid; let the whole then be filtered, and let the insoluble residuum be washed with as little water as possible.\n\nD. Evaporate the filtered fluid to the consistence of syrup; the fluid thus obtained is phosphoric acid, if the stone examined have been phosphate of lime. The test of phosphoric acid is, that it precipitates lime water, and also forms precipitates with the solutions of sulphate of iron, and nitrate of mercury; but it does not precipitate the muriate or nitrate of barytes.\n\n6. BARYTIC Genus.\n\nAnalysis of Carbonate of Barytes.\n\nA. Take a determinate quantity of the mineral, and dissolve it in diluted nitric acid; take a portion of the solution, and add to it a solution of sulphate of soda. If a precipitate take place, by adding a small quantity of the salt to the solution of the earth, diluted with 24 times its bulk of water, it may be inferred that the base of the mineral is barytes.\n\nB. Let the nitric solution be evaporated to dryness, and exposed in a silver crucible to a white heat; the earth obtained is barytes, which is soluble in 20 times its weight of water; and after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, crystallizes into long four-sided prisms.\n\nAnalysis of Sulphate of Barytes.\n\nThis mineral was analyzed by Klapproth in the following manner.\n\nA. 200 grains were mixed with 500 grains of carbonate of potash, and were exposed for two hours to a red heat; the mass was reduced to powder, boiled with water, and the undissolved earth was collected on the filter.\n\nB. To separate the siliceous earth, the fluid was neutralized by muriatic acid, and evaporated to dryness. The saline mass was redissolved in water, and the silica remaining after being ignited, weighed 18 grains.\n\nC. The barytic earth, freed from the sulphuric acid B, was covered with water; muriatic acid was added; the whole was dissolved by digestion, except two grains of silica. The filtered solution was crystallized, and afforded muriate of barytes.\n\nD. The crystals were redissolved in water, and sulphuric acid was added to the solution, while any precipitate appeared, and the regenerated sulphate of barytes being","sp":353,"ep":354},{"h":"ANALYSIS OF STONES","t":"&c.\n\nBarytic being washed and dried, weighed 185 grains, but after ignition, only 180 grains.\n\nOne hundred parts of this mineral are therefore composed of:\n\n- Sulphate of barytes D: 92\n- Silica B: 9\n- C: 1\n\n100 *\n\n7. STRONTIAN Genus.\n\nAnalysis of Carbonate of Strontites.\n\nThis mineral was analyzed by Kluproth, in the following manner.\n\nA. 100 parts were dissolved in muriatic acid, diluted with half its quantity of water. Thirty parts of carbonic acid were driven off during the solution, which being evaporated, afforded crystals in the shape of needles; and these crystals being dissolved in alcohol, communicated to it the property of burning with a carmine red flame. This is the test of strontian earth.\n\nB. To ascertain whether the mineral examined contained any barytes, three drops of a solution of one grain of sulphate of potash in six ounces of water were added to the muriatic solution; no appearance of precipitate was observed till next day, and therefore it contained no barytes, as in that case an immediate precipitate would have taken place.\n\nC. Carbonate of potash was then added to the muriatic solution; a decomposition took place; and the carbonate of strontites was precipitated. This being subjected to a strong heat, the carbonic acid was driven off, and the whole of the remaining earth being dissolved in water, crystallized. After being dried, it weighed 69.5.\n\nOne hundred parts of this mineral therefore contain:\n\n- Pure earth: 69.5\n- Carbonic acid: 30\n- Water: .5\n\n100.0\n\nII. SALTS.\n\nThe analysis of minerals arranged under this class, is in general less difficult, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their easy solubility, than those already examined. We shall therefore give only one example.\n\nAnalysis of Native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">Saltpetre</a>.\n\nThis native salt was examined by Kluproth \u2020, according to the following method.\n\nA. 1000 grains of the native salt, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> and gypsum to which it adhered, were covered with boiling water. The colourless solution was gently evaporated; during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, tender needle-shaped crystals of selenite appeared, and the whole of the solution crystallized to a perfect prismatic nitre. The selenite weighed 40 grains, and the salt amounted to 446 grains.\n\nB. To ascertain whether any common salt could be detected in the mineral, the crystals were redissolved in water, and acetate of barytes was dropped into the solution. A precipitate was obtained, amounting to 26 grains of sulphate of barytes, showing that 18\u00bd grains of selenite were still combined with the neutral salt. A solution of nitrate of silver was added to the nitric solution, which produced a precipitate of 4\u00bd grains of muriate of silver, so that the quantity of common salt can only be estimated at two grains. The pure nitre is thus reduced to 425\u00bd grains. Kluproth suspects that the neutral muriate mixed with the native nitre, is rather a muriate of potash, than muriate of soda.\n\nC. The stony matters remaining amounted to 500 grains; muriatic acid was poured upon them, and produced great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a> with pieces of limestone. One hundred and eighty-five grains of white gypsum remained; and the sulphuric acid being separated from it, by boiling with carbonate of potash, the carbonate of lime remaining behind dissolved without residuum in nitric acid.\n\nD. The limestone taken up by the muriatic acid, weighed 304 grains. Being farther examined, it appeared to be calcareous earth, slightly contaminated with iron.\n\nOne hundred parts, therefore, of this salt contain:\n\n- Pure prismatic nitre B: 42.55\n- Muriate of a neutral salt B: .20\n- Sulphate of lime A B C: 25.45\n- Carbonate of lime D: 30.4\n- Lofs: 1.4\n\n100.00\n\nIII. COMBUSTIBLES.\n\nAnalysis of Coal.\n\nThe constituent parts of coal are carbons and bitumen, with some earthy matters, and sometimes a small quantity of metallic matter. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of earthy matters contained in coal may be ascertained by weighing a determinate quantity, and burning it. The nature of the earths contained in the residuum may be discovered by the processes already given.\n\nTo ascertain the proportion of charcoal and bitumen contained in coal, we shall describe the method followed by Mr Kirwan.\n\nIt has been found that a certain proportion of carbons or pure charcoal, detonated with nitre in the state of ignition, decomposes a given proportion of that salt; and it appears from the experiments of Lavoisier, that 13.25 parts of charcoal decompose 100 parts of nitre, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETONATION\">detonation</a> is performed in close vessels; but in an open crucible, a smaller proportion of charcoal is required, in consequence of part of the nitre being decomposed by the action of the air of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. According to Kirwan, about 10 parts of charcoal are sufficient to decompose 96 parts of nitre. Mr Kirwan also found that vegetable pitch and malta did not produce any detonation with nitre, but merely burnt on its surface; and that the same quantity of charcoal was required for the decomposition of the nitre, as if no bituminous substance had been employed. Since, therefore, bitumen produces no effect in decomposing nitre, Kirwan thought that the proportion of charcoal, in any coal, might be ascertained by detonation with nitre. In this way the proportion of carbonaceous and earthy matter in any coal being discovered, the proportion of bitumen which it contains may be estimated by calculation.\n\nIn the experiments on the analysis of coal, Mr Kirwan employed a large crucible placed in a wind furnace, and exposed to an equable heat. The coal was reduced to\nsmall pieces of the size of a pin head, and was projected in portions of one or two grains at a time, into the nitre, the moment it became red hot. This was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the detonation ceased.\n\nBy this process it appeared that 50 grains of Kilkenny coal were necessary to decompose 480 grains of nitre. According to the same proportion, 96 grains of nitre would have required for its decomposition 10 grains of coal, which is exactly equal to the quantity of charcoal that would have been required to produce the same effect; and thus it appeared that Kilkenny coal is almost entirely composed of carbonaceous matter.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of cannel coal, Mr Kirwan burnt 240 grains, till the whole of the carbonaceous matter was consumed; a residuum of seven grains and a half of reddish brown ashes, which appeared to be chiefly aluminous earth, was left, or about 3.12 per cent. Sixty-five grains and a half of this coal were found necessary to decompose 480 grains of nitre. Fifty grains of charcoal would have produced the same effect, and hence 66\u00bd grains of coal contain 50 of charcoal, and 2.08 parts of ashes, which being subtracted from 66\u00bd grains, leaves 14.42 for the quantity of bitumen contained in the coal. Hence the constituent parts of this coal are,\n\n| Charcoal | 75.2 |\n| Bitumen  | 21.68 |\n| Ashes    | 3.1   |\n\nFor a more particular analysis of combustible minerals, see Mr Hatchett's experiments, detailed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1804.\n\nIV.

Some have at once boldly asserted, from these and other phenomena, that the world is eternal. Others have had recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> deluge. Some, among whom is the Count de Buffon, endeavour to prove that the ocean and dry land are perpetually changing places; that for many ages the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> have been covered with water, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which the marine animals just mentioned were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in such vast quantities, that the waters will again cover these mountains, the habitable part of the earth become sea, and the sea become dry land as before, &c. Others have imagined that they might be occasioned by volcanoes, earthquakes, &c., which confound the different strata, and often intermix the productions of the sea with those of the dry land.\n\nBut for a view of the different strata so far as they are known; as well as for a view of some of the theories which have been proposed to account for the formation and changes of the earth, see GEOLOGY.\n\nMr Forster has given an account of some of the strata of the South-sea islands, the substance of which may be seen in the following table.\n\n**SOUTH GEORGIA.**\n\n1.

There begins the sand, formed in some places from small shells and rubbed pieces of coral; but in others the shores are covered with blackish sand, consisting of the former sort mixed with black, sometimes glittering, particles of mica, and here and there some particles of the refractory iron ores called in England Skim, the ferrum micaceum of Linnaeus, and Kall, the molybdenum spuma lupi of the same author. The plains from the shores to the foot of the hills are covered with a very fine thick stratum of black mould, mixed with the above-mentioned sand, which the natives manure with shells. The first and lower range of hills are formed of a red ochreous earth, sometimes so intensely red, that the natives use it to paint their canoes and cloth. The higher hills consist of a hard, compact, and stiff clayey substance, hardening into stone when out of the reach of the sun and air. At the top of the valleys, along the banks of the rivers, are large masses of coarse granite stones of various mixtures; in one place are pillars of a grey, solid basaltic; and, in several others, fragments of black basalt.\n\nFriendly Islands and New Hebrides.\n\nThe same with the above.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALLICOLLO\">Mallicollo</a>.\n\nYellowish clay mixed with common sand.\n\nTanna, a Volcanic Island.\n\nThe chief strata here are clay mixed with alumious earth, interspersed with lumps of pure chalk.

The sides of the hills composed of a yellow ochreous clay, richly spangled with small particles of cat-filber, or a whitish kind of daze, the mica argentea of Linnaeus. The higher parts of the hills consist of a stone called by the German miners geffelstein, composed of quartz and great lumps of the above cat-filber. The latter is sometimes of an intensely red or orange colour, by means of an iron ochre.\n\n\"From the above account, says Mr Forster, it appears, I think, evidently, that all the high tropical isles of the South sea have been subject to the action of volcanoes. Pyritical and sulphurous substances, together with a few iron-stones, and some vestiges of copper, are no doubt found in several of them; but the mountains of New Caledonia are the most likely to contain the richest metallic veins; and the same opinion, I suspect, may be formed of the mountains in New Zealand.\"\n\nIn the city of Modena in Italy, and for some miles round that place, there is the most singular arrangement of strata perhaps in the whole world. From the surface of the ground to the depth of 14 feet, they meet with nothing but the ruins of an ancient city. Being come to that depth, they find paved streets, artificers shops, floors of houses, and several pieces of inlaid work. After these ruins they find a very solid earth, which one would think had never been removed; but a little lower they find it black and marthy, and full of briars. Signior Ramazzini in one place found a heap of wheat entire at the depth of 24 feet; in another, he found filbert-trees with their nuts. At the depth of about 28 feet, they find a bed of chalk, about 11 feet deep, which cuts very easily; after this a bed of marthy earth of about two feet, mixed with rushes, leaves, and branches. After this bed comes another of chalk, nearly of the same thickness; and which ends at the depth of 42 feet. This is followed by another bed of marthy earth like the former; after which comes a new chalk-bed, but thinner, which also has a marthy bed underneath it. This ends at the depth of 63 feet; after which they find sand mingled with small gravel, and several marine shells. This stratum is usually about five feet deep, and underneath it is a vast reservoir of water. It is on account of this water that the soil is so frequently dug, and the strata so well known in this part of the world. After coming to the sandy bottom above-mentioned, the workmen pierce the ground with a terebra or auger, when the water immediately springs up with great force, and fills the well to the brim. The flow is perpetual, and neither increases by rain, nor decreases by drought. Sometimes the auger meets with great trees, which give the workmen much trouble; they also sometimes see at the bottom of these wells great bones, coals, flints, and pieces of iron.\n\nIt has been asserted by some, that the specific gravity of the strata constantly increased with the depth from the surface. But Dr Leigh, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, speaking of the coal-pits, denies the strata to lie according to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>; observing, that the strata there are first a bed of marle, then free-stone, next iron-stone, then coal, or channel mire, then some other strata, then coal again, &c. This determined Mr Derham to make a nicer inquiry into the matter: accordingly, in 1712, he caused divers places to be bored, laying the several strata by themselves;","sp":378,"ep":379},{"h":"CONCERNING THE DECOMPOSITION OF SOAP BY","t":"g the decomposition of soap by means of acids, we must observe, first, that all acids, even the weakest vegetable acids, may occasion this decomposition, because every one of them has a greater affinity than\nSoap may also be decomposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, as Lemeray has done. When first exposed to fire, it yields a phlegm called by him a spirit; which nevertheless is neither acid nor alkaline, but some water which enters into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of soap. It becomes more and more coloured and empyreumatic as the fire is increased, which shows that it contains the most volatile part of the oil. It seems even to raise along with it, by help of the oil and action of the fire, a small part of the alkali of the soap: for as the same chemist observes, it occasions a precipitate in a solution of corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>. After this phlegm the oil rises altered, precisely as if it had been distilled from quicklime, that is, empyreumatic, soluble in spirit of wine, at first sufficiently volatile and afterwards thicker. An alkaline residuum coal remains in the retort, consisting chiefly of the mineral alkali contained in the soap, and which may be disengaged from the coal by calcination in an open fire, and obtained in its pure state.\n\nAlkaline soaps are very useful in many arts and trades, and also in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> and medicine. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> utility consists in a detergent quality that they receive from their alkali, which, although it is in some measure saturated with oil, is yet capable of acting upon oily matters, and of rendering them faponaceous and miscible with water. Hence soap is very useful to cleave any substances from all fat matters with which they happen to be foiled. Soap is therefore daily used for the washing and whitening of linen, for the cleansing of woollen cloths from oil, and for whitening silk and freeing it from the resinous varnish with which it is naturally covered. Pure alkaline lissiviums being capable of dissolving oils more effectually than soap, might be employed for the same purposes; but when this activity is not mitigated by oil, as it is in soap, they are capable of altering, and even of destroying entirely by their causticity, most substances, especially animal matters, as silk, wool, and others; whereas soap cleanses from oil almost as effectually as pure alkali, without danger of altering or destroying; which renders it very useful.\n\nSoap was imperfectly known to the ancients. It is mentioned by Pliny as made of fat and ashes, and as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the Gauls. Aretaeus and others informs us, that the Greeks obtained their knowledge of its medical use from the Romans. Its virtues, according to Bergius, are detergent, resolvent, and aperient, and its use recommended in jaundice, gout, calculous complaints, and in obstructions of the viscera. The efficacy of soap in the first of these diseases was experienced by Sylvius, and since recommended very generally by various authors who have written on this complaint; and it has also been thought of use in supplying the place of bile in the prime viva. The utility of this medicine in other cases was inferred chiefly from its supposed power of dissolving biliary concretions; but this medicine has lost much of its reputation in jaundice, since it is now known that gall-stones have been found in many after death who had been daily taking soap for several months and even years. Of its good effects in urinary calculous affections, we have the testimony of several, especially when dissolved in lime-water, by which its efficacy is considerably increased; for it thus becomes a powerful solvent of mucous, which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> modern author supposes to be the chief agent in the formation of calculi; it is, however, only in the incipient state of the disease that these remedies promise effectual benefit; though they generally abate the more violent symptoms where they cannot remove the cause. With Boerhaave soap was a general medicine: for as he attributed most complaints to viscidity of the fluids, he, and most of the Boerhaavian school, prescribed it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with different resinous and other substances, in gout, rheumatism, and various visceral complaints. Soap is also externally employed as a resolvent, and gives name to several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICINAL\">officinal</a> preparations.\n\nFrom the properties of soap we may know that it must be a very effectual and convenient anti-acid. It absorbs acids as powerfully as pure alkalies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> earths, without having the causticity of the former, and without oppressing the stomach by its weight like the latter.\n\nLastly, we may perceive that soap must be one of the best of all antidotes to stop quickly, and with the least inconvenience, the bad effects of acid corrosive potions, as aquafortis, corrosive sublimate, &c.\n\nSoap imported is subject by 10 Ann. cap. 19, to a duty of 2d. a pound (over and above former duties); and by 12 Ann. stat. 2. cap. 9, to the farther sum of 1d. a pound. And by the same acts, the duty on soap made in the kingdom is 1\u00bdd. a pound. By 19 G.

Officers are required to enter and survey at all times, by day or night, and the penalty of obstructing is 20l.; and they may unlock and examine every copper, &c., between the hours of five in the morning and eleven in the evening, and the penalty of obstructing is 100l. Every maker of soap before he begins any making, if within the bills of mortality, shall give 12 hours, if elsewhere 24 hours, notice in writing to the officer, of the time when he intends to begin, on pain of 50l. No maker shall remove any soap unsurveyed on pain of 20l. without giving proper notice of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>. And if any maker shall conceal any soap or materials, he shall forfeit the same, and also 50l.

The maker shall weekly...\nweekly enter in writing at the next office the soap made by him in each week, with the weight and quantity at each boiling, on pain of 50l.; and within one week after entry clear off the duties, on pain of double duty.

Brown.\nnot only to understand, but even to speak with tolerable ease.\n\nIn 1531 he published his Latin \"Thesaurus;\" a work of great importance, which he laboured at for two years. The mark which he put upon all his books was a tree branched, with a man looking upon it, and these words noli altum sapere, to which he sometimes added sed time. In 1539, Francis I. made him his printer, and ordered a new set of elegant types to be founded for him. His frequent editions of the New Testament gave great offence to the doctors of the Sorbonne, who accused him of heresy for his annotations, and inflicted upon the suppression of some of his books. Although Henry the French king in some measure protected him, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> of these divines rendered him unhappy, not to mention the expense and loss of time which an almost constant attendance at court unavoidably occasioned, that in 1552 he abandoned his country and went to Geneva. Here he embraced the Protestant religion, and thus justified in some measure the suspicions of his theological enemies. It has been affirmed by several writers that he carried along with him the royal types, and the moulds also in which they were cast; but it is certain that he never afterwards made use of those types.\n\nBesides, is it possible that the author of so daring a theft could have been not only protected in Geneva, but even courted and honoured by the most eminent men of the age? Is it credible that such a crime could have been concealed for 60 years; or that Henry, the son and heir of the perpetrator, would have enjoyed the favour of the French king, if Robert Stephens had acted such a shameful part? If he was burnt in effigy at Paris, it was not for theft, but for having changed his religion. After his arrival at Geneva, he published an account of the dispute between him and the Paris divines, which does us much honour to his abilities as his Thesaurus does to his learning. He died in 1559, after a life of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> industry. The books of which he was the editor were not fewer than 360. Many of them were ancient classics in different languages. Several were accompanied with annotations which he collected, and all of them were corrected by collating manuscripts. He was so anxious to obtain perfect accuracy, that he used to expose his proofs in public, and reward those who discovered a mistake. His books consequently were very correct. It is said that his New Testament, called O Mirificam (because the preface begins with these words), has not a single fault.\n\nIt was Robert Stephens who first divided the New Testament into verses during a journey between Paris and Lyons. The advantages of this improvement are fully counterbalanced by its defects. It has destroyed the unity of the books, and induced many commentators to consider every verse as a distinct and independent aphorism. To this in some measure is to be ascribed the many absurd interpretations and creeds that have been forced out of that book.\n\nBy his last will his estate was left exclusively to such of his children as should settle at Geneva. He left behind him three sons, Henry, Robert, and Francis.\n\nCharles Stephens, the third son of Henry, was, like the rest of his family, familiarly acquainted with the learned languages. This recommended him to Lazarus de Baif, who made him tutor to his son, and in 1540 carried him along with him to Germany. He studied medicine, and practised it with success in France. He did not, however, forsake the profession of his family, but exercised it in Paris, where he became the editor of many books remarkable for neatness and elegance. He wrote above thirty treatises on different subjects, particularly on botany, anatomy, and history. He died in 1564.\n\nRobert Stephens, the son of Robert the first of that name, did not accompany his father to Geneva, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to profess the Catholic religion, and to reside at Paris. His letter was remarkably beautiful. He was made king's printer, and died about 1589.\n\nHis brother Francis was also a printer. He embraced the Protestant religion, and resided at Geneva.\n\nHenry Stephens, the remaining son of Robert, was born at Paris in 1528. He became the most learned and most celebrated of all his family. From his very birth almost he gave proofs of uncommon abilities, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> an ardent passion for knowledge. The Medea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a>, which he saw acted while at school, first kindled his love for poetry, and inspired him with the desire of acquiring the language in which that tragedy is written. He intreated his father not to condemn him to study Latin, which he already understood from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, but to initiate him at once into the knowledge of Greek. His father willingly granted his request; and Henry applied with such vigour, that in a short time he could repeat the Medea by heart. He afterwards studied Greek under Peter Daneius, who was tutor to the Dauphin, and finally heard the lectures of Tufanus and Turnebus. He became eager at an early age to understand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTROLOGY\">astrology</a>, and accordingly attended a professor of that mysterious art; but he was not long in discovering its absurdity. At 19 he began his travels, which he undertook in order to examine foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>, and to become acquainted with learned men. He spent two years in Italy, and returned into France completely master of Italian, and bringing along with him copies of several scarce authors, particularly a part of Anacreon, which before was thought lost.\n\nHe found his father publishing an edition of the New Testament, to which he prefixed some Greek verses. Soon after, he visited England and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>, where he met with John Clement, an Englishman, to whom he was indebted for the remaining odes of Anacreon. During this journey he learned the Spanish language, which was very much spoken at that time in the Low Countries.\n\nWhether Henry accompanied his father to Geneva or not is uncertain; at least he must have returned immediately to France, for we find him soon after established at Paris, and publishing the odes of Anacreon. In 1554 he went to Rome, and thence to Naples. This journey was undertaken at the request, and in the service, of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. He was discovered, and would have been arrested as a spy, had he not by his address and skill in the language of the country been able to pass himself for a native of Italy. On his return to France he assumed the title of printer to Ulric Fugger, a very rich and learned German nobleman, who allowed him a considerable pension.\n\nIn 1560 he married a relation, as is generally supposed, of Henry Scrimgeour, a Scotch nobleman, with whom he was intimately acquainted. She was a woman, as he himself informs us, endowed with the noblest spirit.\nStephens. spirit and the most amiable dispositions. Her death, which happened in 1586, brought on a disease that had twice attacked him before. It was a disgust at all those pursuits which had formerly charmed him, an aversion to reading and the sight of books. It was probably occasioned by too constant and severe an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to literary pursuits. In 1572 he published his *Thesaurus Linguae Graecae*, one of the greatest works, perhaps, that ever was executed by one man, if we consider the wretched materials which more ancient dictionaries could furnish, if we consider the size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of the work, and the immense labour and learning which must have been employed in the compilation. This work had been carried on at a greater expense than he could well bear. He expected to be reimbursed by the sale of the book, but he was unfortunately disappointed. John Scapula, one of his own servants, extracted from it whatever he thought would be most serviceable to students, and published it beforehand in 4th. By this act of treachery Henry was reduced to poverty.\n\nAbout this time he was much beloved by Henry III. of France, who treated him so kindly, and made him such flattering promises, that he resided frequently at court. But these promises were never fulfilled, owing to the civil wars which soon after distracted France, and the unfortunate death of King Henry himself. During the remainder of his life his situation was very unsettled. We find him sometimes at Paris, sometimes in Geneva, in Germany, and even in Hungary. He died at Lyons in 1598, at the age of 70. He was fond of poetry from his very infancy. It was a custom of his to compose verses on horseback, and even to write them, though he generally rode a very mellowing steed. His *Thesaurus* was his great work, but he was also the author of several other treatises. His poems are numerous: His Apology for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> is a witty satire on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>. His Concordance to the New Testament must have been a laborious work, and has deservedly endeared him to every Christian who wishes to acquire a rational and critical knowledge of the Scriptures. The number of books which he published, though fewer than his father, was great, and superior in elegance to anything which the world had then seen. A great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of them were Greek; he was the editor, however, of many Roman and even of some Eastern writings. His Greek classics are remarkably correct; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of them are Homer, Anacreon, Aeschylus, Maximus Tyrius, Diodorus Siculus, Pindar, Xenophon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a>, Herodotus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHOCLES\">Sophocles</a>, Diogenes Laertius, Plutarch, Plato, Apollonius Rhodius, Aeschines, Lyrias, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALLIMACHUS\">Callimachus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEOCRITUS\">Theocritus</a>, Herodian, Dionysius Halicarnassensis, Dion Cassius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, Apollonius, Xiphilin, &c. His temper in the latter part of his life is represented as haughty and severe, owing probably to his disappointments. He left behind him a son and two daughters, one of whom was married to the learned Isaac Casaubon.\n\nPaul Stephens, the son of Henry, continued his father's profession at Geneva. He was a man of learning, and wrote translations of several books, and published a considerable number of the ancient classics; but his editions possess little of his father's elegance. He died in 1627, at the age of 62, after selling his types to one Chouet a printer.\u2014His son Antony, the last printer of the family, abandoned the Protestant religion, and returned to France, the country of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. He received letters of naturalization in 1612, and was made printer to the king; but managing his affairs ill, he was reduced to poverty, and obliged to retire into a hospital, where he died in 1674, miserable and blind, at the age of 80.","sp":322,"ep":328},{"h":"SLICH","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METALLURGY\">Metallurgy</a>, the ore of any metal, particularly of gold, when it has been pounded, and prepared for further working.\n\nThe manner of preparing the slich at Chremnitz in Hungary is this; they lay a foundation of wood three yards deep, upon this they place the ore, and over this there are 24 beams, armed at their bottoms with iron; these, by a continual motion, beat and grind the ore, till it is reduced to powder; during this operation, the ore is covered with water. There are four wheels used to move these beams, each wheel moving five; and the water, as it runs off, carrying some of the metallic particles with it, is received into several basins, one placed behind another; and finally, after having passed through them all, and deposited, some sediment in each, it is let off into a very large pit, almost half an acre in extent; in which it is suffered to stand too long, as to deposit all its sediment, of whatever kind, and after this it is let out. This work is carried on day and night, and the ore taken away and replaced by more as often as occasion requires. That ore which lies next the beams, by which it was pounded, is always the cleanest or richest.\n\nWhen the slich is washed as much as they can, a hundred weight of it usually contains about an ounce, or perhaps but half an ounce of metal, which is not all gold; for there is always a mixture of gold and silver, but the gold is in the largest quantity, and usually is two-thirds of the mixture: they then put the slich into a furnace with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, and flacken, or the scoria of former meltings, and run them together. The first melting produces a substance called lech; this lech they burn with charcoal, to make it lighter, to open its body, and render it porous, after which it is called roft; to this roft they add sand in such quantity as they find necessary, and then melt it over again.\n\nAt Chremnitz many other ways are practised of reducing gold out of its ore, but particularly one, in which they employ no lead during the whole operation; whereas, in general, lead is always necessary, after the before-mentioned processes.

At a very early period, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> a strong inclination for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>; and this propensity being encouraged by a suitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, he employed those hours which young people generally lose by pursuing low and trifling amusements, in the study of nature, and contemplating her works. When about sixteen, he was attacked by a spitting of blood, which threatened to be attended with considerable danger, and which interrupted the regular course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> for three years; he had, however, already learned enough of physic to know that a malady of this kind was not to be removed suddenly, and he prudently abstained from wine and other liquors that were likely to increase it.\n\nBy strictly observing this severe regimen, which in some measure he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> ever after, he was enabled to prolong his life beyond the ordinary bounds; being an example of the truth of his own favourite maxim, that sobriety, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, and moderation, are the best and most powerful preservatives that nature has granted to mankind.\n\nAs soon as he recovered from this infirmity, he resolved to perfect himself in the different branches of physic, which was the profession he had made choice of; and with this view he repaired to London, where he hoped to receive that assistance which he could not find in his own country.\n\nOn his arrival in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, he entered himself as a pupil to the great Stafford, an excellent chemist, bred under the illustrious Stahl; and by his instructions he gained a perfect knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of the different kinds of medicines then in use. At the same time, he studied botany at the celebrated garden at Chelsea, assiduously attended the public lectures of anatomy and physic, and in short neglected nothing that he thought likely to prove serviceable to him in his future practice. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> merit, however, was his knowledge of natural history; and it was this part of his character which introduced him early to the acquaintance of Mr Boyle and Mr Ray, two of the most eminent naturalists of that age. His intimacy with these distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> continued as long as they lived; and as he was careful to communicate to them every object of curiosity that attracted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, the observations which he occasionally made often excited their admiration and obtained their applause.\n\nAfter studying four years at London with unremitting severity, Mr Sloane determined to visit foreign countries for farther improvement. In this view he set out for France in the company of two other students, and having crossed to Dieppe, proceeded to Paris. In the way thither they were elegantly entertained by the famous M. Lemery the elder; and in return Mr Sloane presented that eminent chemist with a specimen of four different kinds of phosphorus, of which, upon the credit of other writers, M. Lemery had treated in his book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, though he had never seen any of them.\n\nAt Paris Mr Sloane lived as he had done in London. He attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, heard the lectures of Tournefort, De Verney, and other eminent masters; visited all the literati, who received him with particular marks of esteem, and employed himself wholly in study.\n\nFrom Paris Mr Sloane went to Montpelier; and, being furnished with letters of recommendation from M. Tournefort to M. Chirac, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of that university, he found easy access, through his means, to all the learned men of the province, particularly to M. Magnol, whom he always accompanied in his botanical excursions in the environs of that city, where he beheld with pleasure and admiration the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> productions of nature, and learned under his instructions to classify them in a proper manner.\nHaving here found an ample field for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, which was entirely suited to his taste, he took leave of his two companions, whom a curiosity of a different kind led into Italy.\n\nAfter spending a whole year in collecting plants, he travelled through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol9.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a> with the same design; and passing through Thoulouse and Bordeaux, returned to Paris, where he made a short stay. About the end of the year 1684 he set out for England, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of settling there as a physician. On his arrival in London, he made his first business to visit his two illustrious friends Mr Ray and Mr Boyle, in order to communicate to them the discoveries he had made in his travels. The latter he found at home, but the former had retired to Essex; to which place Mr Sloane transmitted a great variety of plants and seeds, which Mr Ray has described in his History of Plants, and for which he makes a proper acknowledgement.\n\nAbout the year 1706 our author became acquainted with the celebrated Sydenham; who soon contracted so warm an affection for him that he took him into his house, and recommended him in the strongest manner to his patients. He had not been long in London before he was proposed by Dr Martin Lister as a candidate to be admitted a member of the Royal Society, on the 26th of November 1683; and being approved, he was elected on the 21st of January following.\n\nIn 1685 he communicated some curiosities to the Society; and in July the same year he was a candidate for the office of their assistant secretary, but without success, as he was obliged to give way to the superior interest of his competitor Dr Halley. On the 12th of April 1687, he was chosen a fellow of the college of physicians in London; and the same year his friend and fellow traveller Dr Tancerd Robinson, having mentioned to the Society the plant called the star of the earth, as a remedy newly discovered for the bite of a mad dog, Dr Sloane acquainted them that this virtue of the plant was to be found in a book called De Grey's Farriery; and that he knew a man who had cured with it twenty couple of dogs. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> he made on the 13th of July, and on the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> following he embarked at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a> for Jamaica with the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>, who had been appointed governor of that island. The doctor attended his grace in quality of physician, and arrived at Jamaica on the 19th of December following.\n\nHere a new field was opened for fresh discoveries in natural productions; but the world would have been deprived of the fruits of them, had not our author, by incredible application, converted, as we may say, his minutes into hours. The duke of Albemarle died soon after he landed, and the duchess determined to return to England whenever an answer should be received to the letter she had sent to court on that melancholy occasion. As Dr Sloane could not think of leaving her grace in her distress, whilst the rest of her retinue were preparing for their departure he improved it in making collections of natural curiosities; so that though his whole stay at Jamaica was not above fifteen months, he brought together such a prodigious number of plants, that on his return to England Mr Ray was astonished that one man could procure in one island, and in so short a space, so vast a variety.\n\nOn his arrival in London he applied himself to the practice of his profession; and soon became so eminent, that he was chosen physician to Christ's Hospital on the 17th October 1694; and this office he held till the year 1733, when, on account of his great age and infirmities, he found it necessary to resign. It is somewhat singular, and redounds much to the Doctor's honour, that though he received the emoluments of his office punctually, because he would not lay down a precedent which might hurt his successors, yet he constantly applied the money to the relief of those who were the greatest objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a> in the hospital, that it might never be said he enriched himself by giving health to the poor. He had been elected secretary to the Royal Society on the 30th of November 1693; and upon this occasion he received the publication of the Philosophical Transactions, which had been omitted for some time. He continued to be the editor of this work till the year 1712; and the volumes which appeared during that period are monuments of his industry and ingenuity, many of the pieces contained in them being written by himself.\n\nIn the mean time he published Catalogus Plantarum quae in Insula Jamaica sponte proveniant, &c.; seu Prodromi Historiae Naturalis pars prima; which he dedicated to the Royal Society and College of Physicians. About the same time he formed the plan of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISPENSARY\">dispensary</a>, where the poor might be furnished at prime cost with such medicines as their several maladies might require; which he afterwards carried into execution, with the affluence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> and other members of the college of physicians.\n\nOur author's thirst for natural knowledge seems to have been born with him, so that his cabinet of curiosities may be said to have commenced with his being. He was continually enriching and enlarging it; and the same which, in the course of a few years, it had acquired, brought every thing that was curious in art or nature to be first offered to him for purchase. These acquisitions, however, increased it but very slowly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the augmentation it received in 1701 by the death of William Courten, Esq., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who had employed all his time, and the greater part of his fortune, in collecting rarities, and who bequeathed the whole to Dr Sloane, on condition of his paying certain debts and legacies with which he had charged it. These terms our author accepted, and he executed the will of the donor with the most scrupulous exactness; on which account some people have said, that he purchased Mr Courten's curiosities at a dear rate.\n\nIn 1727 the first volume of Dr Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica appeared in folio, though the publication of the second was delayed till 1725. By this very useful as well as magnificent work, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">materia medica</a> was enriched with a great number of excellent drugs not before known. In 1708 the Doctor was elected a foreign member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, in the room of Mr Tichborne; an honour so much the greater, as we were then at war with France, and the queen's express consent was necessary before he could accept it. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as his credit rose among the learned, his practice increased among the people of rank: Queen Anne herself frequently consulted him, and in her last illness was blooded by him.\n\nOn the advancement of George I. to the throne, that prince, on the 3rd of April 1716, created the Doctor a baronet, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> title of honour to which no\nno English physician had before attained; and at the same time made him physician general to the army, in which station he continued till 1727, when he was appointed physician in ordinary to George II. He attended the royal family till his death; and was particularly favoured by Queen Caroline, who placed the greatest confidence in his prescriptions. In the mean time he had been unanimously chosen one of the elects of the college of physicians June 1, 1716, and he was elected president of the same body on September 32, 1719, an office which he held for sixteen years. During that period he not only gave the highest proofs of his zeal and fidelity in the discharge of his duty, but in 1721 made a present to that society of 100l.; and so far remitted a very considerable debt, which the corporation owed him, as to accept it in such small sums as were least inconvenient to the state of their affairs. Sir Hans was no less liberal to other learned bodies. He had no sooner purchased the manor of Chelsea, than he gave the company of apothecaries the entire freehold of their botanical garden there, upon condition only that they should present yearly to the Royal Society fifty new plants, till the number should amount to 2000 (A). He gave besides several other considerable donations for the improvement of this garden; the situation of which, on the banks of the Thames, and in the neighbourhood of the capital, was such as to render it useful in two respects: First, by producing the most rare medicinal plants; and, secondly, by serving as an excellent school for young botanists; an advantage which he himself had derived from it in the early part of his life.\n\nThe death of Sir Isaac Newton, which happened in 1727, made way for the advancement of Sir Hans to the presidency of the Royal Society. He had been vice-president, and frequently sat in the chair for that great man; and by his long connection with this learned body he had contracted a strong affection for it, that he made them a present of an hundred guineas, caused a curious bust of King Charles II. its founder, to be erected in the great hall where it met, and, as is said, was very instrumental in procuring Sir Godfrey Copley's benefaction of a medal of the value of five guineas, to be annually given as an honorary mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> to the person who communicates the best experiments to the Society.\n\nOn his being raised to the chair, Sir Hans laid aside all thoughts of further promotion, and applied himself wholly to the faithful discharge of the duties of the offices which he enjoyed. In this laudable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> he employed his time from 1727 to 1742, when, at the age of fourscore, he formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of quitting the service of the public, and of living for himself. With this view he resigned the presidency of the Royal Society much against the inclination of that respectable body, who chose Martin Folkes, Esq., to succeed him, and in a public assembly thanked him for the great and eminent services he had rendered them. In the month of January 1741, he began to remove his library, and his cabinet of rarities, from his house in Bloomsbury to that at Chelsea; and on the 12th of March following, having settled all his affairs, he retired thither himself, to enjoy in peaceful tranquillity the remains of a well-spent life. He did not, however, bury himself in that solitude which excludes men from society. He received at Chelsea, as he had done in London, the visits of people of distinction, of all learned foreigners, and of the royal family, who sometimes did him the honour to wait on him; but, what was still more to his praise, he never refused admittance or advice to rich or poor who came to consult him concerning their health. Not contented with this contracted method of doing good, he now, during his retreat, presented to the public such useful remedies as success had warranted, during the course of a long continued practice. Among these is the efficacious receipt for distempers in the eyes, and his remedy for the bite of a mad dog.\n\nDuring the whole course of his life, Sir Hans had lived with so much temperance, as had preferred him from feeling the infirmities of old age; but in his 90th year he began to complain of pains, and to be sensible of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> decay. He was often heard to say, that the approach of death brought no terrors along with it; that he had long expected the stroke; and that he was prepared to receive it whenever the great Author of his being should think fit. After a short illness of three days, he died on the 11th of January 1752, and was interred on the 18th at Chelsea, in the same vault with his lady, the solemnity being attended with the greatest concourse of people, of all ranks and conditions, that had ever been seen before on the like occasion.\n\nSir Hans being extremely solicitous left his cabinet of curiosities, which he had taken so much pains to collect, should be again diffused at his death, and being at the same time unwilling that so large a portion of his fortune should be lost to his children, he bequeathed it to the public, on condition that 20,000l. should be made good by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> to his family. This sum, though large in appearance, was scarcely more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value of the gold and silver medals, the ores and precious stones that were found in it; for in his last will he declares, that the first cost of the whole amounted at least to 50,000l. Besides his library, consisting\n\n---\n\n(A) This garden was first established by the company in 1673; and having after that period been stocked by them with a great variety of plants, for the improvement of botany, Sir Hans, in order to encourage so serviceable an undertaking, granted to the company the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of it, being part of his estate and manor of Chelsea, on condition that it should be for ever preserved as a physic garden. As a proof of its being so maintained, he obliged the company, in consideration of the said grant, to present yearly to the Royal Society, in one of their weekly meetings, fifty specimens of plants that had grown in the garden the preceding year, and which were all to be specifically distinct from each other, until the number of two thousand should be completed. This number was completed in the year 1761. In 1733 the company erected a marble statue of Sir Hans, executed by Ryibrac, which is placed upon a pedestal in the centre of the garden, with a Latin inscription, expressing his donation, and the design and advantages of it.","sp":7,"ep":9},{"h":"SLOANE","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the class of polyandria, and order of monogynia; and in the natural system ranging under the 50th order, Amentaceae.

One day he was seen (to the distress of his family) on the top of his father's barn, fixing up something like a windmill; another time, he attended some men fixing a pump at a neighbouring village, and observing them cut off a piece of bored pipe, he was so lucky as to procure it, and he actually made with it a working pump that raised water. These anecdotes refer to circumstances that happened while he was in petticoats, and most likely before he attained his fifth year.\n\nAbout his 14th and 15th year, he made for himself an engine for turning, and made several presents to his friends of boxes in ivory or wood very neatly turned. He forged his iron and steel, and melted his metal; he had tools of every sort for working in wood, ivory, and metals. He made a lathe, by which he cut a perpetual screw in brass, a thing little known at that day, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Mr Henry Hindley of York; with whom Mr Smeaton soon became acquainted, and they spent many a night at Mr Hindley's house till day-light, conversing on those subjects.\n\nThus had Mr Smeaton, by the strength of his genius and indefatigable industry, acquired, at the age of 18, an extensive set of tools, and the art of working in most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> trades, without the assistance of any master. A part of every day was generally occupied in forming some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> piece of mechanism.\n\nMr Smeaton's father was an attorney, and desirous of bringing him up to the same profession; Mr Smeaton therefore came up to London in 1742, and attended the courts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> hall; but finding (as his common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> was) that the law did not suit the bent of his genius, he wrote a strong memorial to his father on that subject; whose good sense from that moment left Mr Smeaton to pursue the bent of his genius in his own way.\n\nIn 1751 he began a course of experiments to try a Smeaton machine of his invention to measure a ship's way at sea, and also made two voyages in company with Dr Knight to try it, and a compass of his own invention and making, which was made magnetic by Dr Knight's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> magnets: the second voyage was made in the Fortune flood of war, commanded at that time by Captain Alexander Campbell.\n\nIn 1753 he was elected member of the Royal Society; the number of papers published in their Transactions will show the universality of his genius and knowledge. In 1759 he was honoured by an unanimous vote with their gold medal for his paper intitled \"An Experimental Inquiry concerning the Natural Powers of Water and Wind to turn Mills, and other Machines depending on a Circular Motion.\"\n\nThis paper, he says, was the result of experiments made on working models in the years 1752 and 1753, but not communicated to the Society till 1759; before which time he had an opportunity of putting the effect of these experiments into real practice, in a variety of cases, and for various purposes, so as to allure the Society he had found them to answer.\n\nIn December 1755, the Eddystone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">lighthouse</a> was burnt down: Mr Welton, the chief proprietor, and the others, being desirous of rebuilding it in the most substantial manner, inquired of the earl of Macclesfield (then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Royal Society) whom he thought the most proper to rebuild it; his Lordship recommended Mr Smeaton.\n\nMr Smeaton undertook the work, and completed it in the summer of 1759. Of this Mr Smeaton gives an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> in the volume he published in 1791: that edition has been sold some time ago, and a second is now in the press, under the revival of his much esteemed friend Mr Aubert, F.R.S. and governor of the London assurance corporation.\n\nThough Mr Smeaton completed the building of the Eddystone lighthouse in 1759 (a work that does him so much credit) yet it appears he did not soon get into full bufines as a civil engineer; but in 1764, while in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, he offered himself a candidate for one of the receivers of the Derwentwater estate, and on the 31st of December in that year, he was appointed at a full board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> hospital, in a manner highly flattering to himself; when two other persons strongly recommended and powerfully supported were candidates for the employment. In this appointment he was very happy, by the affluence and abilities of his partner Mr Walton one of the receivers, who taking upon himself the management and accounts, left Mr Smeaton leisure and opportunity to exert his abilities on public works, as well as to make many improvements in the mills and in the estates of Greenwich hospital. By the year 1775 he had so much bufines as a civil engineer, that he wished to resign this appointment; and would have done it then, had not his friend the late Mr Stuart the hospital surveyor, and Mr Ibbetson their secretary, prevailed upon him to continue in the office about two years longer.\n\nMr Smeaton having now got into full bufines as a civil engineer, performed many works of general utility. He made the river Calder navigable; a work that required great skill and judgement, owing to the very impetuous floods in that river: he planned and at-\nSmeaton tended the execution of the great canal in Scotland for conveying the trade of the country either to the Atlantic or German ocean; and having brought it to the place originally intended, he declined a handsome yearly salary, in order that he might attend to the multiplicity of his other business.\n\nOn the opening of the great arch at London bridge, the excavation around and under the sterlings was so considerable, that the bridge was thought to be in great danger of falling. He was then in Yorkshire, and was sent for by express, and arrived with the utmost dispatch: \"I think (says Mr Holmes, the author of his life) it was on a Saturday morning, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the bridge was so general that few would pass over or under it. He applied himself immediately to examine it, and to find about the sterlings as minutely as he could; and the committee being called together, adopted his advice, which was to repurchase the stones that had been taken from the middle pier, then lying in Moorfields, and to throw them into the river to guard the sterlings.\" Nothing shows the apprehensions concerning the falling of the bridge more than the alacrity with which this advice was pursued; the stones were repurchased that day, horses, carts, and barges were got ready, and they began the work on Sunday morning. Thus Mr Smeaton, in all human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, saved London bridge from falling, and secured it till more effectual methods could be taken.\n\nThe vast variety of mills which Mr Smeaton constructed, so greatly to the satisfaction and advantage of the owners, will show the great use which he made of his experiments in 1752 and 1753; for he never trifled to theory in any case where he could have an opportunity to investigate it by experiment. He built a steam engine at Authurpe, and made experiments thereon, purposely to ascertain the power of Newcomen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">steam-engine</a>, which he improved and brought to a greater degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, both in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and powers, than it was before.\n\nMr Smeaton during many years of his life was a frequent attendant on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, his opinion being continually called for; and here his strength of judgement and perspicuity of expression had its full display: it was his constant custom, when applied to, to plan or support any measure, to make himself fully acquainted with it, to see its merits before he would engage in it: by this caution, added to the clearness of his description and the integrity of his heart, he seldom failed to obtain for the bill which he supported an act of parliament. No one was heard with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, nor had any one ever more confidence placed in his testimony. In the courts of law he had several compliments paid him from the bench by Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a> and others, for the new light which he threw on difficult subjects.\n\nAbout the year 1785 Mr Smeaton's health began to decline; and he then took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to endeavour to avoid all the business he could, so that he might have leisure to publish an account of his inventions and works, which was certainly the first wish of his heart; for he has often been heard to say, that \"he thought he could not render so much service to his country as by doing that.\" He got only his account of the Eddystone lighthouse completed, and some preparations to his intended Treatise on Mills; for he could not refuse the solicitations of his friends in various works: and Mr Aubert, whom he greatly loved and respected, being chosen chairman of Ramsgate harbour, prevailed upon him to accept the place of engineer to that harbour; and to their joint efforts the public is chiefly indebted for the improvements that have been made there within these few years, which fully appears in a report that Mr Smeaton gave in to the board of trustees in 1791, which they immediately published.\n\nMr Smeaton being at Authurpe, walking in his garden on the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1792, was struck with the palsy, and died the 28th of October. \"In his illness (says Mr Holmes) I had several letters from him, signed with his name, but written and signed by another's pen; the dictation of them showed that the strength of his mind had not left him. In one written the 26th of September, after minutely describing his health and feelings, he says, 'in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the foregoing, I conclude myself nine-tenths dead; and the greatest favour the Almighty can do me (as I think), will be to complete the other part; but as it is likely to be a lingering illness, it is only in His power to say when that is likely to happen.'\"\n\nMr Smeaton had a warmth of expression that might appear to those who did not know him well to border on harshness; but those more intimately acquainted with him, knew it arose from the intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of his mind, which was always in the pursuit of truth, or engaged in investigating difficult subjects. He would sometimes break out hastily, when any thing was said that did not tally with his ideas; and he would not give up any thing he argued for, till his mind was convinced by sound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>.\n\nIn all the social duties of life he was exemplary; he was a most affectionate husband, a good father, a warm, zealous, and sincere friend, always ready to assist those he respected, and often before it was pointed out to him in what way he could serve them. He was a lover and encourager of merit whatever he found it; and many men are in a great measure indebted to his assistance and advice for their present situation. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, he was always entertaining and instructive; and none could spend any time in his company without improvement.\n\nSMELL; this word has in most languages two meanings, signifying either that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of mind of which we are conscious, in consequence of certain impressions made on the nostrils, and conveyed to the brain by the olfactory nerves; or that unknown virtue, or quality in bodies, which is the cause of our sensations of smell.\n\nSMELLING is the act by which we perceive smells, or become sensible of the presence of odorous bodies. The sensations of smell are excited by certain effluvia, which, in the open air, are always rising from the surfaces of most bodies, and striking on the extremities of the olfactory nerves, give them a peculiar sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, which is communicated to the brain. The particles which issue thus from bodies are extremely volatile, and produce sensation by a degree of contact, which, though insensible, is still more efficient than if it were more gross and palpable. It is by a similar species of insensible contact that the eyes and ears are affected by external objects; whilst, in the excitation of the sensations of touch and of taste, an actual and sensible contact of the object with the organ is necessary.\nSmelling. fary. The organs of smelling are the nostrils and olfactory nerves; the minute ramifications of the latter being distributed throughout the whole concavity of the former. For a description of these, see Anatomy.\n\nThe effluvia from odoriferous bodies are constantly floating about in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and must of course be drawn into the nostrils along with the air in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>; \"so that there is,\" as Dr Reid observes, \"a manifest appearance of design in placing the organ of smell in the inside of that canal, through which the air is continually passing in inspiration and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a>.\" It has been affirmed by Boerhaave, that the matter in animals, vegetables, fossils, &c., which chiefly affects the sense of smelling, is that attenuated substance, inherent in their oily parts, called spirits; because, when this is taken away from the most fragrant bodies, what remains has scarcely any smell at all; but this, he says, if poured on the most odoriferous bodies, gives them a fragrance*. We cannot, however, enter at present upon this inquiry.\n\nThe sense of smell has a close alliance with that of taste; and it seems probable from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> in the situation of their organs in all animals, that both are principally intended to guide them in the choice of their food; so that from this close connection, they are better enabled to choose what is good for them, and to reject what would be injurious. This is the opinion of Dr Reid, as it was, in a very early period of the history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, that of Socrates and of Cicero (A). Dr Reid also remarks, that the sense of smell probably serves the same purpose in the natural state of man; but it is not always a sure guide for this purpose. The organs of smell differ, like those of the other senses, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of the animals to which they belong; and we know, that this sense is in man much less acute, than it is in many other animals. We feel, that in the choice of their food, they are guided by the senses of smell and of taste, except when man has brought them into a sort of unnatural state by domestication. And this circumstance renders it probable, that both these senses were intended to serve the same purpose in the natural state of our species, although less calculated for this end than they are in the brutes, on account of the great superiority of their smelling organs. Besides, since it is probable that man, in the natural state, acts more by instinct than when civilized in society, so also it is reasonable to think, that he may possess some of the senses, (this of smell for instance,) in greater acuteness than we do. This indeed, we are assured to be a fact; for we are told, in the Histoire des Antilles, that there are negroes who, by the smell alone, can distinguish the footsteps of a Frenchman from those of a negro.\n\nThe sense of smell is much more obtuse in man than in some of the lower animals. Dogs we know possess a power of smelling, of which we can scarcely form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, and which, it is happy for us we do not possess (B); and birds of prey are said to possess this sense in still greater acuteness. But although this be more perfect, still the sense of smelling in man, who has other means of judging of his food, &c., is such as to fit him for deriving enjoyment from a diversity of scents, particularly those of flowers and perfumes, to which dogs and other animals seem perfectly insensible. It has been said, we are aware, that some animals, the elephant for instance, are capable of this enjoyment (C); but of this fact we cannot help being very doubtful.\n\nThere is a very great sympathy between the organs of smell and of taste; for any defect or disease of one is generally attended with some corresponding defect or disease of the other. There is also a greater similarity between the sensations of both these, than between those of any other two senses; and hence it is, that we can sometimes tell the taste of an object from its smell, and vice versa. Hence also the reason why we apply the same epithets to the names of both these classes of sensations; as a sweet smell or taste, &c.\n\nIt deserves also to be remarked, that both these senses seem subservient to the preservation of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, rather than to any other purpose. They accordingly constitute an object of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> of man, rather than of intellectual or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>. The other three senses, on the contrary, seem rather intended for (as they certainly are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to) our intellectual improvement, and become, of course, a proper object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> in the sciences of moral philosophy, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>.\n\nThe advantages derived by man and the other animals from the sense of smelling are not confined to the assistance which it affords them in the choice of their food. Most bodies in nature, when exposed to the open air, are constantly sending forth emanations or effluvia of such extreme acuteness as to be perfectly invisible. These diffuse themselves through the air, and however noxious or salutary, would not be perceived without the sense of smelling, which if not vitiated by unnatural habits, is not only a faithful monitor when danger is at hand, but conveys to us likewise the most exquisite pleasures.\n\n---\n\n(A) \"Ut gustus (says a learned physiologist) cibi itineri, sic olfactus ostio viarum, quas aer subire debet, custos preponitur, monituras ne quid noxi, via quae semper patet, in corpus admittatur. Porro, ut gustus, sic quoque olfactus ad salutarem cibum invitat, a noxio aut corrupto, putrido imprimis vel rancido, deterret.\"\n\n\"When thou feelst the mouth, through which animals take in whatever they desire, always placed near the nose and eyes, thinkest thou not, says Socrates to Aristodemus, that this is the work of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>?\" Xenophon's Memorables, book i, chap. 4.\n\n(B) \"The excessive eagerness which dogs express on smelling their game, seems to be but little connected with the appetite for food, and wholly independent of any preconceived ideas of the objects of their pursuit being fit for it. Hence several kinds of them will not eat the game which they pursue with such wild impetuosity; and of which the scent seems to animate them to a degree of ecstasy far beyond what the desire of food can produce.\" Knight on Taste.\n\n(C) There is an animal to which, naturalists say, perfume is so agreeable and so necessary, that nature has provided it with a little bag stored with an exquisite odour. \"On pretend, (says Buffon,) que la mangouste ouvre cette poche, pour se refra\u00eechir lorsqu'elle est trop chaud.\"\nSmelling pleasures. The fragrance of a rose, and of many other flowers, is not only pleasant, but gives a refreshing and delightful stimulus to the whole system, whilst the odours proceeding from hemlock, or any noxious vegetable, or other substance, are highly offensive to our nostrils. Hence we are naturally led to seek the one class of sensations, and to avoid the other.\n\nIn some species of animals the sense of smell seems to be connected with certain mental sympathies, as those of hearing and sight are in all that possess them in any high degree: for not only their sexual desires appear to be excited by means of it, but other instinctive passions, which, according to the usual system of nature, should be still more remote from its influence. Dogs, although wholly unacquainted with lions, will shudder at their roar; and an elephant that has never seen a tiger, will in the same manner show the strongest symptoms of horror and affright at the smell of it. \"The late Lord Clive (says an ingenious writer), exhibited a combat between two of these animals at Calcutta; but the scent of the tiger had such an effect upon the elephant, that nothing could either force or allure him to go along the road, where the cage in which the tiger was inclosed, had passed, until a gallon of arack was given him. Upon this, his horror suddenly turning into fury, he broke down the paling to get at his enemy, and killed him without difficulty.\"\n\nIf riding along a road, near which a dead horse, or part of its carcass, happens to be lying, we know, that our horse, although he sees it not, cannot be made to pass the place but with difficulty. Where blood has been shed, particularly that of their own species, oxen will assemble, and upon smelling it, roar and bellow, and show the most manifest signs of horror and distress. And yet these symptoms could not arise from any associated notions of danger or death, since they appear in such as never had any opportunities of acquiring them. They must therefore be instinctive, like other instinctive antipathies and propensities. But although in their mutual intercourse, animals make much use of the sense of smell, still it does not seem to be further concerned in exciting their sexual desires, than in indicating their object.\n\nSome of those spleenetic philosophers, who are ready upon all occasions to quarrel with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of nature, have taken the liberty of condemning their Maker, because it has pleased his unfathomable wisdom to bestow so many influences upon the brute senses and instincts more perfect than he has given to man, without reflecting that he has given to man an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>; for it may be asked with the poet,\n\n\"Is not his reason all these powers in one?\n\"Is Heaven unkind to man and man alone?\n\"Shall he alone, whom rational we call,\n\"Be pleased with nothing if not blest with all.\"\n\nWith respect to that unknown peculiarity of bodies, which is the cause of our sensations of smell, the opinions of philosophers have been very various. Until of late, the doctrine of Descartes and Locke on this subject was pretty generally received; but, since the publication of Doctor Reid's works, his opinion, which we deem the most correct and satisfactory, has become very popular. We will endeavour to abridge his account of this matter. For this purpose, let us suppose a person, who has grown up without the sense of smell, to be immediately endowed with the use of this organ, and placed near some flowers of an exquisite flavour. When he examines what he feels in such a situation, he can find no resemblance between this new sensation and anything with which he is already acquainted. He finds himself unable to explain its nature, and cannot ascribe to it figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, or any known property of matter. It is a simple affection, or feeling, of mind, and, considered abstractedly, can have no necessary connection with the nerves, the nostrils, or effluvia, or with any thing material whatever. By the nature of his constitution he is, however, led to refer this peculiar sensation to the nostrils, as its organ; and when, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and by means of touch, he learns that external objects have the power of exciting this sensation, he concludes, that there must exist in bodies some unknown cause by which it is excited. In the first part of this process he considers the feeling, or sensation, abstractedly. As such it exists in the mind only; and cannot exist there but when the mind is conscious of it. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> soon enables him to distinguish different sorts of smells, all of them very distinct from one another; but, conformably to the nature of all sensation, extremely simple. He concludes, that each of these must have a distinct cause; and finding, by experience, that this cause is an unknown something in bodies, he concludes, that it must be a property of matter, and, for want of another, gives it the name of smell. When he removes an odoriferous body from the organ, the sensation vanishes; when the body is again applied, the sensation is excited: and hence it is, that he is led naturally to connect the sensation with this unknown peculiarity of bodies by which it is produced. But since we see, that the sensation is, in a great degree, related to other objects besides its unknown cause, to the mind in which it exists, for instance, and to the organ which is its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, it may be asked why it becomes associated in the mind with its cause only? The reason seems pretty obvious. No single sensation or class of sensations, is more connected with the mind, than any others of which it is susceptible. Nor is the connection subsisting between the organ and any of the sensations peculiar to it greater than that which subsists between it and every other sensation of which it is the inlet. Hence the connection between the smell of an orange and the mind, or between it and the nostrils, is very general, and cannot, in the former instance, distinguish it from any other sensation of whatever kind, nor, in the latter from any other particular smell. But the connexion between this sensation and the orange is peculiar and permanent; and we accordingly find them always associated in the mind, just as we associate the notion of fire with the sensation of burning. The relation which a sensation of smell, or any sensation, bears to the mind, to an organ, or to the memory and conception of itself, is common to all sensations. The relation which any sensation bears to its own cause, supposing the sensation of smell to a particular virtue or quality of bodies, is common to it with every other sensation, when considered with respect to its peculiar cause. And finally, a sensation of any kind bears the same sort of relation to the memory and conception of itself, that any other feeling or operation of mind bears to the conception and memory of that particular feeling or operation.\n\nWhatever then be the nature of the minute particles\nSmelling of bodies by which our sensations of smell are excited, we cannot help conferring their unknown cause as a virtue or quality of matter. Like all other modifications of material substance, it must be confessed, that this can have no resemblance to the sensations of mind. But we are not, therefore, to conclude with the followers of Descartes and Locke, that this secondary quality is a mere sensation; especially as we can readily conceive it existing where it is not smelled, or even after supposing the annihilation of every sentient being throughout the universe. The existence of the sensation we know to be momentary and fugitive; but in the existence of its cause we can, without difficulty, or inconveniency, conceive a permanency independent of mind and of its sensations.\n\nThe doctrine we have been illustrating has of late been called into question by a sceptical writer, who, it appears to us, has upon this occasion been entirely deficient in his accustomed acuteness. Dr Reid's account of this affair seems so full, so clear and convincing, that we are at a loss to conceive how his meaning can be misinterpreted; and yet the arguments and objections of the writer to whom we allude, derive all their plausibility from a misinterpretation of Dr Reid's meaning, and from a deviation from the established use of language. \"An eminent metaphysician\" (says this author) has declared that he has not the least difficulty in conceiving the air perfumed with aromatic odours in the deserts of Arabia; and he has decided, that the man who maintains smells to exist only in the mind, must be mad, or must abuse language and disgrace philosophy. There are some authors, nevertheless, who differ widely on this subject from the learned metaphysician. Is it possible for a sensation to exist where there is no sentient? The authors to whom I allude think it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>.\" And so, we may tell this learned author, does Dr Reid, if he will take his word for it. Of the sensation of smell he remarks: \"It is indeed impossible, that it can be in any body: it is a sensation; and a sensation can be in a sentient thing only.\" Again, \"I can think of the smell of a rose when I do not smell it; and it is possible that when I think of it there is no rose there existing; but, when I smell it, I am necessarily determined to believe that the sensation really exists. This is common to all sensations, that, as they cannot exist but in being perceived, so they cannot be perceived but they must exist.\" But, continues this acute metaphysician, \"a smell is nothing else than a sensation. It is a feeling, which may be agreeable or disagreeable; which may, as some think, be excited by various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of elements; but which, since it is a feeling, cannot be those elements which are said to cause it, and cannot exist where there is no creature to perceive it. What is to be understood, in philosophical strictness, by the perfumes of the desert? We can excuse the poet when he makes the ocean smile, the winds dance, and the flowers respire; or even were he to perfume the desert. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> is no such magician, and had better not wander through the regions of fancy in search of sensations where there is no sentient.\" And is it then true that the word smell means only a sensation? A sensation is no more than an effect; it is a transient modification of the mind, which the mind itself can never produce. It must then have some cause which is external to the mind. Now, it is to this cause, and not to the sensation, that the name smell is most frequently applied in all languages; and it is this cause which Dr Reid supposes capable of existing in the deserts of Arabia, where there is no sentient being to perceive it. But let us hear himself: \"We have considered smell as signifying a sensation, feeling, or impression upon the mind; and in this sense it can only be in a mind or sentient being; but it is evident that mankind give the name of smell much more frequently to something which they conceive to be external, and to be a quality of body; they understand by it something which does not at all infer a mind, and have not the least difficulty in conceiving the air perfumed with aromatic odours in the deserts of Arabia, or in some uninhabited island where the human foot never trod.\" The faculty of smelling is something very different from the actual sensation of smell. For the faculty may remain when we have no sensation. And the mind is no less different from the faculty, for it continues the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> being when that faculty is lost. What is smell in the rose? It is a quality or virtue of the rose, or of something proceeding from it, which we perceive by the sense of smelling; and this is all we know of the matter. But what is smelling? It is an act of the mind, but is never imagined to be a quality of the mind. Again, the sensation of smelling is conceived to infer necessarily a mind or sentient being; but smell in the rose infers no such thing. We say, this body smells sweet and that stinks; but we do not say, this mind smells sweet and that stinks; therefore, smell in the rose, and the sensation which it causes, are not conceived, even by the vulgar, to be things of the same kind, although they have the same name.\"\n\nThere are some other remarks on Dr Reid's opinion in the work upon which we have been commenting, which we shall pass by; we may, however, notice the author's concluding argument: after mentioning some examples, he observes, \"Now in these instances we see men and animals that must have perception of smell, if I may be permitted to say so, altogether different from each other. Is not smell sensation when the spaniel finds sport in the field for his master; when the shark pursues through the ocean its expected victim; and when the camel conducts the thirsty wanderer to a fountain of fresh water across the burning sands of the Arabian desert?\" If no animal had the sensation of smell, there would be no odour; for aroma and oils may be thought to be material compositions, but are neither agreeable nor disagreeable feelings.\" If men and animals differ in their perceptions of smell, (and no doubt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of organization will cause them to do so,) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> should not be, we think, that smell is merely sensation, but that there is actually something external which is the cause of their sensations, and about which they differ. A rose put to the nostrils of a man and then to those of a dog, may excite very different sensations; but we cannot think that the peculiarity of the rose, which excites these different sensations, varies by thus changing the position of the rose. If at table one person mistakes nutmeg for beef, and another thinks that it is venison, the conclusion may be, that it is neither venison nor beef; but no man in his senses can conclude that there is no meat at the table. But, \"is not smell sensation when the spaniel finds sport for his master in the field?\" There is sensation no doubt; but we may be permitted to ask, what would become of the spaniel's sensation of smell and of his master's sport, were there no game in\nSmelling the field? What of the shark's sensation of smell and purfuit, were there no victim in the ocean? and what of the camel and the thirsty wanderer, were there no fountain of fresh water in the Arabian deserts? \"The smell of a rose signifies two things,\" says Dr Reid; \"First, A sensation which can have no existence but when it is perceived, and can only be in a sentient being or mind.\n\nSecondly, It signifies some power, quality, or virtue in the rose, or in effluvia proceeding from it, which hath a permanent existence independent of the mind; and which, by the constitution of nature, produces the sensation in us. By the original constitution of our nature we are both led to believe that there is a permanent cause of the sensation, and prompted to seek after it; and experience determines us to place it in the rose. The names of all smells, tastes, sounds, as well as heat and cold, have a like ambiguity in all languages; but it deserves our attention, that these names are but rarely, in common language, used to signify the sensations; for the most part, they signify the external qualities which are indicated by the sensations.\" We have been induced thus to discuss this topic at some length, because we regretted to see Dr Reid's opinion and reasoning misrepresented; and we shall now conclude, not as this modern Berkeleyan does, \"that, if no animal had the sensation of smell, there would be no odour;\" but, that if there were no odour or external cause of smell, no animal would have this sensation.\n\nThe sense of smell becomes sometimes too acute, either in consequence of some defect or disuse of the organ, or from too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of the whole nervous system, such as we sometimes observe in fevers, in phrenitis, and in hysterical diseases. It is however more frequently blunted in consequence of affections of the brain and nerves, arising from blows on the head, or from internal causes; or this may happen on account of too great a dryness of the organ, owing to a suppression of the accustomed humours, or to their being conveyed off by some other channel; or it may arise from too great a quantity of tears and of mucus choking up the nostrils. We have instances of both in cases of common cold, in which, at the beginning of the disease, the nostrils are dry, but as it advances, begin to discharge a great deal of humour, or become obstructed by a thick mucus. Whatever hinders the free entrance of the air into the nostrils or its passage through them, must also injure the sense of smell. It is also sometimes depraved as to perceive smells when there is no odoriferous body present, or to perceive smells different from those that are really present. Some of the particles of the odoriferous effluvia, after having remained for some time in the caverns of the nostrils, issuing forth again and affecting the organ, will sometimes cause this species of false perception, even in the most healthy persons.\n\nThe sense of smelling may be diminished or destroyed by diseases; as by the moisture, dryness, inflammation, or suppuration of the olfactory membrane, the compression of the nerves which supply it, or some fault in the brain itself at their origin. A defect, or too great a degree of solidity of the small spongy bones of the upper jaw, the caverns of the forehead, &c. may likewise impair this sense; and it may be also injured by a collection of fetid matter in these caverns, which is continually exhaling from them, and also by immoderate use of snuff. When the nose abounds with moisture, after gentle evacuations, such things as tend to take off irritation and coagulate the thin sharp serum may be applied; as the oil of anise mixed with fine flour, camphor dissolved in oil of almonds, &c., the vapours of amber, frankincense, gum-mastic, and benjamin, may likewise be received into the nose and mouth. For moistening the mucus when it is too dry, some recommend snuff made of the leaves of marjoram, mixed with oil of amber, marjoram, and aniseed; or a tincture of calcined white vitriol, twelve grains of which may be mixed with two ounces of marjoram water and filtrated. The steam of vinegar upon hot iron, and received up the nostrils, is also of use for softening the mucus, removing obstructions, &c. If there be an ulcer in the nose, it ought to be dressed with some emollient ointment, to which, if the pain be very great, a little laudanum may be added. If it be a venereal ulcer, 12 grains of corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a> may be dissolved in a pint and a half of brandy, a table spoonful of which may be taken twice a day. The ulcer ought likewise to be washed with it, and the fumes of cinnamon may be received up the nostrils.\n\nIf there be reason to suspect that the nerves which supply the organs of smelling are inert, or want stimulating, volatile salts, or strong snuffs, and other things which occasion sneezing, may be applied to the nose; the forehead may likewise be anointed with balsam of Peru, to which may be added a little oil of amber.\n\nSMELT.

At 14 he was sent to Queen's college <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, where he distinguished himself so much, that he was made Henry VIII.'s scholar together with John Cheke. He was chosen a fellow of his college in 1531, and appointed two years after to read the public Greek lecture. The common mode of reading Greek at that time was very faulty; the same found being given to the letters and diphthongs, \u03b9, \u03b7, \u03c5, \u03b5\u03b9, \u03bf\u03b9, \u03c9. Mr Smith and Mr Cheke had been for some time sensible that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> was wrong; and after a good deal of consultation and research, they agreed to introduce that mode of reading which prevails at present. Mr Smith was lecturing on Arisotle de Republica in Greek. At first he dropped a word or two at intervals in the new pronunciation, and sometimes he would stop as if he had committed a mistake and correct himself. No notice was taken of this for two or three days; but as he repeated more frequently, his audience began to wonder at the unusual sounds, and at last some of his friends mentioned to him what they had remarked. He owned that something was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, but that it was not yet sufficiently digested to be made public. They entreated him earnestly to discover his project: he did so; and in a short time great numbers resorted to him for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. The new pronunciation was\nwas adopted with enthusiasm, and soon became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> at Cambridge. It was afterwards opposed by Bishop Gardiner the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>; but its superiority to the old mode was so visible, that in a few years it spread over all England.\n\nIn 1539 he travelled into foreign countries, and studied for some time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of France and Italy. On his return he was made regius professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a> at Cambridge. About this time he published a treatise on the mode of pronouncing English. He was useful likewise in promoting the reformation. Having gone into the family of the duke of Somerset, the protector during the minority of Edward VI, he was employed by that nobleman in public affairs; and in 1548 was made secretary of state, and received the honour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>. While that nobleman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in office, he was sent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, first to Brussels and afterwards to France.\n\nUpon Mary's accession he lost all his places, but was fortunate enough to preserve the friendship of Gardiner and Bonner. He was exempted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, and was allowed, probably by their influence, a pension of \u00a3100. During <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>'s reign he was employed in public affairs, and was sent three times by that princess as her ambassador to France. He died in 1577. His abilities were excellent, and his attainments uncommonly great: He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, a physician, a chemist, mathematician, linguist, historian, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>. He wrote, 1. A treatise called the English Commonwealth. 2. A letter De Repta et Emendata Lingua Graecae Pronunciatione. 3. De Moribus Turcarum. 4. De Druidum Moribus.\n\nSmith, Edmund, an English poet, the only son of Mr Neale an eminent merchant, by a daughter of Baron Lechmere, was born in 1668. By his father's death he was left young to the care of Mr Smith, who had married his father's sister, and who treated him with so much tenderness, that at the death of his generous guardian he assumed his name. His writings are not many, and those are scattered about in miscellanies and collections: his celebrated tragedy of Phaedra and Hippolitus was acted in 1707; and being introduced at a time when the Italian opera so much engrossed the polite world, gave Mr Addison, who wrote the prologue, an opportunity to rally the vitiated taste of the public. However, notwithstanding the esteem it has always been held in, it is perhaps rather to be considered as a fine poem than as a good play. This tragedy, with a Poem to the memory of Mr John Philips, three or four Odes, with a Latin oration spoken at Oxford in laudem Thomae Bodleii, were published as his works by his friend Mr Oldifworth. Mr Smith died in 1710, sunk into indolence and intemperance by poverty and disappointments; the hard fate of many a man of genius.\n\nSmith, John, an excellent mezzotinter, flourished about 1700; but neither the time of his birth nor death is accurately known. He united strength with fineness, and finished with freedom. He served his time with one Tillet a painter in Moorfields; and as soon as he became his own master, learned from Becket the secret of mezzotinto, and being farther instructed by Van der Vaart, was taken to work in Sir Godfrey Kneller's house; and as he was to be the publisher of that master's works, doubtless received considerable hints from him, which he amply repaid. \"To posterity perhaps his prints (says Mr Walpole) will carry an idea of something <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a>; perukes of an enormous length flowing over suits of armour, compose wonderful habits. It is equally strange that fashion could introduce the vers, one, and establish the practice of representing the other when it was out of fashion.\" Smith excelled in exhibiting both, as he found them in the portraits of Kneller, who was less happy in what he substituted to armour. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-KIT_CAT_CLUB\">Kit-cat club</a> he has poured full bottoms chiefly over night gowns. If those streams of hair were incommode in a battle, I know nothing (he adds) they were adapted to that can be done in a night-gown. Smith composed two large volumes, with proofs of his own plates, for which he asked \u00a350. His finest works are Duke Schomberg on horseback; that duke's son and successor Morhard; the earls of Pembroke, Dorset, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>; three plates with two figures in each, of young persons or children, in which he shows; William Cowper; Gibbons and his wife; Queen Anne; the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>, a whole length, with a flowerpot; a very curious one of Queen Mary, in a high head, fan, and gloves; the earl of Godolphin; the duchess of Ormond, a whole length, with a black; Sir George Rooke, &c. There is a print by him of James II. with an anchor, but no inscription; which not being finished when the king went away, is so scarce that it is sometimes sold for above a guinea. Smith also performed many historic pieces; as the loves of the gods, from Titian, at Blenheim, in ten plates; Venus standing in a shell, from a picture by Corregio, and many more, of which perhaps the most delicate is the holy family with angels, after Carlo Maratti.\"\n\nSmith, Dr Adam, the celebrated author of the Philosophical Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, was the only son of Adam Smith comptroller of the customs at Kirkaldy, and of Margaret Douglas, daughter of Mr Douglas of Stratherny. He was born at Kirkaldy on the 5th June 1723, a few months after vol iii. the death of his father. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> during his infancy was infirm and sickly, and required all the care of his surviving parent. When only three years old he was carried by his mother to Stratherny on a visit to his uncle Mr Douglas; and happening one day to be amusing himself alone at the door of the house, he was stolen by a party of those vagrants who in Scotland are called tinkers. Luckily he was missed immediately, and the vagrants pursued and overtaken in Leslie wood; and thus Dr Smith was preserved to extend the bounds of science, and reform the commercial policy of Europe.\n\nHe received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in the school of Kirkaldy under David Miller, a teacher of considerable eminence, and whose name deserves to be recorded on account of the great number of eminent men which that seminary produced while under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. Dr Smith, even while at school, attracted notice by his passionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to books, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> powers of his memory; while his friendly and generous disposition gained and secured the affection of his schoolfellows. Even then he was remarkable for those habits which remained with him through life, of speaking to himself when alone and of absence in company. He was sent in 1737 to the university of Glasgow, where he remained till 1740, when he went\nto Balliol college Oxford, as an exhibitioner on Snell's foundation. His favourite pursuits while at the university were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a>. After his removal to England he frequently employed himself in translating, particularly from the French, with a view to the improvement of his own style: a practice which he often recommended to all who wished to cultivate the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. It was probably then also that he applied himself with the greatest care to the study of languages, of which, both ancient and modern, his knowledge was uncommonly extensive and accurate.\n\nAfter seven years residence at Oxford he returned to Kirkaldy, and lived two years with his mother without any fixed plan for his future life. He had been designed for the church of England; but disliking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> profession, he resolved to abandon it altogether, and to limit his ambition to the prospect of obtaining some of those preferments to which literary attainments lead in Scotland. In 1748 he fixed his residence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and for three years read a course of lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres under the patronage of Lord Kames. In 1751 he was elected professor of logic in the university of Glasgow, and the year following was removed to the professorship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>, vacant by the death of Mr Thomas Craigie, the immediate successor of Dr Hutcheon. In this situation he remained 13 years, a period he used frequently to look back to as the most useful part of his life. His lectures on moral philosophy were divided into four parts: The first contained natural theology; in which he considered the proofs of the being and attributes of God, and those truths on which religion is founded: the second comprehended ethics, strictly so called, and consisted chiefly of those doctrines which he afterwards published in his theory of moral sentiments: in the third part he treated more at length of that part of morality called justice; and which, being susceptible of precise and accurate rules, is for that reason capable of a full and accurate explanation: in the last part of his lectures he examined those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> regulations which are founded, not upon the principle of justice, but of expediency; and which are calculated to increase the riches, the power, and the prosperity of a state. Under this view he considered the political institutions relating to commerce, to finances, to ecclesiastical and military governments: this contained the substance of his Wealth of Nations. In delivering his lectures he trifled almost entirely to extemporary elocution: his manner was plain and unaffected, and he never failed to interest his hearers. His reputation soon rose very high, and many students found their way merely upon his account.\n\nWhen his acquaintance with Mr Hume first commenced is uncertain; but it had ripened into friendship before the year 1752.\n\nIn 1759 he published his Theory of Moral Sentiments; a work which deservedly extended his reputation: for, though several of its conclusions be ill-founded, it must be allowed by all to be a singular effort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, ingenuity, and subtlety. Besides, it contains a great mixture of important truth; and, though the author has sometimes been misled, he has had the merit of directing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of philosophers to a view of human nature, which had formerly in a great measure escaped their notice. It abounds everywhere with the purest and most elevated maxims concerning the practical conduct of life; and when the subject of his work leads him to address the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> and the heart, the variety and felicity of his illustrations, the richness and fluency of his eloquence, and the skill with which he wins the attention and commands the passions of his readers, leave him among our British moralists without a rival.\n\nTowards the end of 1763 Dr Smith received an invitation from Mr Charles Townend to accompany the duke of Buccleugh on his travels; and the liberal terms in which this proposal was made induced him to resign his office at Glasgow. He joined the duke of Buccleugh at London early in the year 1764, and set out with him for the continent in the month of March following. After a stay of about ten days at Paris, they proceeded to Thoulouse, where they fixed their residence for about 18 months; thence they went by a pretty extensive route through the south of France to Geneva, where they passed two months. About Christmas 1765 they returned to Paris, and remained there till October following. The society in which Dr Smith passed these ten months may be conceived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the recommendation of Mr Hume. Turgot, Quinai, Necker, d'Alembert, Helvetius, Montesquieu, Madame Riccoboni, were among the number of his acquaintances; and some of them he continued ever after to reckon among the number of his friends. In October 1766 the duke of Buccleugh returned to England.\n\nDr Smith spent the next ten years of his life with his mother at Kirkaldy, occupied habitually in intense study, but unbending his mind at times in the company of some of his old schoolfellows, who still continued to reside near the place of their birth. In 1776 he published his Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations; a book so universally known, that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> on it would be useless. The variety, importance, and (may we not add) novelty, of the information which it contains; the skill and comprehensiveness of mind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in the arrangement; the admirable illustrations with which it abounds; together with a plainness and perspicuity which makes it intelligible to all\u2014render it unquestionably the most perfect work which has yet appeared on the general principles of any branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>.\n\nHe spent the next two years of his life in London, where he enjoyed the society of some of the most eminent men of the age: but he removed to Edinburgh in 1778, in consequence of having been appointed, at the request of the duke of Buccleugh, one of the commissioners of the customs in Scotland. Here he spent the last twelve years of his life in an affluence which was more than equal to all his wants. But his studies seemed entirely suspended till the infirmities of old age reminded him, when it was too late, of what he yet owed to the public and to his own fame. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> materials of the works which he had announced had long ago been collected, and little probably was wanting but a few years of health and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> to complete them. The death of his mother, who had accompanied him to Edinburgh in 1781, together with that of his cousin Miss Douglas in 1788, contributed to frustrate these projects. They had been the objects of his affection for\nfor more than 60 years, and in their society he had enjoyed from his infancy all that he ever knew of the endearments of a family. He was now alone and helpless; and though he bore his loss with equanimity, and regained apparently his former cheerfulness, yet his health and strength gradually declined till the period of his death, which happened in July 1790. Some days before his death he ordered all his papers to be burnt except a few essays, which have since been published.\n\nOf the originality and comprehensiveness of his views; the extent, the variety, and the correctness of his information; the inexhaustible fertility of his invention\u2014he has left behind him lasting monuments. To his private worth, the most certain of all testimonies may be found in that confidence, respect, and attachment, which followed him through all the various relations of life. He was habitually absent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, and was apt when he spoke to deliver his ideas in the form of a lecture. He was rarely known to start a new topic himself, or to appear unprepared upon those topics that were introduced by others. In his external form and appearance there was nothing uncommon. When perfectly at ease, and when warmed with conversation, his gestures were animated and not ungraceful; and in the society of those he loved, his features were often brightened by a smile of ineffable benignity. In the company of strangers, his tendency to silence, and perhaps still more his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of that tendency, rendered his manners somewhat embarrassed; an effect which was probably not a little heightened by those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> ideas of propriety which his recluse habits tended at once to perfect in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, and to diminish his power of realizing.","sp":16,"ep":19},{"h":"SMITHERY","t":"a smith's shop; also the art of a smith, by which iron is wrought into any shape by means of fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMMERING\">hammering</a>, filing, &c.","sp":19,"ep":19},{"h":"SMITHIA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the daphne class; and in the natural method ranking under the 3rd order, Papilionaceae.

As this vapour is extremely disagreeable to the senses, and often prejudicial to the health, mankind have fallen upon several contrivances to enjoy the benefit of fire, without being annoyed by smoke. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> of these contrivances is a tube leading from the chamber in which the fire is kindled to the top of the building, through which the smoke ascends, and is dispersed into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. These tubes are called chimneys; which, when constructed in a proper manner, carry off the smoke entirely; but, when improperly constructed, they carry off the smoke imperfectly, to the great annoyance of the inhabitants. As our mansions at present seem to have a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> knowledge of the manner in which chimneys ought to be built, we can hardly perform a more acceptable service to the public than to point out the manner in which they ought to be constructed, so as to carry off the smoke entirely; as well as to explain the causes from which the defects so often complained of generally proceed, and the method of removing them.\n\nThose who would be acquainted with this subject should begin by considering on what principle smoke ascends in any chimney. At first many are apt to think that smoke is in its nature, and of itself, lighter than air, and rises in it for the same reason that cork rises in water. There is no cause why smoke should not rise in the chimney though the room be ever so close. Others think there is a power in chimneys to draw up the smoke, and that there are different forms of chimneys which afford more or less of this power. They amuse themselves with searching for the best form. The equal dimensions of a funnel in its whole length is not thought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> enough, and it is made, for fancied reasons, sometimes tapering and narrowing from below upwards, and sometimes the contrary, &c., &c. A simple experiment or two may serve to give more correct ideas. Having lighted a pipe of tobacco, plunge the stem to the bottom of a decanter half filled with cold water; then putting a rag over the bowl, blow through it, and make the smoke descend in the stem of the pipe, from the end of which it will rise in bubbles through the water; and being thus cooled, will not afterwards rise to go out through the neck of the decanter, but remain spreading itself and resting on the surface of the water. This shows that smoke is really heavier than air, and that it is carried upwards only when attached to or acted upon by air that is heated, and thereby rarified and rendered specifically lighter than the air in its neighbourhood.\n\nSmoke being rarely seen but in company with heated air, and its upward motion being visible, though that of the rarified air that drives it is not so, has naturally given rise to the error. It is now well known that air is a fluid which has weight as well as others, though about 800 times lighter than water; that heat makes the particles of air recede from each other, and take up more space, so that the same weight of air heated will have more bulk than equal weights of cold air which may surround it, and in that case must rise, being forced upwards by such colder and heavier air, which presses to get under it and take its place. That air is rarified or expanded by heat, may be proved to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> by a flask blown bladder, which laid before a fire, will soon swell, grow tight, and burst.\n\nAnother experiment may be to take a glass tube about an inch in diameter, and 12 inches long, open at both ends, and fixed upright on legs so that it need not be handled, for the hands might warm it. At the end of a quill fallen five or six inches of the finest light filament of silk, so that it may be held either above the upper end of the tube or under the lower end, your warm hand being at a distance by the length of the quill. If there were any motion of air through the tube, it would manifest itself by its effect on the silk; but if the tube and the air in it are of the same temperature with the surrounding air, there will be no such motion, whatever may be the form of the tube, whether crooked or straight, narrow below and widening up-\nwards, or the contrary, the air in it will be quiescent. Warm the tube, and you will find as long as it continues warm, a constant current of air entering below and passing up through it till discharged at the top; because the warmth of the tube being communicated to the air it contains, rarefies that air, and makes it lighter than the air without; which therefore presses in below, forces it upwards, follows and takes its place, and is rarefied in its turn. And, without warming the tube, if you hold under it a knob of hot iron, the air thereby heated will rise and fill the tube, going out at its top; and this motion in the tube will continue as long as the knob remains hot, because the air entering the tube below, is heated and rarefied by passing near and over that knob.\n\nThat this motion is produced merely by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of specific gravity between the fluid within and that without the tube, and not by any fancied form of the tube itself, may appear by plunging it into water contained in a glass jar a foot deep, through which such motion might be seen. The water within and without the tube being of the same specific gravity, balance each other, and both remain at rest. But take out the tube, stop its bottom with a finger, and fill it with olive oil, which is lighter than water; then stopping the top, place it as before, its lower end under water, its top a very little above. As long as you keep the bottom flopped the fluids remain at rest; but the moment it is unlopped, the heavier enters below, forces up the lighter, and takes its place; and the motion then ceases, merely because the new fluid cannot be successively made lighter, as air may be by a warm tube.\n\nIn fact, no form of the funnel of a chimney has any share in its operation or effect respecting smoke except its height. The longer the funnel, if erect, the greater its force when filled with heated and rarefied air to draw in below and drive up the smoke, if one may, in compliance with custom, use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> draw, when in fact it is the superior weight of the surrounding atmosphere that presses to enter the funnel below, and so drives up before it the smoke and warm air it meets with in its passage.\n\nWhat is it then which makes a smoky chimney, that is, a chimney which, instead of conveying up all the smoke, discharges a part of it into the room, offending the eyes and damaging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>?\n\nThe causes of this effect may be reduced to nine, differing from each other, and therefore requiring different remedies.\n\n1. Smoky chimneys in a new house are such frequently from mere want of air. The workmanship of the rooms being all good, and just out of the workman's hands, the joints of the boards of the flooring, and of the panels of wainscoting, are all true and tight; the more so as the walls, perhaps not yet thoroughly dry, preserve a dampness in the air of the room which keeps the woodwork swelled and close. The doors and the sashes too, being worked with truth, shut with exactness, so that the room is as tight as a snuff-box, no passage being left open for air to enter except the key-hole, and even that is sometimes covered by a little dropping shutter. Now if smoke cannot rise but as connected with rarefied air, and a column of such air, suppose it filling the funnel, cannot rise unless other air be admitted to supply its place; and if therefore no current of air enter the opening of the chimney\u2014there is nothing to prevent the smoke from coming out into the room. If the motion upwards of the air in a chimney that is freely supplied be observed by the rising of the smoke or a feather in it, and it be considered that in the time such feather takes in rising from the fire to the top of the chimney, a column of air equal to the content of the funnel must be discharged, and an equal quantity supplied from the room below, it will appear absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> that this operation should go on if the tight room is kept shut; for were there any force capable of drawing constantly so much air out of it, it must soon be exhausted like the receiver of an air-pump, and no animal could live in it. Those therefore who stop every crevice in a room to prevent the admission of fresh air, and yet would have their chimney carry up the smoke, require inconsistencies, and expect impossibilities. Yet under this situation it is not uncommon to see the owner of a new house in despair, and ready to sell it for much less than it cost; conceiving it uninhabitable because not a chimney in any one of its rooms will carry off the smoke unless a door or window be left open. Much expense has also been made to alter and amend new chimneys which had really no fault: in one house particularly which Dr Franklin knew that belonged to a nobleman in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, that expense amounted to no less than \u00a3300. After his house had been, as he thought, finished and all charges paid. And after all, several of the alterations were ineffectual, for want of understanding the true principles.\n\nRemedies. When you find on trial that opening the door or a window enables the chimney to carry up all the smoke, you may be sure that want of air from without was the cause of its smoking, \"I say from without\" (adds Dr Franklin), to guard you against a common mistake of those who may tell you the room is large, contains abundance of air sufficient to supply any chimney, and therefore it cannot be that the chimney wants air. These reasoners are ignorant that the largeness of a room, if tight, is in this case of small importance, since it cannot part with a chimneyful of its air without occasioning so much vacuum; which it requires a great force to effect, and could not be borne if effected.\"\n\nIt appearing plainly then, that some of the outward air must be admitted, the question will be, how much is absolutely necessary? for you would avoid admitting more, as being contrary to one of your intentions in having a fire, viz. that of warming your room. To discover this quantity, shut the door gradually while a middling fire is burning, till you find that before it is quite shut the smoke begins to come out into the room; then open it a little till you perceive the smoke comes out no longer. There hold the door, and observe the width of the open crevice between the edge of the door and the rabbet it should shut into. Suppose the distance to be half an inch, and the door eight feet high; you find thence that your room requires an entrance for air equal in area to 96 half inches, or 48 square inches, or a passage of 6 inches by 8. This, however, is a large supposition; there being few chimneys that, having a moderate opening and a tolerable height of funnel, will not be satisfied with such a crevice of a quarter of an inch: Dr Franklin found a square of 6 by 6, or 36 square inches, to be pretty good medium that\nthat will serve for most chimneys. High funnels with small and low openings may indeed be supplied through a less space; because, for reasons that will appear hereafter, the force of levity, if one may so speak, being greater in such funnels, the cool air enters the room with greater velocity, and consequently more enters in the same time. This, however, has its limits; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> shows, that no increased velocity so occasioned has made the admission of air through the key-hole equal in quantity to that through an open door, though through the door the current moves slowly, and through the key-hole with great rapidity.\n\nIt remains then to be considered, how and where this necessary quantity of air from without is to be admitted so as to be least inconvenient: for if at the door, left too much open, the air thence proceeds directly to the chimney, and in its way comes cold to your back and heels as you sit before your fire. If you keep the door shut, and raise a little the sash of your window, you feel the same inconvenience. Various have been the contrivances to avoid this; such as bringing in fresh air through pipes in the jams of the chimney, which painting upwards should blow the smoke up the funnel; opening passages into the funnel above, to let in air for the same purpose. But these produce an effect contrary to that intended: for as it is the constant current of air passing from the room through the opening of the chimney into the funnel which prevents the smoke from coming out into the room, if you supply the funnel by other means or in other ways with the air which it wants, and especially if that air be cold, you diminish the force of that current, and the smoke in its efforts to enter the room finds less resistance.\n\nThe wanted air must then indispensably be admitted into the room, to supply what goes off through the opening of the chimney. M. Gauger, a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and intelligent French writer on the subject, proposes with judgment to admit it above the opening of the chimney; and to prevent inconvenience from its coldness, he directs that it may be so made, that it shall pass in its entrance through winding cavities made behind the iron back and sides of the fire-place, and under the iron hearth-plate; in which cavities it will be warmed, and even heated, so as to contribute much, instead of cooling, to the warming of the room. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> is excellent in itself, and may be used with advantage in building new houses; because the chimneys may then be disposed so as to admit conveniently the cold air to enter such passages: but in houses built without such views, the chimneys are often so situated as not to afford that convenience without great and expensive alterations. Easy and cheap methods, though not quite so perfect in themselves, are of more general utility; and such are the following.\n\nIn all rooms where there is a fire, the body of air warmed and rarefied before the chimney is continually changing place, and making room for other air that is to be warmed in its turn. Part of it enters and goes up the chimney, and the rest rises and takes place near the ceiling. If the room be lofty, that warm air remains above our heads as long as it continues warm, and we are little benefited by it, because it does not descend till it is cooler. Few can imagine the difference of climate between the upper and lower parts of such a room, who have not tried it by the thermometer, or by going up a ladder till their heads are near the ceiling.\n\nIt is then among this warm air that the wanted quantity of outward air is best admitted, with which being mixed, its coldness is abated, and its inconvenience diminished so as to become scarcely observable. This may be easily done by drawing down about an inch the upper sash of a window; or, if not moveable, by cutting such a crevice through its frame; in both which cases it will be well to place a thin shelf of the length to conceal the opening, and sloping upwards, to direct the entering air horizontally along and under the ceiling. In some houses the air may be admitted by such a crevice made in the wainscot, cornice, or plastering, near the ceiling and over the opening of the chimney. This, if practicable, is to be chosen, because the entering cold air will there meet with the warmest rising air from before the fire, and be soonest tempered by the mixture. The same kind of shelf should also be placed here. Another way, and not a very difficult one, is to take out an upper pane of glass in one of your sashes, fit it in a tin frame, giving it two springing angular sides, and then replacing it, with hinges below on which it may be turned to open more or less above. It will then have the appearance of an internal sky-light. By drawing this pane in, more or less, you may admit what air you find necessary. Its position will naturally throw that air up and along the ceiling. This is what is called in France a Was \u00fcbt das? As this is a German question, the invention is probably of that nation, and takes its name from the frequent asking of that question when it first appeared. In England some have of late years cut a round hole about five inches diameter in a pane of the sash and placed against it a circular plate of tin hung on an axis, and cut into vanes; which, being separately bent a little obliquely, are acted upon by the entering air, so as to force the plate continually round like the vanes of a windmill. This admits the outward air, and by the continual whirling of the vanes, does in some degree disperse it. The noise only is a little inconvenient.\n\n2. A second case of the smoking of chimneys is, their openings in the room being too large; that is, too wide, too high, or both. Architects in general have no other ideas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> in the opening of a chimney than what relate to symmetry and beauty reflecting the dimensions of the room; while its true proportion respecting its function and utility depends on quite other principles; and they might as properly proportion the step in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAIRCASE\">staircase</a> to the height of the story, instead of the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of men's legs in mounting. The proportion then to be regarded, is what relates to the height of the funnel. For as the funnels in the different stories of a house are necessarily of different heights or lengths, that from the lowest floor being the highest or longest, and those of the other floors shorter and shorter, till we come to those in the garrets, which are of course the shortest; and the force of draft being, as already said, in proportion to the height of funnel filled with rarefied air, and a current of air from the room into the chimney, sufficient to fill the opening, being necessary to oppose and prevent the smoke from coming out into the room; it follows, that the openings of the longest funnels may be larger, and that those of the shorter funnels should be smaller. For if there be a large opening to a chimney that does not draw strongly, the funnel may\nSmoke may happen to be furnished with the air which it demands by a partial current entering on one side of the opening, and leaving the other side free of any opposing current, may permit the smoke to issue there into the room. Much too of the force of draft in a funnel depends on the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> in the air it contains, and that depends on the nearness to the fire of its passage in entering the funnel. If it can enter far from the fire on each side, or far above the fire, in a wide or high opening, it receives little heat in passing by the fire, and the contents of the funnel are by those means less different in levity from the surrounding atmosphere, and its force in drawing consequently weaker. Hence if too large an opening be given to chimneys in upper rooms, those rooms will be smoky: On the other hand, if too small openings be given to chimneys in the lower rooms, the entering air operating too directly and violently on the fire, and afterwards strengthening the draft as it ascends the funnel, will consume the fuel too rapidly.\n\nRemedy. As different circumstances frequently mix themselves in these matters, it is difficult to give precise dimensions for the openings of all chimneys. Our fathers made them generally much too large; we have lessened them; but they are often still of greater dimensions than they should be, the human eye not being easily reconciled to sudden and great changes. If you suspect that your chimney smokes from the too great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> of its opening, contract it by placing moveable boards so as to lower and narrow it gradually till you find the smoke no longer issues into the room. The proportion so found will be that which is proper for that chimney, and you may employ the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-BRICKLAYER\">bricklayer</a> or mason to reduce it accordingly. However, as in building new houses something must be sometimes hazarded, Dr Franklin proposes to make the openings in the lower rooms about 30 inches square and 18 deep, and those in the upper only 18 inches square and not quite so deep; the intermediate ones diminishing in proportion as the height of the funnel is diminished. In the larger openings, billets of two feet long, or half the common length of cordwood, may be burnt conveniently; and for the smaller, such wood may be sawed into thirds. Where coals are the fuel, the grates will be proportioned to the openings. The same depth is nearly necessary to all, the funnels being all made of a size proper to admit a chimney-sweeper. If in large and elegant rooms custom or fancy should require the appearance of a larger chimney, it may be formed of expensive marginal decorations, in marble, &c. But in time perhaps, that which is fittest in the nature of things may come to be thought handsome.\n\n3. Another cause of smoky chimneys is too short a funnel. This happens necessarily in some cases, as where a chimney is required in a low building; for, if the funnel be raised high above the roof, in order to strengthen its draft, it is then in danger of being blown down, and crushing the roof in its fall.\n\nRemedy. Contract the opening of the chimney, so as to oblige all the entering air to pass through or very near the fire; whereby it will be more heated and rarefied, the funnel itself be more warmed, and its contents have more of what may be called the force of levity, so as to rise strongly and maintain a good draft at the opening.\n\nOr you may in some cases, to advantage, build additional stories over the low building, which will support a high funnel.\n\nIf the low building be used as a kitchen, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the opening therefore inconvenient, a large one being necessary, at least when there are great dinners, for the free management of so many cooking utensils; in such case the best expedient perhaps would be to build two more funnels joining to the first, and having three moderate openings, one to each funnel, instead of one large one. When there is occasion to use but one, the other two may be kept shut by sliding plates, hereafter to be described; and two or all of them may be used together when wanted. This will indeed be an expense, but not an useless one, since your cooks will work with more comfort, see better than in a smoky kitchen what they are about, your viands will be cleaner dressed and not taste of smoke, as is often the case; and to render the effect more certain, a stack of three funnels may be safely built higher above the roof than a single funnel.\n\nThe case of too short a funnel is more general than would be imagined, and often found where one would not expect it. For it is not uncommon, in ill-contrived buildings, instead of having a funnel for each room or fire-place, to bend and turn the funnel of an upper room so as to make it enter the side of another funnel that comes from below. By these means the upper room funnel is made short of course, since its length can only be reckoned from the place where it enters the lower room funnel; and that funnel is also shortened by all the distance between the entrance of the second funnel and the top of the flack: for all that part being readily supplied with air through the second funnel, adds no strength to the draft, especially as that air is cold when there is no fire in the second chimney. The only easy remedy here is, to keep the opening of that funnel shut in which there is no fire.\n\n4. Another very common cause of the smoking of chimneys is, their overpowering one another. For instance, if there be two chimneys in one large room, and you make fires in both of them, the doors and windows close shut, you will find that the greater and stronger fire shall overpower the weaker, from the funnel of which it will draw air down to supply its own demand; which air descending in the weaker funnel, will drive down its smoke, and force it into the room. If, instead of being in one room, the two chimneys are in two different rooms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> by a door, the case is the same whenever that door is open. In a very tight house, a kitchen chimney on the lowest floor, when it had a great fire in it, has been known to overpower any other chimney in the house, and draw air and smoke into its room as often as the door communicating with the stair-case was opened.\n\nRemedy. Take care that every room have the means of supplying itself from without with the air which its chimney may require, so that no one of them may be obliged to borrow from another, nor under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of lending. A variety of these means have been already described.\n\n5. Another cause of smoking is, when the tops of chimneys are commanded by higher buildings, or by a hill, so that the wind blowing over such eminences falls like water over a dam, sometimes almost perpendicularly on the\nSmoke, the tops of the chimneys that lie in its way, and beats down the smoke contained in them.\n\nTo illustrate this, let A (fig. 3.) represent a small building at the side of a great rock B, and the wind coming in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> CD; when the current of air comes to the point D, being hurried forward with great velocity, it goes a little forward, but soon descends downward, and gradually is reflected more and more inward, as represented by the dotted lines EE, &c., so that, descending downwards upon the top of the chimney A, the smoke is beat back again into the apartments.\n\nIt is evident that houses situated near high hills or thick woods will be in some measure exposed to the same inconvenience; but it is likewise plain, that if a house be situated upon the slope of a hill (as at F, fig. 3.), it will not be in any danger of smoke when the wind blows towards that side of the hill upon which it is situated; for the current of air coming over the house-top in the direction GH, is immediately changed by the slope of the hill to the direction HC, which powerfully draws the smoke upward from the top of the chimney. But it is also evident, that a house in this situation will be liable to smoke when the wind blows from the hill; for the current of air coming downward in the direction CH, will beat downward on the chimney F, and prevent the smoke from ascending with freedom. The effect will be much heightened if the doors and windows are chiefly in the lowermost side of the house.\n\nRemedy. That commonly applied to this case is a turncap made of tin or plate iron, covering the chimney above and on three sides, open on one side, turning on a spindle; and which being guided or governed by a vane always prevents its back to the current. This may be generally effectual, though not certain, as there may be cases in which it will not succeed. Raising your funnels if practicable, so as their tops may be higher, or at least equal, with the commanding eminence, is more to be depended on. But the turning cap, being easier and cheaper, should first be tried. \"If obliged to build in such a situation, I would choose (says Dr Franklin) to place my doors on the side next the hill, and the backs of my chimneys on the farthest side; for then the column of air falling over the eminence, and of course prefling on that below, and forcing it to enter the doors or wind-ducts on that side, would tend to balance the pressure down the chimneys, and leave the funnels more free in the exercise of their functions.\"\n\n6. There is another case which is the reverse of that last mentioned. It is where the commanding eminence is farther from the wind than the chimney commanded. To explain this a figure may be necessary. Suppose then a building whose side AB happens to be exposed to the wind, and forms a kind of dam against its progress. Suppose the wind blowing in the direction FE. The air obstructed by this dam or building AB will like water press and leach for passages through it; but finding none, it is beat back with violence, and spreads itself on every side, as is represented by the curved lines e, e, e, e, e, e. It will therefore force itself down the small chimney C, in order to get through by some door or window open on the other side of the building. And if there be a fire in such chimney, its smoke is of course beat down, and fills the room.\n\nRemedy. There is but one remedy, which is to raise such a funnel higher than the roof, supporting it if necessary by iron bars. For a turncap in this case has no effect, the dammed-up air prefling down through it in whatever position the wind may have placed its opening.\n\nDr Franklin mentions a city in which many houses are rendered smoky by this operation. For their kitchens being built behind, and connected by a passage with the houses, and the tops of the kitchen-chimneys lower than the tops of the houses, the whole side of a street when the wind blows against its back forms such a dam as above described; and the wind so obstructed forces down those kitchen-chimneys (especially when they have but weak fires in them) to pass through the passage and house into the street. Kitchen-chimneys so formed and situated have another inconvenience. In summer, if you open your upper rooms windows for air, a light breeze blowing over your kitchen-chimney towards the house, though not strong enough to force down its smoke as aforesaid, is sufficient to waft it into your windows, and fill the rooms with it; which, besides the disagreeableness, damages your furniture.\n\n7. Chimneys, otherwise drawing well, are sometimes made to smoke by the improper and inconvenient situation of a door. When the door and chimney are on the same side of the room, if the door being in the corner is made to open against the wall, which is common, as being there, when open, more out of the way, it follows, that when the door is only opened in part, a current of air rushing in passes along the wall into and across the opening of the chimney, and flirts some of the smoke out into the room. This happens more certainly when the door is fluttering, for then the force of the current is augmented, and becomes very inconvenient to those who, warming themselves by the fire, happen to fit in its way.\n\nThe remedies are obvious and easy. Either put an intervening screen from the wall round great part of the fireplace; or, which is perhaps preferable, shift the hinges of your door, so as it may open the other way, and when open throw the air along the other wall.\n\n8. A room that has no fire in its chimney is sometimes filled with smoke which is received at the top of its funnel, and descends into the room. Funnels without fires have an effect according to their degree of coldness or warmth on the air that happens to be contained in them. The surrounding atmosphere is frequently changing its temperature; but stacks of funnels covered from winds and sun by the house that contains them, retain a more equal temperature. If, after a warm season, the outward air suddenly grows cold, the empty warm funnels begin to draw strongly upward; that is, they rarefy the air contained in them, which of course rises, cooler air enters below to supply its place, is rarified in its turn, and rises; and this operation continues till the funnel grows cooler, or the outward air warmer, or both, when the motion ceases. On the other hand, if after a cold season the outward air suddenly grows warm and of course lighter, the air contained in the cool funnels being heavier descends into the room; and the warmer air which enters their tops being cooled in its turn, and made heavier, continues to descend; and this operation goes on till the funnels are warmed by the passing of warm air through them, or the air itself grows cooler.\nWhen the temperature of the air and of the funnels is nearly equal, the difference of warmth in the air between day and night is sufficient to produce these currents; the air will begin to ascend the funnels as the cool of the evening comes on, and this current will continue till perhaps nine or ten o'clock the next morning, when it begins to hesitate; and as the heat of the day approaches, it sets downwards, and continues so till towards evening, when it again hesitates for some time, and then goes upwards constantly during the night, as before mentioned. Now when smoke rising from the tops of neighbouring funnels passes over the tops of funnels which are at the time drawing downwards, as they often are in the middle part of the day, such smoke is necessarily drawn into these funnels, and descends with the air into the chamber.\n\nThe remedy is to have a sliding plate that will shut perfectly the offending funnel. Dr Franklin has thus described it: \"The opening of the chimney is contracted by brick-work faced with marble slabs to about two feet between the jams, and the breast brought down to within about three feet of the hearth. An iron frame is placed just under the breast, and extending quite to the back of the chimney, so that a plate of the same metal may slide horizontally backwards and forwards in the grooves on each side of the frame. This plate is just so large as to fill the whole space, and shut the chimney entirely when thrust quite in, which is convenient when there is no fire. Draw it out, so as to leave between its further edge and the back a space of about two inches; this space is sufficient for the smoke to pass; and so large a part of the funnel being stopped by the rest of the plate, the passage of warm air out of the room, up the chimney, is obstructed and retarded; and by these means much cold air is prevented from coming in through crevices, to supply its place. This effect is made manifest three ways. 1. When the fire burns briskly in cold weather, the howling or whistling noise made by the wind, as it enters the room through the crevices, when the chimney is open as usual, ceases as soon as the plate is slid into its proper distance. 2. Opening the door of the room about half an inch, and holding your hand against the opening, near the top of the door, you feel the cold air coming in against your hand, but weakly, if the plate be in. Let another person suddenly draw it out, so as to let the air of the room go up the chimney, with its usual freedom where chimneys are open, and you immediately feel the cold air rushing in strongly. 3. If something be set against the door, just sufficient, when the plate is in, to keep the door nearly shut, by resisting the pressure of the air that would force it open: then, when the plate is drawn out, the door will be forced open by the increased pressure of the outward cold air endeavouring to get in to supply the place of the warm air that now passes out of the room to go up the chimney. In our common open chimneys, half the fuel is wasted, and its effect lost; the air it has warmed being immediately drawn off.\"\n\nChimneys which generally draw well, do nevertheless sometimes give smoke into the rooms, it being driven down by strong winds passing over the tops of their funnels, though not descending from any commanding eminence. This case is most frequent where the funnel is short and the opening turned from the wind. It is the more grievous, when it happens to be a cold wind that produces the effect, because when you most want your fire you are sometimes obliged to extinguish it. To understand this, it may be considered that the rising light air, to obtain a free issue from the funnel, must push out of its way or oblige the air that is over it to rise. In a time of calm or of little wind this is done visibly; for we see the smoke that is brought up by that air rise in a column above the chimney: but when a violent current of air, that is, a strong wind, passes over the top of a chimney, its particles have received so much force, which keeps them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> direction and follow each other so rapidly, that the rising light air has not strength sufficient to oblige them to quit that direction and move upwards to permit its issue.\n\nRemedies. In Venice, the custom is to open or widen the top of the flue, rounding it in the true form of a funnel. In other places the contrary is practised; the tops of the flues being narrowed inwards, so as to form a slit for the issue of the smoke, long as the breadth of the funnel, and only four inches wide. This seems to have been contrived on a supposition that the entry of the wind would thereby be obstructed and perhaps it might have been imagined, that the whole force of the rising warm air being condensed, as it were, in the narrow opening, would thereby be strengthened, so as to overcome the resistance of wind. This, however, did not always succeed; for when the wind was at north-east and blew fresh, the smoke was forced down by fits into the room where Dr Franklin commonly sat, so as to oblige him to shift the fire into another. The position of the slit of this funnel was indeed north-east and south-west. Perhaps if it had lain across the wind, the effect might have been different. But on this we can give no certainty. It seems a matter proper to be referred to experiment; possibly a turncap might have been serviceable, but it was not tried.\n\nWith all the science, however, that a man shall suppose himself possessed of in this article, he may sometimes meet with cases that shall puzzle him. \"I once lodged (says Dr Franklin) in a house at London, which in a little room had a single chimney and funnel. The opening was very small, yet it did not keep in the smoke, and all attempts to have a fire in this room were fruitless. I could not imagine the reason, till at length observing that the chamber over it, which had no fireplace in it, was always filled with smoke when a fire was kindled below, and that the smoke came through the cracks and crevices of the wainscot; I had the wainscot taken down, and discovered that the funnel which went up behind it had a crack many feet in length, and wide enough to admit my arm; a breach very dangerous with regard to fire, and occasioned probably by an apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> settling of one side of the house. The air entering this breach freely, destroyed the drawing force of the funnel. The remedy would have been, filling up the breach, or rather rebuilding the funnel: but the landlord rather chose to stop up the chimney.\n\nAnother puzzling case I met with at a friend's country house near London. His best room had a chimney in which, he told me, he never could have a fire, for all the smoke came out into the room. I flattered myself I could easily find the cause and prefer the cure. I opened the door, and perceived it was not want of air. I made a temporary contraction of the opening of the chimney, and found that it was not its being\nbeing too large that caused the smoke to issue. I went out and looked up at the top of the chimney: Its funnel was joined in the same stack with others; some of them shorter, that drew very well, and I saw nothing to prevent its doing the same. In fine, after every other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> I could think of, I was obliged to own the insufficiency of my skill. But my friend, who made no pretension to such kind of knowledge, afterwards discovered the cause himself. He got to the top of the funnel by a ladder, and looking down found it filled with twigs and straw cemented by earth and lined with feathers. It seems the house after being built, had stood empty some years before he occupied it; and he concluded that some large birds had taken the advantage of its retired situation to make their nest there. The rubbish, considerable in quantity, being removed, and the funnel cleared, the chimney drew well, and gave satisfaction.\n\nChimneys whose funnels go up in the north wall of a house, and are exposed to the north winds, are not so apt to draw well as those in a south wall; because when rendered cold by those winds, they draw downwards.\n\nChimneys inclosed in the body of a house are better than those whose funnels are exposed in cold walls.\n\nChimneys in stacks are apt to draw better than separate funnels, because the funnels that have constant fires in them warm the others in some degree that have none.\n\n**SMOKE-Jack.** This ingenious machine is of German origin, and Messinger, in his *Collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Performances*, says it is very ancient, being represented in a painting at Nurenbergh, which is known to be older than the year 1350.\n\nIts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> is abundantly simple. An upright iron spindle GA (fig. 5.), placed in the narrow part of the kitchen chimney, turns round on two points H and I. The upper one H passes through an iron bar, which is built in across the chimney; and the lower pivot I is of tempered steel, and is conical or pointed, resting in a conical bell-metal socket fixed on another crofs bar. On the upper end of the spindle is a circular fly G, consisting of 4, 6, 8, or more thin iron plates, set obliquely on the spindle like the sails of a windmill, as we shall describe more particularly by and by. Near the lower end of the spindle is a pinion A, which works in the teeth of a contrate or face wheel B, turning on a horizontal axis BC. One pivot of this axis turns in a cock fixed on the crofs bar, which supports the lower end of the upright spindle HI, and the other pivot turns in a cock fixed on the side wall of the chimney; so that this axle is parallel to the front of the chimney. On the remote end of this horizontal axle there is a small pulley C, having a deep angular groove. Over this pulley there passes a chain CDE, in the lower bight of which hangs the large pulley E of the spit. This end of the spit turns loosely between the branches of the fork of the rack or raze F, but without resting on it. This is on the top of a moveable stand, which can be shifted nearer to or farther from the fire. The other end turns in one of the notches of another rack. The number of teeth in the pinion A and wheel B, and the diameters of the pulleys C and E, are so proportioned that the fly G makes from 12 to 20 turns for one turn of the spit.\n\nThe manner of operation of this useful machine is easily understood. The air which contributes to the burning of the fuel, and passes through the midst of it, is greatly heated, and expanding prodigiously in bulk, becomes lighter than the neighbouring air, and is therefore pushed by it up the chimney. In like manner, all the air which comes near the fire is heated, expanded, becomes lighter, and is driven up the chimney. This is called the *draught* or *suction*, but would with greater propriety be termed the *drift* of the chimney. As the chimney gradually contracts in its dimensions, and as the same quantity of heated air passes through every section of it, it is plain that the rapidity of its ascent must be greatest in the narrowest place. There the fly G should be placed, because it will there be exposed to the strongest current. The air, striking the fly vanes obliquely, pushes them aside, and thus turns them round with a considerable force. If the joint of meat is exactly balanced on the spit, it is plain that the only resistance to the motion of the fly is what arises from the friction of the pivots of the upright spindle, the friction of the pinion and wheel, the friction of the pivots of the horizontal axis, the friction of the small end of the spit, and the friction of the chain in the top pulleys. The whole of this is but a mere trifle. But there is frequently a considerable inequality in the weight of the meat on different sides of the spit; there must therefore be a sufficient overplus of force in the impulse of the ascending air on the vanes of the fly, to overcome this want of equilibrium occasioned by the unskillfulness or negligence of the cook. There is, however, commonly enough of power when the machine is properly constructed. The utility of this machine will, we hope, procure us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of some of our readers, while we point out the circumstances on which its performance depends, and the maxims which should be followed in its construction.\n\nThe upward current of air is the moving power, and should be increased as much as possible, and applied in the most advantageous manner. Every thing will increase the current which improves the draught of the chimney, and secures it from smoking. A smoky chimney must always have a weak current. For this particular, therefore, we refer to what has been delivered in the article *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>*, No. 359; and the article *Smoke*.\n\nWith respect to the manner of applying this force, it is evident that the best construction of a windmill sails will be nearly the best construction for the fly. According to the usual theory of the impulse of fluids, the greatest effective impulse (that is, in the direction of the fly's motion) will be produced if the plane of the vane be inclined to the axis in an angle of 54 degrees 46 minutes. But, since we have pronounced this theory to be so very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>, we had better take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> founded on the experiments on the impulse of fluids made by the academy of Paris. These authorise us to say, that 49\u00b0 or 50\u00b0 degrees will be the best angle to give the vane; but this must be understood only of that part of it which is close adjoining to the axis. The vane itself must be twisted, or *weathered* as the millwrights term it, and must be much more oblique at its outer extremity. The exact position cannot be determined with any precision; because this depends on the proportion...\nproportion of the velocity of the vane to that of the current of heated air. This is subject to no rule, being changed according to the load of the jack. We imagine that an obliquity of 65 degrees for the outer ends of the vanes will be a good position for the generality of cases. Meffinger describes an ingenious contrivance for changing this angle at pleasure, in order to vary the velocity of the motion. Each vane is made to turn round a midrib, which stands out like a radius from the spindle, and the vane is moved by a stiff wire attached to one of the corners adjoining to the axle. These wires are attached to a ring which slides on the spindle like the spreader of an umbrella; and it is stopped on any part of the spindle by a pin thrust through a hole in the spindle and ring. We mention this briefly, it being easily understood by any mechanic, and but of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, because the machine is not susceptible of much precision.\n\nIt is easy to see that an increase of the surface of the vanes will increase the power; therefore they should occupy the whole space of the circle, and not consist of four narrow arms like the sails of a windmill. It is better to make many narrow vanes than a few broad ones; as will appear plain to one well acquainted with the mode of impulse of fluids acting obliquely. We recommend eight or twelve at least; and each vane should be so broad, that when the whole is held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> between the eye and the light, no light shall come through the fly, the vanes overlapping each other a very small matter. We also recommend the making them of stiff plate. Their weight contributes to the steady motion, and enables the fly, which has acquired a considerable velocity during a favourable position of things, to retain a momentum sufficient to pull round the spit while the heavy side of the meat is rising from its lowest position. In such a situation a light fly soon loses its momentum, and the jack staggers under its load.\n\nIt is plain, from what has been said, that the fly should occupy the whole of that section of the vent where it is placed. The vent must therefore be brought to a round form in that place, that none of the current may pass uselessly by it.\n\nIt is an important question where the fly should be placed. If in a wide part of the vent, it will have a great surface, and act by a long lever; but the current in that place is slow, and its impulse weak. This is a fit subject of calculation. Suppose that we have it in our choice to place it either as it is drawn in the figure, or farther up at g, where its diameter must be one half of what it is at G. Since the same quantity of heated air passes through both sections, and the section g has only one-fourth of the area of the section G, it is plain that the air must be moving four times faster, and that its impulse is 16 times greater. But the surface on which it is acting is the fourth part of that of the fly G; the actual impulse therefore is only four times greater, supposing both flies to be moving with the same relative velocity in respect of the current; that is, the rim of each moving with the same portion of the velocity of the current. This will be the case when the small fly turns eight times as often in a minute as the large fly; for the air is moving four times as quick at g, and the diameter of g is one-half of that of G. Therefore, when the small fly is turning eight times as quick as the great one, there is a quadruple impulse acting at half the distance from the axis. The momentum or energy therefore of the current is double. Therefore, supposing the pinion, wheel, and pulleys of both jacks to be the same, the jack with the small fly, placed in the narrow part of the vent, will be 16 times more powerful.\n\nBy this example, more easily understood than a general process, it appears that it is of particular importance to place the fly in an elevated part of the vent, where the area may be much contracted. In order still farther to increase the power of the machine, it would be very proper to lengthen the spindle still more, and to put another fly on it at a considerable distance above the first, and a third above this, &c.\n\nAs the velocity of the current changes by every change of the fire, the motion of this jack must be very unsteady. To render it as adjustable as may be to the particular purpose of the cook, the pulley E has several grooves of different diameters, and the spit turns more or less slowly, by the same motion of the fly, according as it hangs in the chain by a larger or smaller pulley or groove.\n\nSuch is the construction of the smoke-jack in its most simple form. Some are more artificial and complicated, having, in place of the pulleys and connecting chain, a spindle coming down from the horizontal axis BC. On the upper end of this spindle is a horizontal contrate wheel, driven by a pinion in place of the pulley C. On the lower end is a pinion, driving a contrate wheel in place of the pulley E. This construction is represented in fig. 6. Others are constructed more simply, in Fig. 7, the manner represented in fig. 7. But our first con-\n\nFig. 7\n\nstruction has great advantage in point of simplicity, and allows a more easy adjustment of the spit, which may be brought nearer to the fire or removed farther from it without any trouble; whereas, in the others, with a train of wheels and pinions, this cannot be done without several changes of pins and screws. The only imperfection of the pulley is, that by long use the grooves become flippery, and an ill-balanced joint is apt to hold back the spit, while the chain slides in the grooves. This may be completely prevented by making the grooves flat instead of angular (which greatly diminishes the friction), and furnishing them with short studs or pins which take into every third or fourth link of the chain. If the chain be made of the simplest form, with flat links, and each link be made of an exact length (making them all on a mould), the motion will be as easy as with any wheelwork, and without the least chance of slipping.\n\nIt is always of importance to avoid this slipping of the chain by balancing the loaded spit. For this purpose it will be extremely convenient to have what is called a balance-skewer. Let a part of the spit, immediately adjoining to the pulley, be made round, and let an arm be made to turn on it stiffly, so that it may be made fast in any position by a screw. Let a leaden ball be made to slide along this arm, with a screw to fasten it at any distance from the spit. When the meat is spitted, lay it on the racks, and the heaviest side will immediately place itself undermost. Now turn round the balance-skewer, so that it may point straight upwards, and make it fast in that position by the screw. Put the leaden ball on it, and slide it inwards or out-\nwards till it exactly balances the heavy side, which will appear by the spit's remaining in any position in which it is put.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is to keep the machine in repair. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part of it, the first mover, the fly, and the pinion and wheel, by which its motion is transmitted to the rest of the machine, are situated in a place of difficult access, and where they are exposed to violent heat and to the smoke and soot. The whole weight of the fly, resting on the lower pivot I, must exert a great pressure there, and occasion great friction, even when this pinion is reduced to the smallest size that is compatible with the necessary strength. The pivot must be of hardened steel, tapered like an obtuse cone, and must turn in a conical socket, also of hardened steel or of bell-metal; and this seat of pressure and friction must be continually supplied with oil, which it consumes very quickly. It is not sufficient that it be from time to time smeared with an oiled feather; there must be an iron cup formed round the socket, and kept filled with oil. It is surprising how quickly it disappears; it soon becomes clammy by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, and by the foot which gathers about it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> rubbing of the pivot and socket wears them both very fast; and this is increased by hard powders, such as sandy dust, that are hurled up by the rapid current every time that the cook fires the fire. These, getting between the rubbing parts, cause them to grind and wear each other prodigiously. It is a great improvement to invert these rubbing parts. Let the lower end of the spindle be of a considerable thickness, and have a conical hollow nicely drilled in its extremity. Let a blunt-pointed conical pin rise up in the middle of the oil cup, on which the conical hollow of the spindle may rest. Here will be the same steady support, and the same friction as in the other way; but no grinding dust can now lodge between the pivot and its socket; and if this upright pin be screwed up through the bottom of the cup, it may be screwed farther up in proportion as it wears; and thus the upper pivot g will never defect its hole, a thing which soon happens in the common way. We can say from experience, that a jack constructed in this way will not require the fifth part of the repairs of one done in the other way.\n\nIt is of importance that the whole be so put together as to be easily taken down, in order to sweep the vent, or to be repaired, &c. For this purpose, let the cross bar which carries the lower end of the upright spindle be placed a little on one side of the perpendicular line from the upper pivot hole. Let the cock which carries the oil-cup and the pivot of the horizontal axis BC be screwed to one side of this cross bar, so that the centre of the cup may be exactly under the upper pivot hole. By this construction we have only to uncrew this cock, and then both axles come out of their places at once, and may be replaced without any trouble. We have sketched in fig. 8. the manner in which this may be done, where M represents a section of the lower cross bar. BCDE is the cock, fixed to the bar by the pins which go through both, with finger nuts a and b on the opposite side. Fi is the hard steel pin with the conical top i, on which the lower end I of the upright spindle AG rests, in the manner recommended as the best and most durable. The pivot of the horizontal axis turns in a hole, at E the top of the cock.\n\nAfter all, we must acknowledge that the smoke-jack is inferior to the common jack that is moved by a weight. It is more expensive at first, and requires more frequent repairs; its motion is not so much under command; it occasions too much to be thrown about the fire, to the great annoyance of the cook; and it is a great encumbrance when we would clean the vent.\n\nSMOKE-Farthings.

The first piece we know of with certainty is a satire in two parts, printed first in the years 1746 and 1747, and reprinted in a collection of his Plays and Poems in 1777. About this period, or some time before, he wrote for Mr Rich an opera intitled Alceste, which has never been performed nor printed.\nAt the age of 18 he wrote a tragedy intitled The Regicide, founded on the story of the assination of James I. of Scotland. In the preface to this piece, published by subscription in the year 1749, he bitterly exclaimed against false patrons, and the duplicity of theatrical managers. The warmth and impetuosity of his temper hurried him, on this occasion, into unjust reflections against the late George Lord Lyttleton and Mr Garrick: the character of the former he characterized in the novel of Peregrine Pickle, and he added a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> of the Monody written by that nobleman on the death of his lady. Against Mr Garrick he made illiberal ill-founded criticisms; and in his novel of Roderic Random gave a very unfair representation of his treatment of him respecting this tragedy. Of this conduct he afterwards repented, and acknowledged his errors; though in the subsequent editions of the novel the passages which were the hasty effusions of disappointment were not omitted.\n\nHowever, in giving a sketch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERAL_ARTS\">liberal arts</a> in his History of England, he afterwards remarked, \"the exhibitions of the stage were improved to the most exquisite entertainment by the talents and management of Garrick, who greatly surpassed all his predecessors of this and perhaps every other nation, in his genius for acting, in the sweetness and variety of his tones, the irresistible magic of his eye, the fire and vivacity of his action, the eloquence of attitude, and the whole-pathos of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>.\n\nNot satisfied with this public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, he wrote an apology to Mr Garrick in still stronger terms. With these ample concessions, Mr Garrick was completely satisfied; so that in 1757, when Dr Smollet's comedy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRISALS\">Reprisals</a>, an afterpiece of two acts, was performed at Drury Lane theatre, the latter acknowledged himself highly obliged for the friendly care of Mr Garrick exerted in preparing it for the stage: and still more for his acting the part of Lufignan in Zara for his benefit, on the fifth instead of the ninth night, to which he was only intitled by the custom of the theatre.\n\nThe Adventures of Roderic Random, published in 1748, 2 vols 12mo, a book which still continues to have a most extensive sale, first established the Doctor's reputation. All the first volume and the beginning of the second appear to consist of real incident and character, though certainly a good deal heightened and disguised. The Judge his grandfather, Crab and Potion the two apothecaries, and 'Squire Gawky, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> well known in that part of the kingdom where the scene was laid. Captains Oakhum and Whiffle, Doctors Macklane and Morgan, were also said to be real personages; but their names we have either never learned or have now forgotten. A bookbinder and barber long eagerly contended for being shadowed under the name of Strap. The Doctor seems to have enjoyed a peculiar felicity in describing sea characters, particularly the officers and sailors of the navy. His Trunnion, Hatchway, and Pipes, are highly finished originals; but what exceeds them all, and perhaps equals any character that has yet been painted by the happiest genius of ancient or modern times, is his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Bowling. This is indeed nature itself; original, unique, and sui generis.\n\nBy the publication of this work the Doctor had acquired to great a reputation, that henceforth a certain degree of success was insured to everything known or suspected to proceed from his hand. In the course of a few years, the Adventures of Peregrine Pickle appeared; a work of great ingenuity and contrivance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and in which an uncommon degree of erudition is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a>, particularly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the entertainment given by the Republican Doctor, after the manner of the ancients. Under this personage the late Dr Akenfide, author of The Pleasures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a>, is supposed to be typified; and it would be difficult to determine whether profound learning or genuine humour predominate most in this episode. Another episode of The Adventures of a Lady of Quality, likewise inserted in this work, contributed greatly to its success, and is indeed admirably executed; the materials, it is said, the lady herself (the celebrated Lady Vane) furnished.\n\nThese were not the only original compositions of this stamp with which the Doctor has favoured the public. Ferdinand Count Fathom, and Sir Launcelot Greaves, are still in the list of what may be called reading novels, and have gone through several editions; but there is no injustice in placing them in a rank far below the former. No doubt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, character, composition, and contrivance, are to be found in both; but then situations are described which are hardly possible, and characters are painted which, if not altogether unexampled, are at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with modern manners; and which ought not to be, as the scenes are laid in modern times.\n\nThe last work which we believe the Doctor published was of much the same species, but cast into a different form\u2014The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. It consists of a series of letters, written by different persons to their respective correspondents. He has here carefully avoided the faults which may be justly charged to his two former productions. Here are no extravagant characters nor unnatural situations. On the contrary, an admirable knowledge of life and manners is displayed; and most useful lessons are given applicable to interesting but to very common situations.\n\nWe know not whether the remark has been made, but there is certainly a very obvious similitude between the characters of the three heroes of the Doctor's chief productions. Roderic Random, Peregrine Pickle, and Matthew Bramble, are all brothers of the same family. The same satirical, cynical disposition, the same generosity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, are the distinguishing and characteristic features of all three; but they are far from being fertile copies or imitations of each other. They differ as much as the Ajax, Diomed, and Achilles of Homer. This was undoubtedly a great effort of genius; and the Doctor seems to have described his own character at the different stages and situations of his life.\n\nBefore he took a house at Chelsea, he attempted to settle as practitioner of physic at Bath; and with that view wrote a treatise on the waters; but was unsuccessful, chiefly because he could not render himself agreeable to the women, whose favour is certainly of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to all candidates for eminence, whether in medicine or divinity. This, however, was a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>; for those who remembered Dr Smollet at that time, cannot but acknowledge that he was as graceful and handsome a man as any of the age he lived in; besides,\nbesides, there was a certain dignity in his air and manner which could not but inspire respect wherever he appeared. Perhaps he was too soon discouraged; in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, had he persevered, a man of his great learning, profound sagacity, and intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, besides being endowed with every other external as well as internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>, must have at last succeeded, and had he attained to common old age, been at the head of his profession.\n\nAbandoning physic altogether as a profession, he fixed his residence at Chelsea, and turned his thoughts entirely to writing. Yet, as an author, he was not near so successful as his happy genius and acknowledged merit certainly deserved. He never acquired a patron among the great, who by his favour or beneficence relieved him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of writing for a subsistence. The truth is, Dr Smollet possessed a loftiness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of sentiment and character which appear to have disqualified him for paying court to those who were capable of conferring favours. It would be wrong to call this disposition pride or haughtiness; for to his equals and inferiors he was ever polite, friendly, and generous. Bookellers may therefore be said to have been his only patrons; and from them he had constant employment in translating, compiling, and reviewing. He translated Gil Blas and Don Quixote, both so happily, that all the former translations of these excellent productions of genius have been almost superceded by his. His name likewise appears to a translation of Voltaire's Prole Works; but little of it was done by his own hand; he only revised it, and added a few notes. He was concerned in a great variety of compilations. His History of England was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> work of that kind. It had a most extensive sale; and the Doctor is said to have received 200l. for writing it and the continuation.\n\nIn 1755 he set on foot the Critical Review, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> the principal manager of it till he went abroad for the first time in the year 1763. He was perhaps too acrimonious sometimes in the conduct of that work; and at the same time displayed too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> when any of the unfortunate authors attempted to retaliate whose works he had perhaps justly censured.\n\nAmong other controversies in which his engagements in this publication involved him, the most material in its consequences was that occasioned by his remarks on a pamphlet published by Admiral Knowles. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, in defence of his conduct on the expedition to Rochfort, published a vindication of himself; which falling under the Doctor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, produced some very severe strictures both on the performance and on the character of the writer. The admiral immediately commenced a prosecution against the printer; declaring at the same time that he desired only to be informed who the writer was, that if he proved to be a gentleman he might obtain the satisfaction of one from him. In this affair the Doctor behaved both with prudence and with spirit. Devoid of compromising the dispute with the admiral in an amicable manner, he applied to his friend Mr Wilkes to interpose his good offices with his opponent. The admiral, however, was inflexible; and just as sentence was going to be pronounced against the printer, the Doctor came into court, avowed himself the author of the strictures, and declared himself ready to give Mr Knowles any satisfaction he chose.\n\nThe admiral immediately commenced a fresh action against the Doctor, who was found guilty, fined 100l., and condemned to three months <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a> in the King's Bench. It is there he is said to have written the Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves, in which he has described some remarkable characters, then his fellow-prisoners.\n\nWhen Lord Bute was called to the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of affairs, he was prevailed upon to write in defence of that nobleman's measures; which he did in a weekly paper called the Briton. This gave rise to the famous North Briton; wherein, according to the opinion of the public, he was rather baffled. The truth is, the Doctor did not seem to possess the talents necessary for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol1.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a>. He wanted temper and coolness; and his friends accused his patron of having denied him the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, and even neglected the fulfilling of some of his other engagements with him. Be that as it will, the Doctor is said not to have forgotten him in his subsequent performances.\n\nBesides the Briton, Dr Smollet is supposed to have written other pieces in support of the cause he espoused. The Adventures of an Atom, in two volumes, are known to be his production.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> being at last greatly impaired by a sedentary life and studious application to study, he went abroad for his health in June 1763, and continued in France and Italy two years. He wrote an account of his travels in a series of letters to some friends, which were afterwards published in two volumes octavo, 1766. During all that time he appears to have laboured under a constant fit of chagrin. A very slight perusal of these letters will sufficiently evince that this observation is founded in fact, and is indeed a melancholy instance of the influence of bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> over the best disposition.\n\nHis relation of his travels is actually cynical; for which Sterne, in his Sentimental Journey, has animadverted on him under the character of Smelfungus. The Doctor lived to return to his native country; but his health continuing to decline, and meeting with fresh mortifications and disappointments, he went back to Italy, where he died in October 21, 1771. He was employed, during the last years of his life, in abridging the Modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History, great part of which he had originally written himself, particularly the histories of France, Italy, and Germany.\n\nHe certainly met with many mortifications and disappointments; which, in a letter to Mr Garrick, he thus feelingly expresses: \"I am old enough to have seen and observed, that we are all playthings of Fortune; and that it depends upon something as insignificant and precarious as the tossing up of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALFPENNY\">halfpenny</a>, whether a man rises to affluence and honours, or continues to his dying day struggling with the difficulties and disgraces of life.\"\n\nIt would be needless to expatiate on the character of a man so well known as Dr Smollet, who has, besides, given so many strictures of his own character and manner of living in his writings, particularly in Humphrey Clinker; where he appears under the appellation of Mr Serle, and has an interview with Mr Bramble; and his manner of living is described in another letter, where young Melford is supposed to dine with him at his house in Chelsea. No doubt he made money by his connec-\nSmollett, tions with the bookellers; and had he been a rigid smuggler, economift, or ended with the gift of retention (an expression of his own), he might have lived and died very independent. However, to do justice to his memory, his difficulties, whatever they were, proceeded not from extravagance or want of economy. He was hospitable, but not ostentatiously so; and his table was plentiful, but not extravagant. No doubt he had his failings; but still it would be difficult to name a man who was so respectable for the qualities of his head, or more amiable for the virtues of his heart.\n\nSince his death a monument has been erected to his memory near Leghorn, on which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> an epitaph written in Latin by his friend Dr Armstrong, author of The Art of Preserving Health, and many other excellent pieces. An inscription written in Latin was likewise inscribed on a pillar erected to his memory on the banks of the Leven, by one of his relations.\n\nTo these memoirs we are extremely sorry to add, that so late as 1785 the widow of Dr Smollett was residing in indigent circumstances at Leghorn. On this account the tragedy of Venice Preserved was acted for her benefit at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> on the 5th of March, and an excellent prologue spoken on that occasion.\n\nThe pieces inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> collection of Dr Smollett's plays and poems are, The Regicide, a tragedy; The Reproof, a comedy; Advice and Reproof, two satires; The Tears of Scotland; Verses on a Young Lady; a Love Elegy, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of Tibullus; two Songs; a Burlesque Ode; Odes to Mirth, to Sleep, to Leven Water, to Blue-eyed Ann, and to Independence.","sp":29,"ep":32},{"h":"SMUGGLERS","t":"persons who import or export prohibited goods without paying the duties appointed by the law.\n\nThe duties of customs, it is said, were originally instituted, in order to enable the king to afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> to trade against pirates; they have since been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> as a branch of the public revenue. As duties imposed upon the importation of goods necessarily raise their price above what they might otherwise have been sold for, a temptation is presented to import the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> clandestinely and to evade the duty. Many persons, prompted by the hopes of gain, and considering the violation of a positive law of this nature as in no respect criminal (an idea in which they have been encouraged by a great part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, who make no scruple to purchase smuggled goods), have engaged in this illicit trade. It was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> could permit this practice, which is highly injurious to the fair trader, as the smuggler is enabled to undersell him, while at the same time he impairs the national revenue, and thus wholly destroys the end for which these duties were appointed. Such penalties are therefore inflicted as it was thought would prevent smuggling.\n\nMany laws have been made with this view. If any goods be shipped or landed without warrant and presence of an officer, the vessel shall be forfeited, and the wharfinger shall forfeit 100l. and the master or mariner of any ship inward bound shall forfeit the value of the goods; and any carrier, porter, or other assailing, shall be committed to gaol, till he find surety of his good behaviour, or until he shall be discharged by the court of exchequer (13 & 14 C. II. c. 11.) If goods be landed after drawback, the vessel and goods shall be forfeited; and every person concerned therein shall forfeit double the value of the drawback (8 An. c. 13.) Goods taken in at sea shall be forfeited, and also the vessel into which they are taken; and every person concerned therein shall forfeit treble value (9 G. II. c. 35.) A vessel hovering near the coast shall be forfeited, if under 50 tons burden; and the goods shall also be forfeited, or the value thereof (5 G. III. c. 43.) Persons receiving or buying run goods shall forfeit 20l. (8 G. c. 18.) A concealer of run goods shall forfeit treble value (8 G. c. 18.) Offering run goods to sale, the same shall be forfeited, and the person to whom they are offered may seize them; and the person offering them to sale shall forfeit treble value (11 G. c. 39.) A porter or other person carrying run goods shall forfeit treble value (9 G. II. c. 35.) Persons armed or disguised carrying run goods shall be guilty of felony, and transported for seven years (8 G. c. 18. 9 G. II. c. 35.)\n\nBut the last statute, 19 G. II. c. 34. is for this purpose infaust omnium; for it makes all forcible acts of smuggling, carried on in defiance of the laws, or even in disguise to evade them, felony without benefit of clergy: enabling, that if three or more persons shall assemble, with fire-arms or other offensive weapons, to assist in the illegal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> or importation of goods, or in rescuing the same after seizure, or in rescuing offenders in custody for such offences: or shall pass with such goods in disguise; or shall wound, shoot at, or assault, any officers of the revenue when in the execution of their duty; such persons shall be felons, without the benefit of clergy.\n\nWhen we consider the nature, and still more the history of mankind, we must allow that the enacting of severe penal laws is not the way to prevent crimes. It were indeed much to be wished that there were no such thing as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> crime; for the generality of men, but especially the lower orders, not discerning the propriety or utility of such laws, consider them as oppressive and tyrannical, and never hesitate to violate them when they can do it with impunity. Instead therefore of punishing smugglers, it would be much better to remove the temptation. But the high duties which have been imposed upon the importation of many different sorts of foreign goods, in order to discourage their consumption in Great Britain, have in many cases served only to encourage smuggling; and in all cases have reduced the revenue of the customs below what more moderate duties would have afforded. The saying of Dr Swift, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> of the customs two and two, instead of making four, make sometimes only one, holds perfectly true with regard to such heavy duties, which never could have been imposed, had not the mercantile system taught us, in many cases, to employ taxation as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, not of revenue, but of monopoly.\n\nThe bounties which are sometimes given upon the exportation of home produce and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and the drawbacks which are paid upon the re-exportation of the greater part of foreign goods, have given occasion to many frauds, and to a species of smuggling more destructive of the public revenue than any other. In order to obtain the bounty or drawback, the goods, it is well known, are sometimes shipped and sent to sea, but soon\nHeavy duties being imposed upon almost all goods imported, our merchant importers smuggle as much, and make entry of as little as they can. Our merchant exporters, on the contrary, make entry of more than they export; sometimes out of vanity, and to pay for great dealers in goods which pay no duty; and sometimes to gain a bounty or a drawback. Our exports, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these different frauds, appear upon the customhouse books greatly to overbalance our imports; to the unspeakable comfort of those politicians who measure the national prosperity by what they call the balance of trade.","sp":32,"ep":33},{"h":"SMYRNA","t":"or IMSIR, at present the largest and richest city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia Minor</a>, is situated in north latitude 38\u00b0 28', and in E. Long. 27\u00b0 25' from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>, and about 183 miles west by south of Constantinople. The town extends along the shore about half a mile on a gentle declivity. The houses of the English, French, and Dutch consuls are handsome structures; these, with most of those occupied by the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, are washed on one side by the sea, forming a street named Frank-Street, from its being solely inhabited by European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. In the year 1763 the whole of this quarter was consumed by fire: the loss sustained by this calamity in merchandise was estimated at a million and a half of Turkish dollars, or near 200,000 sterling. The port is one of the finest of the Levant, it being able to contain the largest fleet; and indeed there are seldom in it fewer than 100 ships of different nations.\n\nA castle stands at its entrance, and commands all the shipping which fall in or out. There is likewise an old ruinous castle, near a mile in circumference, which stands in the upper part of the city, and, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, was built by the empress Helena; and near it is an ancient structure, said to be the remains of a palace where the Greek council was held when Smyrna was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of Asia Minor. They also show the ruins of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, where it is said St Polycarp, the first bishop, fought with lions.\n\nThis city is about four miles in circumference, and nearly of a triangular form; but the side next the mountain is much longer than the other sides. The houses are low, and mostly built with clay walls, on account of the earthquakes to which the country is subject; but the caravanserais and some other of the public buildings have an air of magnificence. The streets are wide, and almost a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> bazaar, in which a great part of the merchandise of Europe and Asia is exposed to sale, with plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; though these are not so cheap as in many other parts of Turkey, on account of the populousness of the place, and the great resort of foreigners. It is said to contain 15,000 Turks, 10,000 Greeks, 1,800 Jews, 200 Armenians, and 200 Franks; but the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> is computed at 120,000. The Turks have 19 mosques; two churches belong to the Greeks; one to the Armenians; and the Jews have eight synagogues. The Romanists have three convents. There is also one of the fathers Della Terra Santa. Here resides an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of the Greek church; a Latin bishop who has a salary from Rome, Smyrna with the title of bishop of Smyrna in partibus infidelium; and the English and Dutch factories have each their chaplain.\n\nThe walks about the town are extremely pleasant, particularly on the west side of Frank Street, where there are several little groves of orange and lemon trees, which being always clothed with leaves, blossoms, and fruit, regale several of the fencibles at the same time. The vines which cover the little hills about Smyrna afford both a delightful prospect and plenty of grapes, of which good wine is made. These hills are agreeably interspersed with fertile plains, little forests of olives and other fruit-trees, and many pleasure-houses, to which the Franks usually retire during the summer. In the neighbourhood of Smyrna is great plenty of game and wild-fowl, and particularly deer and wild-hogs. The sea also abounds with a variety of good fish. The European Christians are here allowed all imaginable liberties, and usually clothe themselves after the European manner.\n\nThe chief commerce of this city consists in raw silk, silk-stuffs, grogram, and cotton yarn.\n\nHowever, the unhealthfulness of the situation, and more especially the frequent earthquakes, from which, it is said, they are scarcely ever free for two years together, and which have been felt 49 days successively, are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABATEMENT\">abatement</a> of the pleasure that might otherwise be enjoyed here. A very dreadful one happened in June 1688, which overthrew a great number of the houses; and the rock opening where the cattle flood, swallowed it up, and no less than 5000 persons perished on this occasion.\n\nIn the year 1758, so desolating a plague raged here, that scarcely a sufficient number of the inhabitants survived to gather in the fruits of the earth. In the year 1772, three-fourths parts of the city were consumed by fire; and five years after it was visited by the most dreadful earthquakes, which continued from the 23rd of June to the 5th of July; by which successive calamities the city has been so much reduced, that its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> is never likely to be restored.\n\nThe ladies here wear the oriental dress, consisting of large trousers or breeches, which reach to the ankle; long veils of rich silk or velvet, lined in winter with costly furs; and round their waist an embroidered zone with clasps of silver or gold. Their hair is plaited, and descends down the back often in great profusion. The girls have sometimes above twenty thick tresses, besides two or three encircling the head as a coronet, and set off with flowers and plumes of feathers, pearls, or other jewels. They commonly tinge it of a chestnut colour, which is the most desired. Their apparel and carriage are alike antique.

They seem indeed dispersed in great plenty throughout the world, but nowhere are found in greater numbers, beauty, and variety, than in our island.\n\nMr Harenberg found prodigious numbers of them on the banks of a river in Germany. He traced this river through its several windings for many miles, and among a great variety of selemnite, cornua ammonis, and cochlite, of various kinds; he found also great quantities of wood of recent petrifaction, which still preserved plain marks of the axe by which it had been cut from the trees then growing on the shore. The water of this river he found in dry seasons, when its natural springs were not diluted with rains, to be considerably heavier than common water; and many experiments showed him that it contained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a>, as well as stony particles, in great quantity, whence the petrifications in it appeared the less wonderful, though many of them of recent date.\n\nOf the cornua ammonis, or serpent-stones, he there observed more than 30 different species. They lie immersed in a bluish fossil stone, of a soft texture and fatty appearance, in prodigious numbers, and of a great variety of sizes, from the larger known forts down to such as could not be seen without very accurate inspection or the affluence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>. Such as lie in the softest of these stones are soft like their matrix, and easily crumble to pieces; others are harder. In a piece of this stone, of the bigness of a finger, it is common to find 30 or more of these fossils; and often they are seen only in form of white specks, so minute that their figure cannot be distinguished till examined by the microscope.\n\nThey all consist of several volutes, which are different in number in the different species, and their size also are extremely various; some very deep with very high ridges between them, others very flat; some straight, others crooked; others undulated, and some terminating in dots, tubercles, or cavities, towards the back, and others having tubercles in two or three places. They are all composed of a great number of chambers or cells, in the manner of the nautilus Graecorum, each having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the others, by means of a pipe or siphunculus. There is a small white shell fifth of Barbadoes, which seems truly a recent animal of this genus; and in the East Indies there is another also, small and grayish; but the large and beautifully marked ones are found only fossil.\n\nThey are composed of various fossil bodies, often of quarry stone, sometimes of the matter of the common pyrites, and of a great variety of other substances; and though they appear usually mere stones, yet in some the pearly part of the original shell is preserved in all its beauty. Sometimes also, while the outer substance is of the matter of the pyrites, or other coarse, stony, or mineral matter, the inner cavity is filled with a pure white spar of the common plated texture. This gives a great beauty to the specimen. The cornua ammonis, or snake-stones, are found in many parts of England, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, where they are very plentiful in the alum rocks of several sizes.\n\nSNAKE-Root.

It is caused by the irritation of the upper membrane of the nose, occasioned by acid substances floating in the air, or by medicines called flernatory.\n\nThis irritation is performed either externally, by strong smells, as marjoram, roses, &c., or by dust floating in the air, and taken in by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>; or by sharp pungent medicines, as cretis and other irritants, which inflame the membrane of the nose; or internally, by the acrimony of the lympha or mucus, which naturally moistens that membrane. The matters cast forth in sneezing come primarily from the nose and throat; the pituitary membrane continually exuding a mucous thither; and, secondarily, from the breast, the trachea, and the bronchia of the lungs.\n\nThe practice of saluting the person who sneezed existed in Africa, among nations unknown to the Greeks and Romans. The accounts we have of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-MONOMOTAPA\">Monomotapa</a> inform us *, that when the prince sneezes, all his subjects in the capital are advertised of it, that they may offer up prayers for his safety. The author of the conquest of Peru assures us, that the cacique of Guachoa having sneezed in presence of the Spaniards, the Indians of his train fell prostrate before him, stretched forth their hands, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> to him the accustomed marks of respect, while they invoked the sun to enlighten him, to defend him, and to be his constant guard.\n\nEvery body knows that the Romans saluted each other on these occasions: and Pliny relates \u2020, that Tiberius exacted these signs of homage when drawn in his chariot. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">Superstition</a>, whose influence can debase every thing, has degraded this custom for several ages, by attaching favourable or unfavourable omens to sneezing according to the hour of the day or night, according to the signs of the zodiac, according as a work was more or less advanced, or according as one had sneezed to the right or to the left \u2021. If a man sneezed at rising from table or from his bed, it was necessary for him to sit or lie down again. You are struck with astonishment, said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMOTHEUS\">Timotheus</a> to the Athenians, who wished to return into the harbour with their fleet \u00a7, because he had sneezed; you are struck with astonishment, because among 10,000 lib. i. cap. there is one man whose brain is moist.\n\nPolydore Virgil pretends, that in the time of Gregory the Great, there reigned in Italy an epidemic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>, which carried off by sneezing all those who were seized by it; and that this pontiff ordered prayers to be made against it, accompanied by certain signs of the crops. But besides that, there are very few cases in which sneezing can be considered as dangerous, and that it is frequently a favourable symptom ||: it is evident, that we ought not to date from the sixth century the origin of a custom which loses itself in the obscurity of antiquity. Avicenna and Cardan say, it is a sort of convulsion, which gives occasion to dread an epilepsy, and that\nSNE\n\nthat this disease is endeavoured to be warded off by prayers. Clement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> considers it as a mark of intemperance and effeminacy, which ought to be proscribed. And he inveighs bitterly against those who endeavour to procure sneezing by external aid. Montaigne, on the contrary, explains this fact in a tone rather cynical. It is singular enough, that so many ridiculous, contradictory, and superstitious opinions have not abolished those customary civilities which are still preserved equally among high and low; and which only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANABAPTISTS\">Anabaptists</a> and Quakers have rejected, because they have renounced salutations in every case.\n\nAmong the Greeks sneezing was almost always a good omen. It excited marks of tenderness, of respect, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>. The genius of Socrates informed him by sneezing, when it was necessary to perform any action. The young Parthenis, hurried on by her passion, resolved to write to Sarpedon an avowal of her love; she sneezes in the most tender and impassioned part of her letter: This is sufficient for her; this incident supplies the place of an answer, and persuades her that Sarpedon is her lover. Penelope, harassed by the vexatious courtship of her suitors, begins to curse them all, and to pour forth vows for the return of Ulysses. Her son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TELEMACHUS\">Telemachus</a> interrupts her by a loud sneeze. She instantly exults with joy, and regards this sign as an assurance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> return of her husband. Xenophon was haranguing his troops; a soldier sneezed in the moment when he was exhorting them to embrace a dangerous but necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. The whole army, moved by this prelude, determine to pursue the project of their general; and Xerophon orders sacrifices to Jupiter the preserver.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> reverence for sneezing, so ancient and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> even in the times of Homer, always excited the curiosity of the Greek philosophers and of the rabbins.

His discoveries on this subject are contained in a work called *Willebrodi Snelli Cyclometricus de Circuli Dimensione*, &c., Lugd. Bat. 1621.\n\nDescartes found also a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, which being repeated continually, gave the circumference, and from which he might easily have deduced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> in the form of a series.\n\nGregory of St Vincent distinguished himself also on this subject. It is true he committed a great error in supposing he had discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> of both the circle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>; but he had previously made so many beautiful geometrical discoveries, deduced with much elegance after the manner of the ancients, that Squaring, it would be wrong to number him with those absurd pretenders which we have already noticed. Gregory's mistake was the cause of a sharp controversy carried on between his disciples on the one side, and by Huygens, Mercenius and Leffaud on the other; and it was this that gave Huygens occasion to consider particularly the quadrature of the circle, and to investigate various new and curious theorems relating to it, which are contained in his *Theoremata de Quadratura Hyperboles, Ellipsis et Circuli*, 1651; and in his work *De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa*, 1654. In particular he showed, that if \\(c\\) denote the chord of an arch, and \\(s\\) its sine, then the arch itself will be greater than \\(c + \\frac{s}{2} (c - s)\\), but less than \\(c + \\frac{4c + s}{2c + 3s} \\times \\frac{1}{2} (c - s)\\): he also showed that the arch is less than the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of its sine and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of its tangent. These theorems greatly shorten the labour of approximating to the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> and circumscribed figures, insomuch that by the inscribed polygons of 6 and 12 sides, we may obtain it to the same degree of accuracy as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> did by the inscribed and circumscribed polygons of 96 sides.\n\nJames Gregory, in his *Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura*, gave several curious theorems upon the relation of the circle to its inscribed and circumscribed polygons, and their ratios to one another; and by means of these he found with infinitely less trouble than by the ordinary methods, and even by those of Snellius, the measure of the circle as far as 20 places of figures. He gave also, after the example of Huygens, constructions for finding straight lines nearly equal to arches of a circle, and of which the degree of accuracy was greater. For example, he found that if \\(A\\) be put for the chord of an arch of a circle, and \\(B\\) for twice the chord of half the arch, and \\(C\\) be taken such that \\(A : B : B : 2B : C\\), then the arch itself is nearly equal to \\(\\frac{8C + 8B - A}{15}\\), but a little less, the error in the case of a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> being less than its \\(\\frac{1}{3800}\\) part; and when the arch does not exceed 12\u00b0, it is less than its \\(\\frac{1}{4000}\\) part; and finally, for a quadrant the error is not greater than its \\(\\frac{1}{10000}\\) part. And farther, that if \\(D\\) be such that \\(A : B : B : D\\), then the arch is nearly equal to \\(\\frac{12C + 4B - D}{15}\\), but a little greater, the error in the semicircle being less than its \\(\\frac{1}{3800}\\) part, and in a quadrant less than its \\(\\frac{1}{4000}\\) part.\n\nThe discoveries of Dr Wallis, delivered in his *Arithmetica Infinitorum* published in 1655, led him to a singular expression for the ratio of the circle to the square of its diameter. He found that the former was to the latter as 1 to the product\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\times 11 \\times 11}{2 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 12}\n\\]\n\nthe fractions \\(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{1}{11}, \\frac{1}{13}, \\ldots\\) being supposed infinite in number. The products being supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to infinity, we have the ratio exactly; but if we stop at any finite number of terms, as must necessarily be the case in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, the result will be alternately too great and too small, according as we take an odd or an even number of terms of the numerator and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a>.\nSquaring. Thus the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) is too great; on the other hand,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\times 3}{2 \\times 4} = \\frac{9}{8} \\text{ is too small, and } \\frac{3 \\times 3 \\times 5}{2 \\times 4 \\times 4} = \\frac{45}{32} \\text{ too great,}\n\\]\n\nand so on. But to approach as near as possible in each case, Wallis directs to multiply the product by the square root of a fraction formed by adding to unity the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> of the last factor in either its numerator or denominator; then the result, although much nearer, will be too great if the number whose reciprocal is taken be the last in the numerator, but too small if it be the number in the denominator. Thus the following series of expressions will give approximate values of the infinite product\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 7}{2 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\times 8} \\text{ which are alternately too great and too small.}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6} \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{1}{5})}; \\quad \\frac{3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6} \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{1}{5})};\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8} \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{1}{7})}; \\quad \\frac{3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8} \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{1}{7})}; \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nThese values, alternately too great and too small, fall between the known limits.\n\nAn expression of another kind for the ratio of the circle to the square of the diameter was found by Lord Brouncker. He showed that the circle being unity, the square of the diameter is expressed by the continued fraction\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{9}{2 + \\frac{25}{2 + \\frac{49}{2 + \\text{&c.}}}}}\n\\]\n\nwhich is supposed to go on to infinity, the numerators 1, 9, 25, 49, &c. being the squares of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &c. By taking two, three, four, &c. terms of this fraction, we shall have a series of approximate values which are alternately greater and less than its accurate value.\n\nSuch were the chief discoveries relating to the quadrature of the circle made before the time of Newton: many others, however, were quickly added by that truly great man, as well as by his contemporaries. In particular, Newton himself showed that if \\( s \\) denote the sine, and \\( v \\) the versed sine of an arch, then the radius being unity, the arch is equal to either of the following series,\n\n\\[\ns + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2v} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9} + \\text{&c.}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAnd James Gregory found that \\( t \\) being put for the tangent, the arch is expressed by the very simple series\n\n\\[\nt - \\frac{t^3}{3} + \\frac{t^5}{5} - \\frac{t^7}{7} + \\frac{t^9}{9} - \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nWe have investigated the first of these series at \u00a7 140, and the third at \u00a7 137, of the article Fluxions: the Squaring second is easily obtained from the first by considering that since the sine of an arch is half the chord of twice the arch, that is, half of a mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> between the diameter and versed sine of twice the arch; we have therefore only to multiply the first series by 2, and to substitute \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sqrt{2v} \\) instead of \\( s \\), and we get the second series.\n\nBy taking \\( s = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), then, because in this case the arch contains 30\u00b0, we have half the circumference to the radius 1, or the whole circumference to the diameter 1, expressed by the infinite series\n\n\\[\n3 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^2} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2^4} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2^6} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2^8} + \\text{&c.}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAnd by supposing that in the third series \\( t = 1 \\), in which case the arch is one-eighth of the circumference, we have the same things expressed by the series\n\n\\[\n4 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{11} + \\text{&c.}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhich was given by Leibnitz as a quadrature of the circle in the Leipzig Acts in the year 1682; but was discovered by him 1673. Gregory, however, had found the series under its general form several years before. By the first of these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> series we can readily compute the circumference of the circle to a tolerable degree of accuracy; but the second is altogether inapplicable in its present form on account of the slowness of its convergency; for Newton has observed that to exhibit its value exact to twenty places of figures, there would be occasion for no less than five thousand millions of its terms, to compute which would take up above a thousand years.\n\nThe slowness of the convergency has arisen from our supposing \\( t = 1 \\). If we had supposed \\( t \\) greater than 1, then the series would not have converged at all, but on the contrary diverged. But by giving to \\( t \\) a value less than 1, then the rate of convergency will be increased, and that so much the more, as \\( t \\) is smaller.\n\nIf we suppose the arch of which \\( t \\) is the tangent to be 30\u00b0, then \\( t \\) will be \\( \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{3} \\), and therefore half the circumference to radius unity, or the circumference to the diameter unity, which in this case is \\( 6t \\left(1 - \\frac{t^2}{3} + \\frac{t^4}{5} - \\frac{t^6}{7} + \\frac{t^8}{9} - \\text{&c.}\\right) \\) will be\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{12} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^2} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 3^3} + \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 3^4} - \\text{&c.}\\right).\n\\]\n\nBy means of this series, in an hour's time the circumference may be found to be nearly 3.141592653590, which is true to 11 decimal places, and is a very considerable degree of accuracy, considering the smallness of the labour. But Mr Machin, enticed by the easiness of the process, was induced, about the beginning of the last century, to continue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> as far as 100 places of figures, thus finding the diameter to be to the circumference as 1 to 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974945923078164062862089986280348253421170680. After him, De Lagny continued it as far as\nSquaring. 128 figures. But he has also been outdone; for in Radcliffe's library at Oxford, there is a manuscript in which it is carried as far as 150 figures!\n\nAlthough this last series, which was first proposed by Dr Halley, gives the ratio of the diameter to the circumference with wonderful facility when compared with the operose method employed by Van Ceulen, yet others have been since found which accomplish it with still greater ease. In Halley's series we have to compute the irrational quantity \\( \\sqrt{12} \\), because of the irrational value which it is necessary to give to \\( t \\) in order to render it sufficiently small, and at the same time an exact part of the whole circumference; but Mr Machin contrived, by a very ingenious artifice, to reduce the computation of an arch of 45\u00b0, and consequently the length of the whole circumference, to two series which contain only rational quantities, and which at the same time converge with great rapidity. The nature of this artifice, and the manner in which it occurred to its author, is explained by Dr Hutton in his very excellent treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">Mensuration</a>, as follows: \"Since the chief advantage (in the application of Gregory's series to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTIFICATION\">rectification</a> of the circle) consists in taking small arches, whose tangents shall be numbers easy to manage, Mr Machin very properly considered, that since the tangent of 45\u00b0 is 1, and that the tangent of any arch being given, the tangent of the double of that arch can easily be had; if there be assumed some final simple number as the tangent of an arch, and then the tangent of the double arch be continually taken, until a tangent be found nearly equal to 1, which is the tangent of 45\u00b0, by taking the tangent answering to the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of 45\u00b0 and this multiple, there would be found two very small tangents, viz. the tangent first assumed, and the tangent of the difference between 45\u00b0 and the multiple arch; and that therefore the lengths of the arches corresponding to these two tangents being calculated, and the arch belonging to the tangent first assumed being often doubled as the multiple directs, the result, increased or diminished by the other arch, according as the multiple should be below or above it, would be the arch of 45\u00b0.\n\n\"Having thus thought of his method, by a few trials he was lucky enough to find a number (and perhaps the only one) proper for his purpose; viz. knowing that the tangent of \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) of 45\u00b0 is nearly \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), he assumed \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) as the tangent of an arch. Then, since if \\( t \\) be the tangent of an arch, the tangent of the double arch will be \\( \\frac{2t}{1-t^2} \\); the radius being 1; the tangent of the double arch to that of which \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) is the tangent will \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{9}} \\), and the tangent of the double of this arch will be \\( \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{9}} \\), which being very nearly equal to 1, shews, that the arch which is equal to four times the first arch is very near 45\u00b0. Then, since the tangent of the difference between an arch of 45\u00b0, and an arch greater than 45\u00b0, whose tangent is \\( T \\), is \\( \\frac{T-1}{T+1} \\), we shall have the tangent of the difference between 45\u00b0, and the arch whose tangent is \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{9}} \\) equal to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{9}} \\). Now, by calculating from the general series the arches whose tangents are \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{9}} \\), (which may be quickly done by reason of the smallness and simplicity of the numbers), and taking the latter arch from four times the former, the remainder will be the arch of Squaring. 45\u00b0.\"\n\nIf we substitute \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) instead of \\( t \\) in the general series, we shall have the arch whose tangent is \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) expressed by the series \\( \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 5^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 5^5} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 5^7} + \\ldots \\), &c.; and, in like manner, by substituting \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) for \\( t \\), we get the arch whose tangent is \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) expressed by the series \\( \\frac{1}{239} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 239^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 239^5} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 239^7} + \\ldots \\), &c. Now, since four times the arch to tan. \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) diminished by the arch to tan. \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is equal to the arch to tan. 1, that is, to the arch of 45\u00b0, or \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) of the semicircumference; therefore, half the circumference of a circle to rad. = 1, or the whole circumference, the diameter being 1, is equal to\n\n\\[ 16 \\left( \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 5^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 5^5} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 5^7} + \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 5^9} - \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ - 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{239} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 239^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 239^5} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 239^7} + \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 239^9} - \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nand this is Machin's series for the rectification of the circle.\n\nThe happy idea which Machin had conceived of reducing the rectification of the arch whose tangent is unity to that of two arches whose tangents are small rational fractions, having each unity for a numerator, appears also to have occurred to Euler; and the same thought has, since his time, been pursued by other mathematicians, who have contrived to resolve an arch of 45\u00b0 into three or more such arches. We shall show how this may be done, beginning with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the following problem.\n\n**Problem.** Supposing \\( n \\), \\( x \\), and \\( y \\), to denote three whole numbers, such, that the arch whose tangent is \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is equal to the sum of two arches whose tangents are \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\), radius being unity, it is required to determine all possible values of the numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of the number \\( n \\).\n\n**Solution.** It is manifest from the formula for the tangent of the sum of two arches (Algebra, \u00a7 368.) that\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}; \\text{ hence we have } \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{x+y}{xy}, \\text{ and } nx + ny = xy - 1, \\text{ and } y(x-n) = nx + 1; \\text{ and, lastly, } y = \\frac{nx + 1}{x-n} = n + \\frac{1}{x-n}. \\]\n\nNow, as by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, \\( y \\) is a whole number, it is manifest that \\( \\frac{n^2 + 1}{x-n} \\) must be a whole number; therefore, \\( x-n \\) must be a divisor of \\( n^2 + 1 \\). Let \\( p \\) be any divisor of \\( n^2 + 1 \\), and \\( q \\) the quotient, that is, let \\( p \\cdot q = n^2 + 1 \\), then \\( x-n = p \\), and \\( x = n + p \\); And since \\( \\frac{n^2 + 1}{x-n} = \\frac{p}{q} = g \\), therefore \\( y = n + g \\); thus the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are determined in terms of \\( n \\) as required; and by giving to \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) all possible values, we shall have...\nhave all the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that can exist. This solution affords us the following theorem.\n\n**Theorem.** Let \\( n \\) denote any whole number, and let \\( n^2 + 1 \\) be resolved into any two factors \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), (one of which may be unity), that is, let \\( pq = n^2 + 1 \\); the arch whose tangent is \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is equal to the sum of the arches whose tangents are \\( \\frac{1}{n+p} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{n+q} \\) respectively.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, let \\( A_1 = \\frac{1}{n} \\) be put to denote the arch, having for its tangent \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\); then, according to this notation, our theorem will be expressed thus, \\( A_1 = A_1 + A_1 \\).\n\nLet us now suppose \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( n^2 + 1 = 2 = 1 \\times 2 \\), therefore, the only values which we can give in this case to \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are \\( p = 1, q = 2 \\), and these being substituted, we have\n\n\\[ A_1 = A_1 + A_1. \\]\n\nFrom which it appears, that the arch whose tangent is unity (that is, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the circumference), is the sum of the arches whose tangents are \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\). This is Euler's theorem, and by means of it, putting \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) for \\( t \\) in the general series \\( t - \\frac{1}{3}t^3 + \\frac{1}{5}t^5 - \\frac{1}{7}t^7 + \\ldots \\), &c., we get half the circumference to radius 1 equal to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 2^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 2^5} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 2^7} + \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 2^9}, & \\text{&c.} \\\\\n+\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 3^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^5} - \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 3^7} + \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 3^9}, & \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet us now suppose \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( n^2 + 1 = 5 = 1 \\times 5 \\), hence the only values which \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) can have are 1 and 5; and in this case our general formula gives \\( A_1 = A_1 + A_1 \\).\n\nIf now from the two equations\n\n\\[ A_1 = A_1 + A_1; \\quad A_1 = A_1 + A_1, \\]\n\nwe eliminate successively \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_1 \\), we shall obtain the two following:\n\n\\[ A_1 = 2A_1 + A_1; \\quad A_1 = 2A_1 - A_1. \\]\n\nFrom the first of these it appears that \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the circumference is equal to the sum of twice the arch to tan. \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), and once the arch to tan. \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\); and from the second, that the same quantity is equal to the excess of twice the arch to tan. \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) above the arch to tan. \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\); and from each of these, an expression for the whole circumference may be obtained analogous to that which we have found above from Euler's formula, but which will converge faster, and therefore is better.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of an arch of \\( 45^\\circ \\) into three other arches, may be effected by means of our general formula, as follows: Put \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( n^2 + 1 = 10 = 1 \\times 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\), hence we have \\( p = 1, q = 10 \\), and also \\( p = 2, q = 5 \\); therefore, substituting, we get two different values of \\( A_1 \\), viz.\n\n\\[ A_1 = A_1 + A_1; \\quad A_1 = A_1 + A_1. \\]\n\nFrom these, and the equation \\( A_1 = 2A_1 + A_1 \\), we get, by exterminating \\( A_1 \\), the two following expressions for \\( A_1 \\), an arch of \\( 45^\\circ \\).\n\n\\[ A_1 = 2A_1 + A_1 + 2A_1; \\quad A_1 = 2A_1 + A_1 + 2A_1. \\]\n\nThese give each an expression for the circumference composed of three series. The labour, however, of computing by either of them, particularly the latter, will probably be less than by any of the formulas composed of two series, on account of the greater degree of quickness with which the series will converge. All the preceding formulas have been investigated in different ways by different mathematicians. That, however, which we are about to investigate, we believe is new. Let \\( n \\) in the general formula be taken equal to 5; then \\( n^2 + 1 = 26 = 1 \\times 26 = 2 \\times 13 \\), therefore \\( p = 1, q = 26 \\), also \\( p = 2, q = 13 \\), hence we find \\( A_1 = A_1 + A_1 \\), and also \\( A_1 = A_1 + A_1 \\). From this last equation, and the equation \\( A_1 = 2A_1 + A_1 + 2A_1 \\), let \\( A_1 \\) be eliminated, and the result is\n\n\\[ A_1 = 3A_1 + 2A_1 + 2A_1. \\]\n\nThis appears to be the most convenient expression of any we have yet found, because the fractions are smaller, while at the same time two of the denominators consist of only one figure, and the third, which consists of two, admits of being resolved into factors. By the same mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> we have found this expression\n\n\\[ A_1 = 2A_1 + 3A_1 + 2A_1 + 3A_1, \\]\n\nwhich consists of four terms; but for the sake of brevity we omit its investigation.\n\nWe shall now apply the formula \\( A_1 = 3A_1 + 2A_1 + 2A_1 \\) to the actual calculation of the arch of \\( 45^\\circ \\), the radius of the circle being unity.\n\nI.

They are given by Mr W. Wallace of the Royal Military College, in a paper entitled, *New Series for the Quadrature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a>, and the Computation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">Logarithms</a>*. These series do not give the arch directly, but only its reciprocal, or the powers of that reciprocal; it is however evident, that any one of these being known, the arch itself becomes immediately known. The first series is as follows. Let \\(a\\) denote any arch of a circle, and let its tangent, the tangents of its half, &c. be briefly denoted by tan. \\(a\\), tan. \\(\\frac{1}{2}a\\), &c. Then shall\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = \\tan. a + \\frac{1}{2} \\tan. \\frac{1}{2}a + \\frac{1}{3} \\tan. \\frac{1}{3}a + \\ldots + T + T' + S.\n\\]\n\nHere the arches \\(a, \\frac{1}{2}a, \\frac{1}{3}a, \\ldots\\) constitute a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>, having the number of its terms infinite, and their common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The letters \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) are put for any two adjoining terms (after the first) of the series, and \\(S\\) is put for the sum of all the terms following these; and this sum is always contained between two limits, one of which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the latter of the two terms \\(T, T'\\), and the other is a third proportional to their difference; and the last of the two being always less than the first of these limits, but greater than the second. As a specimen of the way of applying this series, we shall give the calculation of the length of an arch of 90\u00b0 to six decimal places. In this case\n\n\\[\n\\tan. a = \\cotan. a = 1,\n\\]\n\nthe remaining quantities tan. \\(\\frac{1}{2}a\\), tan. \\(\\frac{1}{3}a\\), &c. are to be computed from tan. \\(\\frac{1}{2}a\\) by this formula, tan. \\(\\frac{1}{2}A = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tan^2 A} + 1\\right)} - \\frac{1}{\\tan. A}\\).\n\nAccordingly we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan. \\frac{1}{2}a &= 1. \\\\\n\\tan. \\frac{1}{3}a &= .4142136 \\\\\n\\tan. \\frac{1}{4}a &= .1989123 \\\\\n\\tan. \\frac{1}{5}a &= .0984914 \\\\\n\\tan. \\frac{1}{6}a &= .0491268 \\\\\n\\tan. \\frac{1}{7}a &= .0245486 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\tan. \\frac{1}{2}a &= .500000 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} \\tan. \\frac{1}{3}a &= .1035534 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} \\tan. \\frac{1}{4}a &= .0248040 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5} \\tan. \\frac{1}{5}a &= .0061557 \\\\\nT &= \\frac{1}{4} \\tan. \\frac{1}{4}a = .0015352 \\\\\nT' &= \\frac{1}{3} \\tan. \\frac{1}{3}a = .0003836 \\\\\nS &= .0001278 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\(S = .0001278\\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = .6366197\n\\]\n\nArch of 90\u00b0 = \\(a = 1.570796\\).\n\nThe second series given in this paper is expressed as follows. Let cof. \\(a\\), cof. \\(\\frac{1}{2}a\\), &c. denote the cosine of the arch, the cosine of its half, &c. Then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{cof. } \\frac{1}{2}a} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\text{cof. } \\frac{1}{2}a} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{cof. } \\frac{1}{2}a} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\text{cof. } \\frac{1}{2}a} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{cof. } \\frac{1}{2}a} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\text{cof. } \\frac{1}{2}a} \\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, as before, the letters \\(T, T'\\) denote any two adjacent terms of the series in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENTHESIS\">parenthesis</a>, and \\(S\\) is put for the sum of all the following terms, which in this case is always less than \\(\\frac{1}{2}T'\\), but greater than a third proportional to \\(T - T'\\) and \\(T'\\). This second series con-\nSquaring verges quicker than the first, and is besides better adapted to calculation, because the cosines of the series of arches \\( \\frac{1}{2}a, \\frac{3}{4}a, \\ldots \\) are more easily deduced from the cosine of \\( a \\) and one another than the tangents. The formula in this case being \\( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos A}{2}} \\).\n\nThere are various other series for the rectification of any arch of a circle given in the same paper, some of which converge faster than either of the two we have here specified, and all have the property of being applicable to every possible case, and of having very simple limits, between which the sum of all their terms following any proposed term are always contained. It may also be observed that the principles from which they are deduced are of the most simple and elementary kind, inasmuch that the author has stated it as his opinion, that their investigation might even be admitted into and form a part of the elements of geometry.\n\n**Squatina.** See *Squalus*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICHTHYOLOGY\">Ichthyology</a> Index*.\n\n**Squill.** See *Scilla*, *Botany* and *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">Materia Medica</a> Index*.\n\n**Squilla,** the name of a species of cancer.

The offence of mortally stabbing another, though done upon sudden provocation, is punished as murder; the benefit of clergy being taken away from it by statute. (See *Murder*.) For by Ja. I. c. 8. when one thrusts or stabs another, not then having a weapon drawn, or who hath not then first stricken the party stabbing, so that he dies thereof within six months after, the offender shall not have the benefit of clergy, though he did it not of malice aforethought. This statute was made on account of the frequent quarrels and stabbings with short daggers between the Scotch and the English, at the accession of James I.; and being therefore of a temporary nature, ought to have expired with the mischief which it meant to remedy. For, in point of solid and substantial justice, it cannot be said that the mode of killing, whether by stabbing, strangling, or floothing, can either extenuate or enhance the guilt; unless where, as in the case of poisoning, it carries with it internal evidence of cool and deliberate malice. But the benignity of the law hath confirmed the statute to favourably in behalf of the subject, and so strictly when against him, that the offence of stabbing now stands almost upon the same footing as it did at the common law. Thus, (not to repeat the cases mentioned under *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSLAUGHTER\">Manslaughter</a>*, of stabbing an adulterer, &c., which are barely manslaughter, as at common law), in the construction of this statute it hath been doubted, whether, if the deceased had struck at all before the mortal blow given, this does not take it out of the statute, though in the preceding quarrel the stabber had given the first blow; and it seems to be the better opinion, that this is not within the statute. Also it hath been resolved, that the killing a man, by throwing a hammer or other weapon, is not within the statute; and whether a shot with a pistol be so or not is doubted. But if the party slain had a cudgel in his hand, or had thrown a pot or a bottle, or discharged a pistol at the party stabbing, this is a sufficient reason for having a weapon drawn on his side within the words of the statute.\n\n**Stachys**, Hedge-nettle, or All-heal, a genus of plants belonging to the class of didynamia, and order of gymnospermia; and in the natural system arranged under the 42d order, Verticillatae.

Although this office is now abolished by the usurped influence of France, our readers will probably not be ill pleased with a short account of the several powers and claims connected with it. To render that account the more intelligible, we shall trace the office of a stadtholder from its origin.\n\nThe Seven Provinces of the Low Countries were long governed by princes invested with the sovereignty, though limited in their powers, and under various titles; as Counts of Holland, Dukes of Guelder, Bishop of Utrecht, &c. When these countries fell to the princes of the house of Burgundy, and afterwards to those of Austria, who had many other dominions, the absence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> was supplied by a stadtholder or governor, vested with very ample powers. These stadtholders or lieutenants had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and presided in the courts of justice, whose jurisdiction was not at that time confined merely to the trial of causes, but extended to affairs of state. The stadtholders swore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to the princes at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INAUGURATION\">inauguration</a>, jointly with the states of the provinces they governed. They likewise took an oath to the states, by which they promised to maintain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws and privileges.\n\nIt was upon this footing that William the First, prince of Orange, was made governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general of Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht, by Philip the Second, upon his leaving the Low Countries to go into Spain. The troubles beginning soon after, this prince found means to bring about an union, in 1576, between Holland and Zealand; the states of which two provinces put into his hands, as far as was in their power, the sovereign authority (for so long time as they should remain in war and under arms), upon the same footing as Holland had intrusted him with it the year before. In 1581 the same authority was again renewed to him by Holland, as it was soon after by Zealand likewise; and in 1584, being already elected count of Holland, upon certain conditions he would have been formally invested with the sovereignty, had not a wretch hired and employed by the court of Spain, put an end to his life by a horrid assassination.\n\nIn the preamble of the instruments by which the states in 1581 conferred the sovereign authority upon Prince William the First, we find there remarkable words, which are there set down as fundamental rules: \u201cThat all republics and communities ought to preserve...\u201d\nStadthold serve, maintain, and fortify themselves by unanimity; which being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to be kept up always among so many members, often differing in inclinations and sentiments, it is consequently necessary that the government should be placed in the hands of one single chief magistrate.\" Many good politicians, and the greatest part of the inhabitants of these provinces, since the establishment of the republic, looked upon the stadtholderian government as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; nor has she been without a stadtholder but twice, that is to say, from the end of 1650 to 1672, and again from March 1702 till April 1747. The provinces of Friesland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRONINGEN\">Groningen</a>, with Ommeland, had always a stadtholder without interruption: their instructions may be seen in Aitzema; but formerly the powers of the stadtholder of these provinces were confined within narrower bounds, and till William the Fourth there was no stadtholder of the seven provinces together.\n\nThe stadtholder could not declare war or make peace, but he had, in quality of captain general of the union, the command in chief of all the forces of the state (A); and military persons were obliged to obey him in every thing that concerned the service. He was not limited by instructions; but he had the important power of giving out orders for the march of troops, and the disposition of all matters relative to them. He not only directed their marches, but provided for the garrisons, and changed them at pleasure. All military edicts and regulations came from him alone; he constituted and authorized the high council of war of the United Provinces, and, as captain-general of every province, disposed of all military offices, as far as the rank of colonel inclusively. The higher posts, such as those of veld-marlials, generals, lieutenant-generals, major-generals, were given by the states-general, who chose the persons recommended by his highness. He made the governors, commandants, &c., of towns and strong places of the republic, and of the barrier. The persons nominated presented their instruments of appointment to their high mightinesses, who provided them with commissions. The states-general had likewise great regard to the recommendation of the prince stadtholder in the disposition of those civil employments which were in their gift.\n\nThe power of the stadtholder as high-admiral, extended to every thing that concerned the naval force of the republic, and to all the other affairs that were here within the jurisdiction of the admiralty. He presided at these boards either in person or by his representatives; and as chief of them all in general, and of every one in particular, he had power to make their orders and instructions he observed by themselves and others. He bestowed the posts of lieutenant-admiral, vice-admiral, and rear-admiral, who commanded under him; and he made likewise post-captains.\n\nThe stadtholder granted likewise letters of grace, pardon, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a>, as well for the crimes called Com-Stadtholmumia Delicta, as for military offences. In Holland and Zealand these letters were made out for crimes of the first sort, in the name of the states, with the advice of his highness. In military offences he consulted the high council of war; and upon the commonia delicta he took the advice of the courts of justice, of the counsellors, committees of the provinces, of the council of state, and the tribunals of justice in the respective towns, according to the nature of the case.\n\nIn the provinces of Holland and Zealand, the stadtholder elected the magistrates of the towns annually, out of a double number that were returned to him by the towns themselves.\n\nWhen any of these offices became vacant, which, at the time there was no governor, were in the disposal of the states of Holland, or as formerly in that of the chamber of accounts, the stadtholder had his choice of two, or, in some cases, of three candidates, named by their noble and great mightinesses. He chose likewise the counsellors, inspectors of the dykes of Rynland, Delfland, and Scheeland, out of three persons presented to him by the boards of the counsellors inspectors; which boards were of very ancient establishment in Holland.\n\nHis highness presided in the courts of Holland, and in the courts of justice of the other provinces; and his name was placed at the head of the proclamations and acts, called in Dutch Mandamenten, or Provisien van Justitie. In Overijssel and in the province of Utrecht the possessors of fees held of the prince stadtholder. He was supreme curator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of Guelder, Friesland, and Groningen; grand forester and grand veneer in Guelder, in Holland, and other places. In the province of Utrecht, his highness, by virtue of the regulation of 1674, disposed of the provostships and other benefices which remained to the chapters, as also of the canonical prebends that fell in the months which were formerly the papal months.\n\nBy the first article of the council of state of the United Provinces, the stadtholder was the first member of it, and had a right of voting there, with an appointment of 25,000 guilders a-year. He assisted also, as often as he thought fit for the service of the state, at the deliberations of the states-general, to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> to them, and sometimes also at the conferences which the deputies of their high mightinesses held in their different committees, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their standing orders. He likewise assisted at the assemblies of the states of each particular province, and at that of the counsellors committees. In Guelder, Holland, and Utrecht, his highness had a share of the sovereignty, as chief or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the body of nobles; and in Zeeland, where he possessed the marquisate of Veer and Flushing, as first noble, and representing the whole nobility. In his absence he had\n\n(A) In times of war, however, the states had always named deputies for the army, to accompany the stadtholders in the field, and to serve them as counsellors in all their enterprises, particularly in the most important affairs, such as giving battle, or undertaking a siege, &c. This was always practised till the accession of King William the Third to the crown of Great Britain, and after his death was continued with regard to the general-in-chief of the army of the republic. In 1747 and 1748 there were likewise deputies with the army, but with more limited power.\nStadtholder had in Zealand his representatives, who had the first place and the first voice in all the councils, and the first of whom was always first deputy from the province to the assembly of their high mightinesses.\n\nIn 1749 the prince stadtholder was created by the states-general, governor-general and supreme director of the East and West India companies; dignities which gave him a great deal of authority and power, and which had never been conferred upon any of his predecessors, nor had they hitherto been made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>. He had his representatives in the several chambers of the company, and chose their directors out of a nomination of three qualified persons. The prince enjoyed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> in Zealand from the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> to the stadtholderate.\n\nThe revenues of the stadtholderate of the seven United Provinces were reckoned (including the 25,000 guilders which the prince enjoyed annually as the first member of the council of state, and what he had from the India company's dividends) to amount to 300,000 guilders a-year. As captain-general of the union, his serene highness had 120,000 guilders per annum; besides 24,000 from Friesland, and 12,000 from Groningen, in quality of captain-general of those provinces. In times of war the state allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> sums to the captain-general for the expense of every campaign.\n\nAll these powers and privileges were held by the prince of Orange previous to the revolutionary war of France. The influence of the usurper of that kingdom has extended to the states of Holland, and attached them as a province to France under the name of a kingdom, at the head of which is a brother of Bonaparte.\n\nST\u00c6HELINA, a genus of plants belonging to the class of syngenesia, and order of polygamy aquilis; and in the natural system arranged under the 49th order, Compositae.

In dying persons this affection is called by the Greeks gryzes, rhenchos, which is a snoring or rattling kind of noise, proceeding as it were from a conflict between the breath and the humours in the alpura arteria.\n\nThis and such like affections are owing to a weakness of nature, as when the lungs are full of pus or humours: to which purpose we read in the Prognostics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, \"it is a bad sign when there is no expectoration, and no discharge from the lungs, but a noise as from an ebullition is heard in the alpura arteria from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENITUDE\">plenitude</a> of humour.\" Expectoration is suppressed either by the vicissitude of the humour, which requires to be discharged, and which adhering to the alpura arteria, and being there agitated by the breath, excites that bubbling noise or flertor; or by an obstruction of the bronchia; or, lastly, by a compression of the alpura arteria and throat, whence the passage is straitened, in which the humours being agitated, excite such a kind of noise as before described. Hence Galen calls those who are strait-breathed flertorous. That author assigns but two causes of this symptom, which are either the straitness of the passage of respiration or redundancy of humours, or both together; but it is necessary to add a third, to wit, the weakness of the faculty, which is the cause of the rhenchos in dying persons, where nature is too weak to make discharges.\n\nFrom what has been said we conclude, that this symptom, or this sort of fervour or ebullition in the throat,","sp":35,"ep":35},{"h":"SNOW","t":"a well known meteor, formed by the freezing of the vapour of water in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. It differs from hail and hoar-frost, in being as it were crystallized, which they are not. This appears on examining a flake of snow by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> glass; when the whole of it will appear to be composed of fine shining spicula diverging like rays from a centre. As the flakes fall down through the atmosphere, they are continually joined by more of these radiated spicula, and thus increase in bulk like the drops of rain or hailstones. Dr Grew, in a discourse of the nature of snow, observes, that many parts thereof are of a regular figure, for the most part flats of five points, and are as perfect and transparent ice as any we see on a pond, &c. Upon each of these points are other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> points, set at the same angles as the main points themselves: among which there are divers other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, which are chiefly broken points, and fragments of the regular ones. Others also, by various winds, seem to have been thawed and frozen again into irregular clusters; so that it seems as if the whole body of snow were an infinite mass of icicles irregularly figured. That is, a cloud of vapours being gathered into drops, the said drops forthwith descend; upon which descent, meeting with a freezing air as they pass through a colder region, each drop is immediately frozen into an icicle, shooting itself forth into several points; but these still continuing their descent, and meeting with some intermittent gales of warmer air, or in their continual waftage to and fro touching upon each other, some of them are a little thawed, blunted, and again frozen into clusters, or entangled so as to fall down in what we call flakes.\n\nThe lightness of snow, although it is firm ice, is owing to the excess of its surface, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> to the matter contained under it; as gold itself may be extended in surface till it ride upon the least breath of air.\n\nThe whiteness of snow is owing to the small particles into which it is divided; for ice, when pounded, will become equally white. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> snow has been made by the following experiment. A tall phial of aquafortis being placed by the fire till it is warm, and filings of pure silver, a few at a time, being put into it; after a brisk ebullition, the silver will dissolve slowly. The phial being then placed in a cold window, as it cools the silver particles will shoot into crystals, several of which running together will form a flake of snow, which will descend to the bottom of the phial. While they are descending, they represent perfectly a shower of silver snow, and the flakes will lie upon one another at the bottom, like real snow upon the ground.\n\nAccording to Signor Beccaria, clouds of snow differ in nothing from clouds of rain, but in the circumstance of cold that freezes them. Both the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the snow, and the regularity of the structure of its parts (particularly some figures of snow or hail which fall about Turin, and which he calls retette), show that clouds of snow are acted upon by some uniform cause like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; and he endeavours to show how electricity is capable of forming these figures. He was confirmed in his conjectures by observing, that his apparatus for obliterating the electricity of the atmosphere never failed to be electrified by snow as well as rain. Professor Winthrop sometimes found his apparatus electrified by snow when driven about by the wind, though it had not been affected by it when the snow itself was falling. A more intense electricity, according to Beccaria, unites the particles of hail more closely than the more moderate electricity does those of snow, in the same manner as we see that the drops of rain which fall from thunder-clouds are larger than those which fall from others, though the former descend through a less space.\n\nBut we are not to consider snow merely as a curious and beautiful phenomenon. The Great Dispenser of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> bounty has so ordered it, that it is eminently subservient, as well as all the works of creation, to his benevolent designs. Were we to judge from appearances only, we might imagine, that so far from being useful to the earth, the cold humidity of snow would be detrimental to vegetation. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of all ages affords the contrary. Snow, particularly in those northern regions where the ground is covered with it for several months, fertilizes the earth, by guarding the corn or other vegetables from the intenser cold of the air, and especially from the cold piercing winds. It has been a vulgar opinion, very generally received, that snow fertilizes the lands on which it falls more than rain, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the nitrous salts which it is supposed to acquire by freezing. But it appears from the experiments of Margraaf, in the year 1751, that the chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between rain and snow water is exceedingly small; that the latter contains a less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of earth than the former; but neither of them contain either earth or any kind of salt in any quantity which can be sensibly efficacious in promoting vegetation. Allowing, therefore, that nitre is a fertilizer of lands, which many are upon good grounds disposed utterly to deny, yet so very small is the quantity of it contained in snow, that it cannot be supposed to promote the vegetation of plants upon which the snow has fallen. The peculiar agency of snow, as a fertilizer in preference to rain, may admit of a very rational explanation, without recurring to nitrous salts supposed to be contained in it. It may be rationally ascribed to its furnishing a covering to the roots of vegetables, by which they are guarded from the influence of the atmospheric cold, and the internal heat of the earth is prevented from escaping.\n\nThe internal part of the earth, by some principle which we do not understand, is heated uniformly to the 48th degree of Fahrenheit's thermometer. This degree of heat is greater than that in which the watery juices of vegetables freeze, and it is propagated from the inward parts of the earth to the surface, on which the vegetables grow. The atmosphere being variably heated by the action of the sun in different climates, and in the same climate at different seasons, communicates to the surface of the earth and to some distance below it the degree of heat or cold which prevails in itself. Different vegetables are able to preserve life under different degrees of cold, but all of them perish when the cold which reaches their roots is extreme. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> has therefore, in the coldest climates, provided a covering\nof snow for the roots of vegetables, by which they are protected from the influence of the atmospheric cold. The snow keeps in the internal heat of the earth, which surrounds the roots of vegetables, and defends them from the cold of the atmosphere.\n\nSnow or ice water is always deprived of its fixed air, which escapes during the process of congelation. Accordingly, as some of the inhabitants of the Alps who use it for their constant drink have enormous wens upon their throats, it has been ascribed to this circumstance. If this were the cause of these wens, it would be easy to remove it by exposing the snow-water to the air for some time. But several eminent physicians have rejected the notion that snow-water is the cause of these wens; for in Greenland, where snow-water is commonly used, the inhabitants are not affected with such swellings; on the other hand, they are common in Sumatra where snow is never seen.\n\nSnow, in sea-affairs, is generally the largest of all two-masted vessels employed by Europeans, and the most convenient for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>.\n\nThe sails and rigging on the mainmast and foremast of a snow are exactly similar to those on the same masts in a ship; only that there is a small mast behind the mainmast of the former, which carries a sail nearly resembling the mizen of a ship. The root of the mast is fixed on a block of wood on the quarter-deck abaft the mainmast; and the head of it is attached to the after-top of the maintop. The sail which is called the try-sail is extended from its mast towards the stern of the vessel.\n\nWhen the sloops of war are rigged as snows, they are furnished with a horse, which answers the purpose of the try-sail-mast, the fore-part of the sail being attached by rings to the said horse, in different parts of its height.\n\n**Snow-Grotto**, an excavation made by the waters on the side of Mount Etna, by making their way under the layers of lava, and by carrying away the bed of pozzolana below them. It occurred to the proprietor, that this place was very suitable for a magazine of snow; for in Sicily, at Naples, and particularly at Malta, they are obliged for want of ice to make use of snow for cooling their wine, sherbet, and other liquors, and for making sweetmeats.\n\nThis grotto was hired or bought by the knights of Malta, who having neither ice nor snow on the burning rock which they inhabit, have hired several caverns on Etna, into which people whom they employ collect and preserve quantities of snow to be sent to Malta when needed. The grotto has therefore been repaired within at the expense of that order; flights of steps are cut into it, as well as two openings from above, by which they throw in the snow, and through which the grotto is enlightened. Above the grotto they have also levelled a piece of ground of considerable extent; this they have inclosed with thick and lofty walls, so that when the winds, which at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> blow with great violence, carry the snow from the higher parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and deposit it in the inclosure, it is retained and screened by the walls. The people then remove it into the grotto through the two openings; and it is there laid up, and preserved in such a manner as to resist the force of the summer heats; as the layers of lava with which the grotto is arched above prevent them from making any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>.\n\nWhen the season for exporting the snow comes on, it is put into large bags, into which it is pressed as closely as possible; it is then carried by men out of the grotto, and laid upon mules, which convey it to the shore, where small vessels are waiting to carry it away.\n\nBut before those lumps of snow are put into bags, they are wrapped in fresh leaves; so that while they are conveyed from the grotto to the shore, the leaves may prevent the rays of the sun from making any impression upon them.\n\nThe Sicilians carry on a considerable trade in snow, which affords employment to some thousands of mules, horses, and men. They have magazines of it on the summits of their loftiest mountains, from which they distribute it through all their cities, towns, and houses; for every person in the island makes use of snow. They consider the practice of cooling their liquors as absolutely necessary for the preservation of health; and in a climate the heat of which is constantly relaxing the fibres, cooling liquors, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> a proper tone to the fibres of the stomach, must greatly strengthen them for the performance of their functions.\n\nIn this climate a scarcity of snow is no less dreaded than a scarcity of corn, wine, or oil. We are informed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who was at Syracuse in the year 1777, when there was a scarcity of snow, the people of the town learned that a small vessel loaded with that article was passing the coast; without a moment's deliberation they ran in a body to the shore, and demanded her cargo; which when the crew refused to deliver up, the Syracusans attacked and took, though with the loss of several men.\n\n**SNOW-DROP.** See CHIONANTHUS, BOTANY Index.\n\n**SNOWDON HILL,** the name of a mountain in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAERNARVONSHIRE\">Caernarvonshire</a> in Wales, generally thought to be the highest in Britain; though some have been of opinion that its height is equalled, or even exceeded, by mountains in the Highlands of Scotland. The mountain is surrounded by many others, called in the Welsh language Crib Coch, Crib y Ddysil, Llithedd yr Arran, &c.\n\nAccording to Mr Pennant *, this mountainous tract * Journey yields scarcely any corn. Its produce is cattle and sheep; which, during summer, keep very high in the mountains, followed by their owners with their families, who reside during that season in hovels, or \"summer dairy-houses,\" as the farmers in the Swiss Alps do in their fenners. These houses consist of a long low room, with a hole at one end to let out the smoke from the fire which is made beneath. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> is very simple; stones are substituted for stools, and their beds are of hay, ranged along the sides. They manufacture their own clothes, and dye them with the lichen omphalodes and lichen parietinus, mosses collected from the rocks. During summer the men pass their time in tending their herds or in making hay, &c., and the women in milking or in making butter and cheese. For their own use they milk both ewes and goats, and make cheese of the milk. Their diet consists of milk, cheese, and butter; and their ordinary drink is whey; though they have, by way of reserve, a few bottles of very strong beer, which they use as a cordial when sick. They are people of good understanding, wary, and circumspect; tall, thin,\nthin, and of strong constitutions. In the winter-time they descend into the *hen dref*, or \"old dwelling,\" where they pass their time in inactivity.\n\nThe view from the highest peak of Snowdon is very extensive. From it Mr Pennant saw the county of Chester, the high hills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, part of the north of England, Scotland, and Ireland; a plain view of the Isle of Man; and that of Anglesea appeared like a map extended under his feet, with every rivulet visible. Our author took much pains to have this view to advantage; sat up at a farm on the west till about 12, and walked up the whole way. The night was remarkably fine and starry; towards morning the stars faded away, leaving an interval of darkness, which, however, was soon dispelled by the dawn of day. The body of the sun appeared most distinct, with the roundness of the moon, before it appeared too brilliant to be looked at. The sea, which bounded the western part of the prospect, appeared gilt with the sun-beams, first in slender streaks, and at length glowed with redness. The prospect was disclosed like the gradual drawing up of a curtain in a theatre; till at last the heat became sufficiently strong to raise mists from the various lakes, which in a flight degree obscured the prospect. The shadow of the mountain extended many miles, and showed its bicipitated form; the Wyddfa making one head, and Crib y Ddillt the other. At this time he counted between 20 and 30 lakes either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAERNARVON\">Caernarvon</a> or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIONETHSHIRE\">Merionethshire</a>. In making another visit, the sky was obscured very soon after he got up. A vast mist involved the whole circuit of the mountain, and the prospect down was horrible. It gave an idea of numbers of abysses, concealed by a thick smoke furiously circulating around them. Very often a gust of wind made an opening in the clouds, which gave a fine and distinct vista of lake and valley. Sometimes they opened in one place, at others in many at once; exhibiting a most strange and perplexing sight of water, fields, rocks, and chasms. They then closed again, and everything was involved in darkness; in a few minutes they would separate again, and repeat the above-mentioned scene with infinite variety. From this prospect our traveller descended with great reluctance; but before he had reached the place where his horses were left, he was overtaken by a thunderstorm. The rolling of the thunder-claps, being reiterated by the mountains, was inexpressibly awful; and after he had mounted, he was in great danger of being swept away by the torrents which poured down in consequence of a very heavy rain.\n\nIt is very rare (Mr Pennant observes) that the traveller gets a proper day to ascend this hill: it indeed often appears clear; but by the evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the clouds by this lofty mountain, it becomes suddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in mist, when the clouds have just before appeared very high and very remote. At times he observed them lower to half their height; and notwithstanding they have been dispersed to the right and left, yet they have met from both sides, and united to involve the summit in one great obscurity.\n\nThe height of Snowdon was measured, in 1682, by Mr Calwell, with instruments made by Flamstead; according to his measurement, the height is 3720 feet; but more modern computations make it only 3568, reckoning from the quay at Caernarvon to the highest peak. The stone that composes this mountain is excessively hard. Large coarse crystals, and frequently cubic pyrites, are found in the fissures. An immense quantity of water rushes down the sides of Snowdon and the neighbouring mountains, inasmuch that Mr Pennant supposes, if collected into one stream, they would exceed the waters of the Thames.","sp":35,"ep":38},{"h":"SNUFF","t":"a powder chiefly made of tobacco, the use of which is too well known to need any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> here.\n\nTobacco is usually the basis of snuff; other matters being only added to give it a more agreeable scent, &c.

We shall only say, that there are three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> sorts: the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a>; the second an impalpable powder; and the third the bran, or coarse part remaining after sifting the second sort.\n\n\"Every professed, inveterate, and incurable snuff-taker (says Lord Stanhope), at a moderate computation, takes one pinch in ten minutes. Every pinch, with the agreeable ceremony of blowing and wiping the nose and other incidental circumstances, consumes a minute and a half. One minute and a half out of every ten, allowing 16 hours to a snuff-taking day, amounts to two hours and 24 minutes out of every natural day, or one day out of every ten. One day out of every 10 amounts to 36 days and a half in a year. Hence if we suppose the practice to be persisted in 40 years, two entire years of the snuff-taker's life will be dedicated to tickling his nose, and two more to blowing it. The expense of snuff, snuff boxes, and handkerchiefs, will be the subject of a second essay; in which it will appear, that this luxury encroaches as much on the income of the snuff-taker as it does on his time; and that by a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the time and money thus lost to the public, a fund might be constituted for the discharge of the national debt.\" See **<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOTIANA\">NICOTIANA</a>**.","sp":38,"ep":38},{"h":"SNYDERS","t":"FRANCIS**, a Flemish painter, born at Antwerp in 1579, and bred under his countryman Henry Van Balen.

The soap which is used in medicine is made without heat.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> where large quantities of it are prepared, soap is made with heat. A lixivium of quicklime and\nand soda is made, but is less concentrated than that above referred to, and only so much that it can sustain a fresh egg. A part of this lixivium is to be even diluted and mixed with an equal weight of oil of olives. The mixture is to be put on a gentle fire, and agitated, that the union may be accelerated. When the mixture begins to unite well, the rest of the lixivium is to be added to it; and the whole is to be digested with a very gentle heat, till the soap be completely made. A trial is to be made of it, to examine whether the just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of oil and alkali has been observed. Good soap of this kind ought to be firm, and very white when cold; not subject to become mottled by exposure to air, and entirely miscible with pure water, to which it communicates a milky appearance, but without any drops of oil floating on the surface. When the soap has not these qualities, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> has not been well made, or the quantity of fat or oil is too great, which faults must be corrected.\n\nIn soft or liquid soaps, green or black soaps, cheaper oils are employed, as oil of nuts, of hemp, of fish, &c. These soaps, excepting in consistence, are not essentially different from white soap.\n\nFixed alkalies are much disposed to unite with oils that are not volatile, both vegetable and animal, since this union can be made even without heat. The compound resulting from this union partakes at the same time of the properties of oil and of alkali; but these properties are modified and tempered by each other, according to the general rule of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>. Alkali formed into soap has not nearly the same acrimony as when it is pure; it is even deprived of almost all its causticity, and its other saline alkaline properties are almost entirely abolished. The same oil contained in soap is less combustible than when pure, from its union with the alkali, which is an uninflammable body. It is miscible, or even soluble, in water, to a certain degree, by means of the alkali. Soap is entirely soluble in spirit of wine; and still better in aquavitae sharpened by a little alkaline salt, according to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of Mr Geoffrey.\n\nThe manufacture of soap in London first began in the year 1524; before which time this city was served with white soap from foreign countries, and with gray soap speckled with white from Bristol, which was sold for a penny a pound; and also with black soap, which sold for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALFPENNY\">halfpenny</a> the pound.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> soaps of our own manufacture are the soft, the hard, and the ball soap. The soft soap is either white or green. The process of making each of these shall now be described.\n\n**Green soft soap.** The chief ingredients used in making this are lees drawn from pot-ash and lime, boiled up with tallow and oil. First, the ley of a proper degree of strength (which must be estimated by the weight of the liquor), and tallow, are put into the copper together, and as soon as they boil up the oil is added; the fire is then damped or stopped up, while the ingredients remain in the copper to unite; when they are united, the copper is again made to boil, being fed or filled with lees as it boils, till there be a sufficient quantity put into it; then it is boiled off and put into casks. When this soap is first made it appears uniform; but in about a week's time the tallow separates from the oil into those white grains which we see in common soap. Soap thus made would appear yellow, but by a mixture of indigo added at the end of the boiling, it is rendered green, that being the colour which results from the mixture of yellow and blue.\n\n**White soap.** Of this one sort is made after the same manner as green soft soap, oil alone excepted, which is not used in white. The other sort of white soft soap is made from the lees of ashes of lime boiled up two different times with tallow. First, a quantity of lees and tallow are put into the copper together, and kept boiling, being fed with lees as they boil, until the whole is boiled sufficiently; then the lees are separated or discharged from the tallowish part, which part is removed into a tub, and the lees are thrown away; this is called the first half-boil; then the copper is filled again with fresh tallow and lees, and the first half-boil is put out of the tub into the copper a second time, where it is kept boiling with fresh lees and tallow till the soap is produced. It is then put out of the copper into the same sort of casks as are used for green soft soap. The common soft soap used about London, generally of a greenish hue, with some white lumps, is prepared chiefly with tallow: a blackish sort, more common in some other places, is said to be made with whale oil.\n\n**Hard soap** is made with lees from ashes and tallow, and is most commonly boiled twice: the first, called the half-boil, hath the same operation as the first half-boil of soft white soap. Then the copper is charged with fresh lees again, and the first half boil put into it, where it is kept boiling, and fed with lees as it boils, till it grains or is boiled enough: then the ley is discharged from it, and the soap put into a frame to cool and harden. Common salt is made use of for the purpose of graining the soap; for when the oil or tallow has been united with the ley, after a little boiling, a quantity of salt is thrown into the mass, which dissolving readily in water, but not in the oil or tallow, draws out the water in a considerable degree, so that the oil or tallow united with the salt of the ley swims on the top. When the ley is of a proper strength, less salt is necessary to raise the curd than when it is too weak. It must be observed, that there is no certain time for bringing off a boiling of any of these sorts of soap: it frequently takes up part of two days.\n\n**Ball soap,** commonly used in the north, is made with lees from ashes and tallow. The lees are put into the copper, and boiled till the watery part is quite gone, and there remains nothing in the copper but a sort of fain matter (the very strength or essence of the ley); to this the tallow is put, and the copper is kept boiling and stirring for above half an hour, in which time the soap is made; and then it is put out of the copper into tubs or baskets with sheets in them, and immediately (whilst soft) made into balls. It requires near 24 hours in this process to boil away the watery part of the ley.\n\nWhen oil unites with alkali in the formation of soap, it is little altered in the connection of its principles; for it may be separated from the alkali by decomposing soap with any acid, and may be obtained nearly in its original state.","sp":38,"ep":39},{"h":"SOCAGE","t":"in its most general and extensive signification, seems to denote a tenure by any certain and determinate service. And in this sense it is by our ancient writers constantly put in opposition to chivalry or knight-service, where the render was precarious and uncertain. The service must therefore be certain, in order to denominate it socage; as to hold by fealty and 20s. rent; or, by homage, fealty, and 20s. rent; or, by homage and fealty without rent; or, by fealty and certain corporal service, as ploughing the lord's land for three days; or, by fealty only without any other service: for all these are tenures in socage.\n\nSocage is of two sorts: free-socage, where the services are not only certain but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>; and villein-socage, where the services, though certain, are of a baser nature (see VILLENAGE). Such as hold by the former tenure are called, in Glanvil and other subsequent authors, by the name of liberti socomanni, or tenants in free-socage. The word is derived from the Saxon appellation soc, which signifies liberty or privilege; and, being joined to an usual termination, is called socage, in Latin socagium; signifying thereby a free or privileged tenure.\n\nIt seems probable that the socage-tenures were the relics of Saxon liberty; retained by such persons as had neither forfeited them to the king, nor been obliged to exchange their tenure for the more honourable, as it was called, but at the same time more burdensome, tenure of knight-service. This is peculiarly remarkable in the tenure which prevails in Kent, called gavelkind, which is generally acknowledged to be a species of socage-tenure; the preservation whereof inviolate from the innovations of the Norman conqueror is a fact universally known. And those who thus preserved their liberties were said to hold in free and common socage.\n\nAs therefore the grand criterion and distinguishing mark of this species of tenure are the having its renders or services ascertained, it will include under it all other methods of holding free lands by certain and invariable rents and duties; and in particular, Petit SERJEANTY, Tenure in BURGAGE, and GAVELKIND. See these articles.","sp":41,"ep":41},{"h":"SOCIETIES","t":"associations voluntarily formed by a number of individuals for promoting knowledge, industry, or virtue. They may therefore be divided into three classes; societies for promoting science and literature, societies for encouraging and promoting arts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and societies for diffusing religion and morality and relieving distress. Societies belonging to the first class extend their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to all the sciences and literature in general, or devote it to one particular science. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> may be applied to those which are instituted for improving arts and manufactures. Those of the third class are established, either with a view to prevent crimes, as the Philanthropic Society; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the Christian religion among unenlightened nations, as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts; or for introducing arts and civilization, along with a knowledge of the Christian religion, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIERRA_LEONE\">Sierra Leone</a> company.\n\nThe honour of planning and instituting societies for those valuable purposes is due to modern times. A literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> is said to have been formed in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a> (see Academy); but the plan seems to have been rude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. Several others were instituted in Italy in the 16th century; but from the accounts which we have seen of them, they seem to have been far inferior to those which are most flourishing at present. The most enlarged idea of literary societies seems to have originated with the great Lord Bacon, the father of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, who recommended to the reigning prince to institute societies of learned men, who should give to the world from time to time a regular account of their researches and discoveries. It was the idea of this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, that the learned world should be united, as it were, into one immense republic; which, though consisting of many detached states, should hold a strict union and preserve a mutual intelligence with each other, in every thing that regards the common interest. The want of this union and intelligence he laments as one of the chief obstacles to the advancement of science; and, justly considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of public societies, in the different countries of Europe, under the auspices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, to be the best remedy for that defect, he has given, in his fanciful work, the New Atlantis, the delineation of a philosophical society on the most extended plan, for the improvement of all arts and sciences; a work which, though written in the language, and tinged with the colouring of romance, is full of the noblest philosophic views. The plan of Lord Bacon, which met with little attention from the age in which he lived, was destined to produce its effect in a period not very distant. The scheme of a philosophical college by Cowley is acknowledged to have had a powerful influence in procuring the establishment of the Royal Society of London by charter from Charles II.; and Cowley's plan is manifestly copied in almost all its parts from that in the New Atlantis. The institution of the Royal Society of London was soon followed by the establishment of the Royal Academy.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> demy of Sciences at Paris; and these two have served as models to the philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> of highest reputation in the other kingdoms of Europe.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of ages has shown, that improvements of a public nature are best carried on by societies of liberal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> men, uniting their labours without regard to nation, sect, or party, in one grand pursuit alike interesting to all, whereby mutual prejudices are worn off, and a humane philosophical spirit is cherished. Men united together, and frequently meeting for the purpose of advancing the sciences, the arts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, manufactures, and commerce, may oftentimes suggest such hints to one another as may be improved to important ends; and such societies, by being the repositories of the observations and discoveries of the learned and ingenious, may from time to time furnish the world with useful publications which might otherwise be lost: for men of ingenuity and modesty may not choose to risk their reputation, by sending abroad unpatronized what a learned society might judge richly worth the public eye; or perhaps their circumstances being straitened, they may not be able to defray the expense of publication. Societies instituted for promoting knowledge may also be of eminent service, by exciting a spirit of emulation, and by kindling those sparks of genius which otherwise might for ever have been concealed; and if, when possessed of funds sufficient for the purpose, they reward the exertions of the industrious and enterprising with pecuniary premiums or honorary medals, many important experiments and useful discoveries will be made, from which the public may reap the highest advantages.\n\nEminent instances of the beneficial effects of such institutions we have in the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, the Royal Society, and the Society instituted for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, in London, and many others of a similar kind. Hereby a spirit of discovery and improvement has been excited among the ingenious in almost every nation; knowledge of various kinds, and greatly useful to mankind, has taken place of the dry and uninteresting speculations of schoolmen; and bold and erroneous hypotheses has been obliged to give way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATIVE\">demonstrative</a> experiment. In short, since the establishment of these societies, solid learning and philosophy have more increased than they had done for many centuries before.\n\nAs to those societies established for promoting industry, religion and morality, and relieving distress, the design is laudable and excellent, and presents a beautiful picture of the philanthropy of modern times. We are happy to find, from the minutes of some of these societies, that their beneficial effects are already conspicuous.\n\nWe will now give some account of the most eminent societies; arranging them under the three classes into which we have divided them: I. Religious and Humane Societies. II. Societies for Promoting Science and Literature. III. Societies for Encouraging Arts, Manufactures, &c.\n\nI. RELIGIOUS AND HUMANE SOCIETIES.\n\n1. Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, was instituted by King William III. in 1701, in order to secure a maintenance for an orthodox clergy, and to make other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for propagating the gospel in the plantations, colonies, and factories beyond the seas. To that end he incorporated the archbishops, several of the bishops, and others of the nobility, gentry, and clergy, to the number of 90, into one body, which, by the name of The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, was to plead and be implicated; to have perpetual succession, with privilege to purchase 2000l. a-year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>, and estates for lives or years, with other goods and chattels to any value. By its charter the society is authorized to use a common seal; and to meet annually on the third Friday in February for the purpose of choosing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, vice-president, and officers for the year ensuing; and on the third Friday in every month, or oftener if there should be occasion, to transact business, and to depute persons to take subscriptions, and collect money contributed for the purposes aforesaid; and of all moneys received and laid out, it is obliged to give account yearly to the lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> or keeper, the lord-chief-justice of the King's-bench, the lord-chief-justice of the Common-pleas, or to any two of these magistrates. Of this society there is a standing committee at St Paul's chapter-house, to prepare matters for the monthly meeting, which is held at St Martin's library.\n\nBefore the incorporation of the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts, there had been formed, for the promoting of Christian knowledge both at home and in the colonies, a voluntary association of persons of rank and respectability, who in March 1699 began to hold stated meetings in London for that purpose, regulating themselves by the laws of the land and the canons of the church; and when the new society was formed, they had already transmitted to America and the West Indies 800l. worth of Bibles, Books of Common Prayer, and treatises of practical religion, besides securing a tolerable maintenance to several clergymen on that continent. This association still fulfils under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and has been productive of much good in the cities of London and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>; but upon the formation of the new society, into which all its original members were incorporated by name, the care which the voluntary association had taken of the colonies devolved of course upon the incorporated society; of which incorporation we believe the object has been sometimes mistaken, and the labours of its missionaries grossly misrepresented. It has by many been supposed that the society was incorporated for the sole purpose of converting the savage Americans; and it has been much blamed for sending missionaries into provinces where, in the common language of the complainers, a gospel-ministry was already established. But an impartial view of the rise and progress of the American provinces, now become independent states, will show the folly and injustice of those complaints.\n\nThe English colonies in North America were in the last century formed and first peopled by religious men; who, made uneasy at home by their intolerant brethren, left the old world to enjoy in peace that first and chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of man, the free worship of God according to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. At one time Puritans were driven across the Atlantic by the episcopal church; at another, Churchmen were forced away by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESBYTERIANS\">presbyterians</a>, just as the revolutions of state threw the civil power into the hands of the one or the other party; and not a few\nmembers of the CHURCH OF ROME were chafed to the wilds of America by the united exertions of both. It has been often observed, that people persecuted for their religion become for the most part enthusiastically attached to it; and the conduct of those colonists was in perfect harmony with this observation. Their zeal, inflamed by their violent removal to the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>, kept religion alive and active among themselves; but their poverty disabled them from supplying fuel to the flame, by making provision for a ministry to instruct their offspring. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that the new Christian commonwealth, without the kindly assistance of its mother-country, would have been, in the words of the Roman historian, Res unius estatis. Against this danger a timely aid was to be provided by the society; which, as it consisted not of fanatical members, would not intrude the important business of the mission to fanatical preachers, who, though always ready for such spiritual enterprises, are never qualified to carry them on with success.\n\nIt was therefore thought fit to assign a decent maintenance for clergymen of the church of England, who might preach the gospel to their brethren in America: and though those missionaries in general carefully avoided the conduct of those of Rome, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> aim is to reduce all churches under submission to the papal tyranny; yet so lately as 1765, did some of the colonies, in which the puritanic spirit of the last century characterized the church established by law, raise a hideous outcry against the society for sending a mission into their quarters, though only for the service of the dispersed members of the Episcopal church residing among them, and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of those men whom their rigid fanaticism had prejudiced against Christianity itself.\n\nIndeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> called FREETHINKING, as Bishop Warburton expresses it, was at an early period imported by the opulent and fashionable colonists. The celebrated Berkeley, who had resided some years in Rhode Island, and at his return was called upon to preach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNIVERSARY\">anniversary</a> sermon before the society, informs us, that the island where he lived was inhabited by an English colony, consisting chiefly of sectaries of many different denominations; that several of the better sort of the inhabitants of towns were accustomed to assemble themselves regularly on the Lord's day for the performance of divine worship; but that most of those who were dispersed through the colony rivalled some well-bred people of other countries, in a thorough indifference for all that is sacred, being equally careless of outward worship and of inward principles. He adds, that the missionaries had done, and were continuing to do, good service in bringing those planters to a serious sense of religion. \"I speak it knowingly (says he), that the ministers of the gospel, in those provinces which go by the name of New England, sent and supported at the expense of the society, have, by their sobriety of manners, discreet behaviour, and a competent degree of useful knowledge, shown themselves worthy of the choice of those who sent them.\" We have the honour to be acquainted with some of the missionaries sent at a later period, and have reason to believe that, down to the era of the American revolution, they had the same virtues, and were doing the same good services, which procured to their predecessors this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> testimony from one of the greatest and the best of men. Surely such a mission deserved not to be evil spoken of by sectaries of any denomination who believe in Christ; especially as the very charter of incorporation affirms as a reason for missionaries being sent to the colonies, \"that by reason of their poverty those colonies were destitute and unprovided of a MAINTENANCE for ministers and the public worship of God.\"\n\nThe society, however, was incorporated for other purposes than this. It was obliged by its charter to attempt the conversion of the native Americans and the negro slaves; and we have reason to believe, that, as soon as the spiritual wants of the colonists were decently supplied, it was not inattentive to these glorious objects. Its success indeed in either pursuit has not been to great as could be wished; but it would be rash and unfair to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> this failure to the president, vice-president, or other officers of the corporation at home. An erroneous notion, that the being baptized is insufficient with a state of slavery, rendered the selfish colonists for a long time averse from the conversion of their negroes, and made them throw every obstacle in the way of all who made the attempt; while the difficulties of the Indian mission are such as hardly any clergyman educated in a Protestant country can be supposed able to surmount.\n\nHe who hopes successfully to preach the gospel among a tribe of savage wanderers, must have an ardent zeal and unrestrained diligence; appetites subdued to all the distresses of want; and a mind superior to all the terrors of mortality. These qualities and habits may be acquired in the church of Rome by him who from infancy has been trained up in the severities of some of the monastic orders, and afterwards sent to the college de propaganda fide to be instructed in the languages, and inured to the manners and customs, of the barbarous nations whose conversion he is destined to attempt. But in the reformed churches of Britain there are no monastic orders, nor any college de propaganda fide; and yet without the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, which is to be looked for in such institutions alone, it is not in nature, whatever grace may effect, for any man cheerfully, and at the same time soberly, to undergo all the accumulated distresses ever ready to overtake a faithful missionary among savage idolaters. A fanatic zealot will indeed undertake it, though he is totally unqualified for every sober and important work; and a man of ruined fortunes may be pressed into the service, though the impotency of his mind has thrown him unable to bear either poverty or riches. The failure of the society therefore in its attempts to convert the American Indians may be attributed, we think, in the first instance, to the want of a college de propaganda for training up young men for the American mission.\n\nPerhaps another cause of this failure may be found in the conduct of the missionaries, who, it is to be presumed, have not always employed in a proper manner even the scanty qualifications which they actually possessed. The gospel, plain and simple as it is, and fitted in its nature for what it was ordained to effect, cannot be apprehended but by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> somewhat raised above that of a savage. Such of the missionaries therefore as began their work with preaching to savage and brutal men, certainly set out at the wrong end; for to make the gospel understood, and much more to propa-\ngate and establish it, those savages should have been first taught the necessary arts of civil life, which, while they improve every bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, tend at the same time to enlarge and enlighten the understanding. For want of this previous culture, we doubt not, it hath happened that such of the savages as have been baptized into the faith have so seldom persevered themselves, or been able in any degree to propagate among their tribes the Christianity which they had been taught, and that successive missions have always found it necessary to begin anew the work of conversion.\n\nTo one or other of these causes, or to both, may justly be attributed the little progress which reformed Christianity has made among the Indians of North America; and not to any want of zeal, attention, or liberality, in the directors of the society at home. During the dependence of the United States on the mother-country, great part of the society's funds was properly expended in keeping alive a just sense of religion among the Christian colonists from Europe, who had surely the first claims upon this best of charities; but now that America has separated herself from Great Britain, and shown that she is able to maintain her independence, and to make ample provision for a regular clergy of her own, the members of the corporation must feel themselves at liberty to bestow greater attention, and to expend more money than they could formerly do, on the conversion of such Indians as have any intercourse with the settlements which we still possess. To a body so respectable, we presume not to offer advice; but we cannot help thinking, with Bishop Berkeley, that the most successful missionaries would be children of Indians, educated in a considerable number together from the age of ten or twelve in a college de propaganda fide, where they should be in no danger of losing their mother-tongue while they were acquiring a competent knowledge of religion, morality, history, practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, and agriculture. \"If there were a yearly supply (says he) of a dozen such missionaries sent abroad into their respective countries, after they had received the degree of master of arts, and been admitted into holy orders, it is hardly to be doubted but that in a little time the world would see good and great effects of their mission.\"\n\n2. Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge, was instituted in the beginning of the eighteenth century. At that period the condition of the Scotch Highlanders was truly deplorable. Shut up in desolate islands by tempestuous seas, or dispersed over a wide extent of country, intersected by high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, rapid rivers, and arms of the sea, without bridges or highways, by which any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> could be kept open either with remote or neighbouring districts, they lived in small detached companies in hamlets or solitary huts. Being thus secluded from intercourse with the more civilized part of the island, they could not enjoy the advantages of trade and manufactures.

We are sorry to add, that even in the present enlightened and benevolent age the complaint is not entirely removed.\n\n(B) The feudal system was at length abolished in the year 1748 by the jurisdiction act.\nledge in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and in foreign parts of the world.\" Copies of these proposals, with subscription papers, were distributed through the kingdom; and the contributions having soon amounted to \u00a31000, her majesty Queen Anne encouraged this infant society by her royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, and at the same time issued letters patent under the great seal of Scotland for erecting certain of the subscribers into a corporation; the first nomination of whom was lodged with the lords of council and secession.\n\nThis corporation held its first meeting on Thursday 2nd November 1709. It was attended by several of the nobility, fourteen of the lords of secession, many gentlemen of rank, together with most of the ministers of the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> and neighbourhood. A president, secretary, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, with a committee of fifteen directors, were appointed for the dispatch of business. At their second meeting in January 1710, a scheme of management was formed and approved; in which it was proposed, 1. To erect and maintain schools in such places of Scotland, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, as should be found to need them most; in which schools all persons whatsoever should be taught by fit and well qualified schoolmasters, appointed by the society, to read the Holy Scriptures and other pious books; as also to write, and to understand the common rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, with such other things as should be thought suitable to their circumstances. 2. That the schoolmasters should be particularly careful to instruct their scholars in the principles of the Christian reformed religion; and for that end should be obliged to catechise them at least twice a week, and to pray publicly with them twice a day. 3. That not only such as were unable to pay should be taught gratis, but that those whose circumstances required it, should have such farther encouragement as the society should think fit in a consistency with their patent. 4. To name some prudent persons, ministers and others, to be overseers of those schools, who should take care that the schoolmasters do their duty, and that the instructions to be given from time to time by the society or their committee be punctually observed; which overseers should make their report to the society quarterly or half-yearly at farthest. 5. To give suitable encouragement to such ministers or catechists as should be willing to contribute their assistance towards the farther instruction of the scholars remote from church, by not only catechising, but preaching to them; which ministers or catechists should take the same care of the other inhabitants as of the scholars. 6. To extend their endeavours for the advancement of the Christian religion to heathen nations; and for that end to give encouragement to ministers to preach the gospel among them.\n\nHaving thus formed a plan, they immediately proceeded to establish schools in the most useful and economical manner; and as the capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to accumulate, the interest was faithfully applied, and the utility of the institution was more extensively diffused.\n\nUntil the year 1738 the attention of the society had been wholly directed to the establishment of schools; but their capital being then considerably augmented, they began to extend their views of utility much farther. The grand object of all public associations ought certainly to be the promoting of religion and morality. It must, however, be evident to every man of reflection, that these can neither be propagated nor preserved among a people without agriculture, unaccustomed to commerce and manufactures, and consequently without labour or exertion. Languor and debility of mind must always be the companions of idleness. While the Highlanders roved about with arms in their hands, the latent vigour of their minds must often have been called forth into action; but when their arms were taken away, and themselves confined to a domestic life, where there was nothing to rouse their minds, they must have sunk into indolence and inactivity. All attempts therefore to instruct them in religion and morality, without introducing among them some of the necessary arts of life, would probably have been unavailing. The society accordingly resolved to adopt what appeared to them the most effectual methods of introducing industry among the Highlanders. But as their patent did not extend far enough, they applied to his majesty George II. for an enlargement of their powers; and accordingly obtained a second patent, by which they are empowered, \"besides fulfilling the purposes of their original patent, to cause such of the children as they shall think fit to be bred to husbandry and housewifery, to trades and manufactures, or in such manual occupations as the society shall think proper.\"\n\nThe objects of this second patent the society have not failed to pursue; and though many obstructions and discouragements to their efforts occurred among a rude and barbarous people, yet their perseverance, and the obvious utility of their plans, at length so far overcame the reluctance of the inhabitants, that not fewer than 94 schools of industry in various parts of the Highlands and Islands are now upon their establishment, at which are educated 2360 scholars.\n\nThe society, while anxiously endeavouring to diffuse a spirit of industry through the Highlands, were still equally solicitous to promote the knowledge of the Christian religion. As the English language had been the only channel by which knowledge was conveyed to them (a language which, being not used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, was in all respects foreign to them), it was judged requisite that they should have the Scriptures in their vernacular tongue. The society therefore first appointed a translation of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> to be made into Gaelic; A translation was accordingly undertaken by the Rev. Mr Stewart minister of Killin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol6.html#article-PERTHSHIRE\">Perthshire</a>, and printed in 1767, which is said to be executed with much fidelity. Of this work many thousand copies have been distributed in the Highlands. The greater part of the Old Testament has also been translated by the Rev. Dr Smith of Campbellton and others, but chiefly by the Rev. Dr Stewart of Lufts, by the appointment and at the expense of the society: and as soon as the remaining part can be got ready, the whole will be sold at a low price as the poor may without difficulty afford. This plan the society have judiciously chosen, in order to prevent discontent and murmuring; effects which the diffusion of the Scriptures ought never to produce; but which could not possibly have been prevented, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> been gratuitous, and of course partial.\n\nFor some years past the funds of the society have rapidly\npidly accumulated, from the very liberal donations of several individuals.\n\nLady Glenorchy - L. 5,000\nBy a person unknown - 10,000\nLord Van Vryhouven of Holland - 20,000\nMrs Gray of Teasles - 3,500\n\nIn consequence of these great additions to their stock, infusions have been thrown out that the society have become so wealthy as to be at a loss for proper objects on which to bestow their increased revenue. If such an opinion be seriously entertained by any one, we must beg him to remember, that the society have erected and endowed not fewer than 323 schools for religion, the first principles of literature and industry, at the annual expense of \u00a3214l. 10s. sterling; and that at these seminaries are educated from 14,000 to 15,000 children; who, but for the means of instruction thus obtained, would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> be bred up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and idleness: That they employ 12 missionary ministers and catechists in remote parts of the Highlands and islands, or among the ignorant Highlanders settled in the great towns of Scotland, at the annual expense of \u00a396l.; That they bestow a bursary or pension of \u00a315l. per annum on each of six students of divinity having the Gaelic language: That they employ two missionary ministers and one schoolmaster among the Oneida and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKBRIDGE\">Stockbridge</a> Indians of North America (being the destination of certain legacies bequeathed to them for that purpose), at the annual expense of \u00a340l. Such is their fixed scheme of annual expenditure, amounting in all to \u00a3740l. 10s. sterling\u2014a sum it will be acknowledged of very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>. The whole of their incidental expenses arising from the Gaelic translation of the Scriptures of the Old Testament; from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a> which they have to pay, in consequence of sums left them as residuary legatees; from land and house taxes; from enabling candidates for the office of schoolmaster to come to Edinburgh for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>; from furnishing books to poor scholars in their various schools; and from removing schoolmasters from one station to another, is generally about \u00a3875l., which added to the former sum makes the whole annual expense amount to \u00a3461l. 10s.\n\nIf it be inquired at what expense, in the management of it, this extensive and complicated charity is annually conducted, we are authorised to say, that the treasurer, bookholder, and clerk, are allowed each \u00a32l. per annum, the same salaries which were annexed to these offices from the commencement of the society. The head or officer is allowed \u00a32l. per annum. No salary whatever is enjoyed by any of the other officers of the society. The secretary, comptroller, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNTANT\">accountant</a>, and librarian, although subjected, some of them especially, to no small expense of time and labour, have no pecuniary recompense or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>. Theirs are labours of love, for which they seek and expect no other reward than the conscientiousness of endeavouring to promote the best interests of mankind. The whole amount of the expense of managing the business of the society, including the above salaries, and coals, candle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> ware, postage, and other incidents, exceeds not at an average \u00a311l. per annum. From this statement it appears, that hitherto at least the directors have been at no loss for important objects within the proper sphere of their institution on which to bestow their increased funds. They have, it is true, the disposal of very considerable sums for promoting the objects of the institution; but they are so far from accumulating wealth, that every year their expenditure, notwithstanding the late increase of their capital, exceeds rather than falls short of their income. They have depended upon a kind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> and a generous public to refund these anticipations of their revenue, and hitherto they have never been disappointed.\n\nThus has the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge proceeded for almost a century. It was founded by the pious exertions of a few private individuals, whose names are unknown to the world; and its funds, by faithful and judicious management, as well as by generous contributions, have now become of such magnitude, as to excite the hope that they will be productive of the most valuable effects. The benefits arising from public societies, it is well known, depend entirely upon the management of their directors. If so, the advantages which have accrued from this society entitle it to the praise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of the nation. While eager to increase the number of schools, the society have not been inattentive to their prosperity. In the year 1771 Mr Lewis Drummond, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in whom they placed great confidence, was commissioned by them to visit their schools, and to make an exact report of their state and circumstances. Again, in the year 1790, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> was granted to the Rev. Dr Kemp, one of the ministers of Edinburgh and secretary to the society, to visit all the schools on their establishment. This laborious and gratuitous task he accomplished in the course of four summers with much ability and care, and highly to the satisfaction of the society. At his return he communicated a variety of important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> respecting the state of the Highlands and Islands, and the means necessary for their improvement in religion, literature, and industry; an abstract of which was published by the society in appendices to the anniversary sermons preached before them in the years 1789, 90, 91, and 92.\n\nThe following table will exhibit at a glance the funds, establishment, and expenditure, of the society, from a few years after its commencement to the present time.\n\n---\n\n(C) It is well known, that the number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a> in the Highlands is considerable; but it must give much pleasure to the Protestant reader to be informed, that the ancient malignant spirit of Popery has in that district given place to mildness and liberality. This is chiefly owing to the gentleman who superintends the priests in that quarter, whose mind is enlightened by science and learning. So far from being hostile to the views of the society, he recommended to his clergy to promote them. They accordingly received the secretary with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>; exhorted the people to send their children to the Protestant schools to be instructed in literature, to be taught to read the Scriptures in their own language, and to be made acquainted with those great principles of religion in which all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> are agreed. What a blest reformation!\nWhere the number of scholars is not mentioned, the defect may be supplied by taking an average from those years where a computation has been made. Where the capital is not mentioned, it may easily be made out by considering the salaries as the interest.\n\n| A.D. | Capital | Schools | Scholars |\n|------|---------|---------|----------|\n| 1713 |         | 12      |          |\n| 1715 | L. 6,177| 25      |          |\n| 1719 | 8,168   | 48      |          |\n| 1727 | 9,131   | 78      | 2757     |\n| 1732 | 13,318  | 109     |          |\n| 1742 | 19,287  | 128     |          |\n| 1753 | 24,328  | 152     |          |\n| 1758 | 28,413  | 176     | 6,409    |\n| 1781 | 34,000  | 180     | 7,000    |\n\nSalaries\n\n|       |         |         |          |\n|-------|---------|---------|----------|\n| 1793  | 3,080   | 307     | 12,913   |\n| 1794  | 3,214   | 323     | 14,370   |\n\nHitherto we have taken no notice of the corresponding board which was established at London so early as the year 1729, to receive subscriptions and lay out sums. That board indeed remained long inactive; but in 1773 its members began to co-operate more cordially with their brethren in Scotland. Since that period an annual sermon has been preached in recommendation of the charity; and the preacher is now selected without any regard to the religious denomination to which he belongs; sometimes from the church of England, sometimes from the church of Scotland, and sometimes from lectaries of different persuasions. The meetings of the correspondent board have been attended by many of the nobility and gentry, who have made great exertions to promote the views of the society. From its present flourishing state therefore from the indefatigable exertion and laudable zeal of the managers, and from the countenance and support which they have received from persons of the first rank and respectability in the nation, the benevolent mind may look forward with much confidence and satisfaction to a period not very distant, when its beneficial effects shall be felt not only in the Highlands, but shall be communicated to the rest of the nation. We have been thus particular in our account of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, because we have had access to the most authentic sources of information, and because we know it to be an institution calculated to enlighten and improve a considerable part of the British nation.\n\n3. Society of the Sons of the Clergy, was incorporated by King Charles II. in 1678, by the name of The Governors of the Charity for Relief of the Poor Widows and Children of Clergymen. This society is under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> and management of a president and vice-president, three treasurers, and a court of assistants composed of forty members. Several hundreds of widows and children of the clergy have annually received considerable relief from this useful charity.\n\n4. Society for the Sons of the Clergy of the Established Church of Scotland, was instituted at Edinburgh in February 1790, and was constituted a body corporate by his majesty's royal charter in 1792. The society, after several meetings, are of opinion, that the period in which the families of clergymen feel most urgently the need both of friends and of pecuniary aid, is that which commences with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of the sons either to an university or to business, and terminates with their establishment in their respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>; that many of the ministers of this church, living at great distances from the seats either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> or of business, possess incomes which, in the present state of the country, are inadequate to the purposes of procuring for their sons either the literary or professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> which might enable them to come forward with credit and success in the world; that the sons of clergymen, from domestic tuition and example, have in general very advantageous means of receiving in their early years the impressions of virtue and honour, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of liberal knowledge; and that of course the public interest may be promoted, by enabling this class of young men to obtain their share in the respectable situations of life. The views of the society have been limited to the sons only of clergymen; as they are of opinion, that within the limits which they have fixed, the field of beneficence will be still very extensive, and the claims for aid as many and as great as their funds can be supposed able to answer, at least for many years to come. If the society shall ever be in a situation to undertake more than the aids which will be necessary in bringing forward the sons of the clergy, it may then be considered in what manner the daughters also may become sharers in its bounty.\n\nA society of the same nature, and having the same objects in view, was instituted at Glasgow we think the year before; and both societies, we know, have in many cases proved highly beneficial in promoting the views for which they were instituted.\n\n5. Royal Humane Society, was instituted in London in 1774, for the recovery of persons drowned or otherwise suffocated. We have already given some account of societies instituted in other countries with the same views, and have also copied the directions of this society for the recovery of life, for which see the article DROWNING. We have therefore only to state, that the plan of this society is so adverse to any private interested views, that it acquires its founders of all forbid motives. For the medical practitioners accept no pecuniary recompense for the time which they devote to a difficult and tedious process; for the anxiety which they feel while the event is doubtful; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> which they too often undergo, when death, in spite of all their efforts, at last carries off their prey; nor for the insults to which they willingly expose themselves from vulgar incredulity. Their sole reward is in the holy joy of doing good. Of an institution thus free in its origin from the taintion of ambitious views, and in its plan renouncing self-interest in every shape, philanthropy must be the only basis. The good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> therefore of the society is proved by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; the wisdom and utility of the undertaking are proved by its success: not fewer than 3000 fellow-creatures having since its commencement been (1794) restored to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> by its timely and indefatigable exertions. For it is to be observed, that the benefit of this society is by no means confined to the two cases of drowning and suffocation. Its timely succours have routed the lethargy of opium taken in immoderate and repeated doses; they have rescued the wretched victims of intoxication; rekindled the life extinguished by the sudden stroke of lightning; recovered the apoplectic; restored life to the infant that had lost it in the birth; they have proved efficacious\nefficacious in cases of accidental smothering and of suffocation by noxious damps; in instances in which the tenderest of the infant body or the debility of old age greatly lessened the previous probability of succels: in much that no species of death seems to be placed beyond the reach of this society's affluence, where the mischief had gone no farther than an obstruction of the movements of the animal machine without any damage of the organs themselves. In consequence of every necessary affluence afforded by this society, similar institutions have been established at Algiers, Lisbon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, Boston, Jamaica, Dublin, Leith, Glasgow, Paisley, Aberdeen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, Bristol, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITEHAVEN\">Whitehaven</a>, Norwich, Exeter, Kent, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>. The society has published an 8vo volume with plates, containing of cases, correspondence, and a variety of interesting matter relating to the object of this benevolent institution.\n\n6. The Philanthropic Society, was instituted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1758. It aims at the prevention of crimes, by removing out of the way of evil counsel, and evil company, those children who are, in the present state of things, destined to ruin. It proposes to educate and instruct in some useful trade or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> the children of convicts or other infant poor who are engaged in vagrant or criminal courses; thus to break the chain of those pernicious confederacies, deprive the wicked of successors, the goals of inhabitants, justice of its victims, and by all these means add citizens to society. This institution is not only calculated to decrease vice and infamy, but to increase useful industry; so that those children who would otherwise succeed to their parents <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> crimes, and become the next race of beggars and thieves, will now be taught to supply by honest means their own wants and the wants of others.\n\nTo carry into effect these desirable purposes, it is the first business of the society to select from prisons, and from the haunts of vice, profligacy, and beggary, such objects as appear most likely to become obnoxious to the laws, or prejudicial to the community; and, in the execution of this duty, the affluence of the magistrates, the clergy, and all who are interested in the promotion of good morals and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, is most earnestly requested. For the employment of the children, several houses are supported, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> Heath, near Hackney, in each of which a master-workman is placed for the purpose of teaching the children some useful trade. The trades already established are those of a printer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTER\">carpenter</a>, shoemaker, and taylor. The girls are at present educated as menial servants.\n\nIn the year 1791 not fewer than 70 children were under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of this society, among whom were many who have been guilty of various felonies, burglaries, and other crimes. Yet, singular as it may appear, in less than two years those very children became no less remarkable for industry, activity, decency, and obedience, than they formerly were for the contrary vices. Such are the grounds on which the Philanthropic Society now claims the attention and solicits the patronage of the public. If we regard humanity and religion, this institution opens an asylum to the most forlorn and subject of the human race; it befriends the most friendless; it saves from the certain and fatal consequences of infamy and vicious courses orphans and deserted children. If we regard national prosperity and the public welfare, it is calculated to increase industry; and it directs that industry into the most useful and necessary channels. If we regard self-interest, its immediate object is to protect our persons from assault and murder, our property from depredation, and our peaceful habitations from the desperate fury of midnight incendiaries.\n\nOne guinea per annum constitutes a member of the society; and \u00a310. at one payment a member for life. A life-subscription, or an annual payment of at least two guineas, is a necessary qualification for being elected into the committee.\n\nII. SOCIETIES FOR PROMOTING SCIENCE AND LITERATURE.\n\n1. The Royal Society of London is an academy or body of persons of eminent learning, instituted by Charles II. for the promoting of natural knowledge. The origin of this society is traced by Dr Sprat, its earliest historian, no farther back than to \"some space after the end of the civil wars\" in the 17th century. The scene of the first meetings of the learned men who laid the foundation of it, is by him fixed in the university of Oxford at the lodgings of Dr Wilkins warden of Wadham college. But Dr Birch, on the authority of Dr Wallis, one of its earliest and most considerable members, affirms it an earlier origin. According to him, certain worthy persons residing in London about the year 1645, being \"inquisitive into natural and the new and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a>, agreed to meet weekly on a certain day, to discourse upon such subjects, and were known by the title of The Invisible or Philosophical College.\" In the years 1648 and 1649, the company who formed these meetings was divided, part retiring to Oxford and part remaining in London; but they continued the same pursuits as when united, corresponding with each other, and giving a mutual account of their respective discoveries. About the year 1659 the greater part of the Oxford society returned to London, and again uniting with their fellow-labourers, met once, if not twice, a-week at Gresham college, during term time, till they were scattered by the public dilapidations of that year, and the place of their meeting made a quarter for soldiers. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> 1660 their meetings were revived, and attended by a greater concourse of men eminent for their rank and learning. They were at last taken notice of by the king, who having himself a considerable taste for physical science, was pleased to grant them an ample charter, dated the 13th of July 1662, and afterwards a second dated 15th April 1663, by which they were erected into a corporation, consisting of a president, council, and fellows, for promoting natural knowledge; and to give their investigations, against which strange prejudices were entertained, every possible support, he sometimes honoured their meetings with his presence.\n\nTheir manner of electing fellows is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLOTING\">balloting</a>. Their council are in number 21, including the president, vice-president, treasurer, and two secretaries; 11 of which are continued for the next year, and 10 more added to them; all chosen on St Andrew's day. Each member at his admission subscribes an engagement that he will endeavour to promote the good of the society; from which he may be freed at any time, by signifying to the president that he desires to withdraw. The charges have been different at different times, and were\nSociety for at first irregularly paid; but they are now five guineas paid to the treasurer at admission, and 12s. per quarter so long as the person continues a member; or, in lieu of the annual subscription, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of 25 guineas in one payment.\n\nTheir design is, to \"make faithful records of all the works of nature or art which come within their reach; so that the present as well as future ages may be enabled to put a mark on errors which have been strengthened by long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a>; to restore truths that have been neglected; to push those already known to more various uses; to make the way more palpable to what remains unrevealed,\" &c. To this purpose they have made a great number of experiments and observations on most of the works of nature; and also numbers of short histories of nature, arts, manufactures, useful engines, contrivances, &c. The services which they have rendered to the public are very great. They have improved naval, civil, and military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>; advanced the security and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>; improved agriculture; and not only this kingdom, but also Ireland, the plantations, &c., upon planting. They have registered experiments, histories, relations, observations, &c., and reduced them into one common stock; and have, from time to time, published those which they reckoned most useful, under the title of Philosophical Transactions, &c., and laid the rest up in public registers, to be nakedly transmitted to posterity, as a solid groundwork for future systems.\n\nThey have a library adapted to their institution; towards which Mr Henry Howard, afterwards duke of Norfolk, contributed the Norfolcian library, and which is, at this time, greatly increased by a continual series of benefactions. The museum or repository of natural and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> rarities, given them by Daniel Colvall, Esq., and since enriched by many others, is now removed to the British museum, and makes a part of that great repository. Their motto is Nullius in verba; and their place of assembling is Somerset-house in the Strand. Sir Godfrey Copley, baronet, left five guineas to be given annually to the person who should write the best paper in the year, under the head of experimental philosophy. This reward, which is now changed to a gold medal, is the highest honour the society can bestow. It is conferred on St Andrew's day.\n\n2. The Royal Society of Edinburgh, was incorporated by royal charter on the 29th of March 1783, and has for its object the cultivation of every branch of science, erudition, and taste. Its rise and progress towards its present state was as follows: In the year 1718 a literary society was established in Edinburgh by the learned Ruddiman and others, which in 1731 was succeeded by a society instituted for the improvement of medical knowledge. In the year 1739 the celebrated MacLaurin conceived the idea of enlarging the plan of this society, by extending it to subjects of philosophy and literature. The institution was accordingly new-modelled by a printed set of laws and regulations, the number of members was increased, and they were distinguished from that time by the title of The Society for Improving Arts and Sciences, or more generally by the title of The Philosophical Society of Edinburgh. Its meetings, however, were soon interrupted by the disorders of the country during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> in 1745; and they were not renewed till the year 1752. Soon after this period the first volume of the Transactions of the Society for Philosophical Society of Edinburgh was published, under the title of Essays and Observations, Physical and Literary, and was followed by other volumes of acknowledged merit. About the end of the year 1782, in a meeting of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of the university of Edinburgh, many of whom were likewise members of the Philosophical Society, and warmly attached to its interests, a scheme was proposed by the Rev. Dr Robertson, principal of the university, for the establishment of a new society on a more extended plan, and after the model of some of the foreign academies. It appeared an expedient measure to solicit the royal patronage to an institution of this nature, which promised to be of national importance, and to request an establishment by charter from the crown. The plan was approved and adopted; and the Philosophical Society, joining its influence as a body in seconding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> from the university, his majesty, as we have already observed, was most graciously pleased to incorporate The Royal Society of Edinburgh by charter.\n\nThis society consists of ordinary and honorary members; and the honorary places are restricted to persons residing out of Great Britain and Ireland. The election of new members is appointed to be made at two stated general meetings, which are to be held on the fourth Monday of January and the fourth Monday of June. A candidate for the place of an ordinary member must signify by a letter, addressed to one of the members, his wish to be received into the society. He must then be publicly proposed at least a month before the day of election. If the proposal be seconded by two of the members present, his name is to be inserted in the list of candidates, and hung up in the ordinary place of meeting. The election is made by ballot, and is determined in favour of a candidate, if he shall have the votes of two-thirds of those present, in a meeting consisting of at least 21 members. The general business of the society is managed by a president, two vice-presidents, with a council of 12, a general secretary, and a treasurer. These officers are chosen by ballot annually on the last Monday of November. All public deeds, whether of a civil or of a literary nature, are transacted by this board, and proceed in the name of the president or vice-president.\n\nAs it was thought that the members would have a greater inducement to punctual attendance on the meetings of the society, if they had some general intimation of the nature of the subjects which were to be considered, and made the topics of conversation, it was therefore resolved to divide the society into two classes, which should meet and deliberate separately. One of these classes is denominated the Physical Class, and has for its department the sciences of mathematics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>, and whatever relates to the improvement of arts and manufactures. The other is denominated the Literary Class, and has for its department literature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PHILOLOGY\">philology</a>, history, antiquities, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy. Every member is desired at his admission to intimate which of those classes he wishes to be more particularly associated with; but he is at the same time entitled to attend the meetings of the other class, and to take part in all its proceedings. Each of the classes has four presidents and two secretaries, who officiate by turns. The meetings\nSocieties for of the physical clasf are held on the first Mondays of January, February, March, April, July, August, November, and December; and the meetings of the Literary clasf are held on the third Mondays of January, February, March, April, June, July, November, and December, at 7 o'clock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>.\n\nAt these meetings the written essays and observations of the members of the society, or their correspondents, are read publicly, and become the subjects of conversation. The subjects of these essays and observations are announced at a previous meeting, in order to engage the attendance of those members who may be particularly interested in them. The author of each dissertation is likewise desired to furnish the society with an abstract of it, to be read at the next ensuing meeting, when the conversation is renewed with increased advantage, from the knowledge previously acquired of the subject. At the same meetings are exhibited such specimens of natural or artificial curiosities, such remains of antiquity, and such experiments, as are thought worthy of the attention of the society. All objects of natural history presented to the society, are ordered by the charter of the institution to be deposited, on receipt, in the museum of the university of Edinburgh; and all remains of antiquity, public records, or ancient manuscripts, in the library belonging to the faculty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> at Edinburgh.\n\nThe ordinary members, whose usual residence is in the city of Edinburgh or its immediate neighbourhood, are expected to attend regularly the monthly meetings; and are required to defray, by an annual contribution, the current expenses of the institution. The members who reside at such a distance from Edinburgh, that they cannot enjoy the advantages arising from a regular attendance on the meetings of the society, are not subjected to any contribution for defraying its expenses, but have a right to attend those meetings when occasionally in Edinburgh, and to take part in all their proceedings.\n\nFive volumes of the Transactions of the society have been published, which bear ample testimony to the learning and acuteness of their various authors.\n\n3. Medical Society of London, instituted in the year 1752, on the plan recommended by Lord Bacon (De Augm. Scient. lib. iv. cap. 2.), to revive the Hippocratic method of composing narratives of particular cases, in which the nature of the disease, the manner of treating it, and the consequences, are to be specified; to attempt the cure of those diseases which, in his opinion, have been too boldly pronounced incurable; and, lastly, to extend their inquiries after the powers of particular medicines in the cure of particular cases; the collections of this society have been already published, under the title of Medical Observations and Inquiries, in several volumes.\n\n4. The Medical Society of Edinburgh was incorporated by royal charter in 1778; but there appears to have been in that city a voluntary association of the same name from the first establishment of a regular school of physic in the university. To the voluntary society the public is indebted for five volumes of curious and useful essays, collected principally by the late Dr Monro from June 1731 to June 1736; but in the year 1739 that society was united to another, as we have already observed in a former article. The ordinary members of the present medical society are elected by ballot, and Societies for three dissentients exclude a candidate; an ordinary member may also be elected an honorary member, who enjoys the privileges of the others, and receives a diploma, but is freed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> of attendance, delivering papers in rotation, &c., to which the ordinary members are subject; but in this case the votes must be unanimous. The meetings of this society are held every Friday evening (formerly Saturday) in their own hall, during the winter season, when papers on medical subjects are delivered by the several members in rotation; and four of these are annually elected to fill the chair in rotation, with the title of annual presidents. This society possesses an excellent library of books on subjects connected with its pursuits.\n\n5. The Royal Medical Society of Paris was instituted in 1776. The members are divided into affiliates ordinary, limited to 30, honorary to 12, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> to 60, and foreign to 60, and correspondents. This society has published several volumes of Memoirs in 4to.\n\n6. Asiatic Society, an institution planned by the late illustrious Sir William Jones, and actually formed at Calcutta on the 15th of January 1784, for the purpose of tracing the history, antiquities, arts, sciences, and literature, of the immense continent of Asia. As it was resolved to follow as nearly as possible the plan of the Royal Society of London, of which the king is patron, the patronage of the Asiatic Society was offered to the governor-general and council, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a> in the territories of the company. By their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of this offer, Mr Haftings, as governor-general, appeared among the patrons of the new society; but he seemed in his private station, as the first liberal promoter of useful knowledge in Bengal, and especially as the great encourager of Persian and Sanscrit literature, to deserve a particular mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; he was requested, therefore, to accept the honorary title of president. This was handsomely declined in a letter from Mr Haftings, in which he requested \"to yield his pretensions to the gentleman whose genius planned the institution, and was most capable of conducting it to the attainment of the great and splendid purposes of its formation.\" On the receipt of this letter, Sir William Jones was nominated president of the society; and we cannot give the reader a view of the object of the institution in clearer language than that which he employed in his first discourse from the chair.\n\n\"It is your design, I conceive (said the president), to take an ample space for your learned investigations, bounding them only by the geographical limits of Asia; so that, considering Hindoostan as a centre, and turning your eyes in idea to the north, you have on your right many important kingdoms in the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, the ancient and wonderful empire of China with all her Tartarian dependencies, and that of Japan, with the clutter of precious islands, in which many singular curiosities have too long been concealed: before you lies that prodigious chain of mountains, which formerly perhaps were a barrier against the violence of the sea, and beyond them the very interesting country of Tibet, and the vast regions of Tartary, from which, as from the Trojan horse of the poets, have issued so many confederate warriors, whose domain has extended at least from the banks of the Ilyus to the mouths of the Ganges: on your left are the beautiful and celebrated provinces...\"\nSocieties for or of Iran or Persia, the unmeasured and perhaps unmeasurable deserts of Arabia, and the once flourishing kingdom of Yemen, with the pleasant isles that the Arabs have subdued or colonized; and farther westward, the Asiatic dominions of the Turkish sultans, whose moon seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> rapidly to its wane. By this great circumference the field of your useful researches will be inclosed; but since Egypt had unquestionably an old connection with this country, if not with China, since the language and literature of the Abyssinians bear a manifest affinity to those of Asia, since the Arabian arms prevailed along the African coast of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and even erected a powerful dynasty on the continent of Europe, you may not be deprived occasionally to follow the streams of Asiatic learning a little beyond its natural boundary; and, if it be necessary or convenient that a short name or epithet be given to our society, in order to distinguish it in the world, that of Asiatic appears both classical and proper, whether we consider the place or the object of the institution, and preferable to Oriental, which is in truth a word merely relative, and though commonly used in Europe, conveys no very distinct idea.\n\n\"If now it be asked, What are the intended objects of our inquiries within these spacious limits? we answer, Man and Nature; whatever is performed by the one or produced by the other. Human knowledge has been elegantly analyzed according to the three great faculties of the mind, memory, reason, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, which we constantly find employed in arranging and retaining, comparing and distinguishing, combining and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERSIFYING\">diversifying</a>, the ideas, which we receive through our senses, or acquire by reflection; hence the three main branches of learning are, history, science, and art; the first comprehends either an account of natural productions, or the genuine records of empires and states, the second embraces the whole circle of pure and mixed mathematics, together with ethics and law, as far as they depend on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> faculty; and the third includes all the beauties of imagery and the charms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in modulated language, or represented by colour, figure, or sound.\n\n\"Accordingly to this analysis, you will investigate whatever is rare in the stupendous fabric of nature, will correct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> of Asia by new observations and discoveries; will trace the annals and even traditions of those nations who from time to time have peopled or depopulated it; and will bring to light their various forms of government, with their institutions civil and religious; you will examine their improvements and methods in arithmetic and geometry; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, optics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and general physics; their systems of morality, grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic; their skill in chirurgery and medicine; and their advancement, whatever it may be, in anatomy and chemistry. To this you will add researches into their agriculture, manufactures, trade; and whilst you inquire with pleasure into their music, architecture, painting, and poetry, will not neglect those inferior arts by which the comforts and even elegancies of social life are supplied or improved. You may observe, that I have omitted their languages, the diversity and difficulty of which are a sad obstacle to the progress of useful knowledge; but I have ever considered languages as the mere instruments of real learning, and think them improperly confounded with learning itself: the attainment of them is, however, indistinguishably necessary; and if to the Persian, Armenian, Turkish, and Arabic, could be added not only the Shanfrit, the treasures of which we may now hope to see unlocked, but even the Chinese, Tartarian, Japanese, and the various Indian dialects, an immense mine would then be open, in which we might labour with equal delight and advantage.\"\n\nOf this society three volumes of the Transactions have been published, which are replete with information in a high degree curious and important; and we hope that the European world shall soon be favoured with another. The much-to-be-lamented death of the accomplished president may indeed damp the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> among the members; for to conquer difficulties so great as they must meet with, a portion seems to be necessary of that enthusiasm which accompanied all the pursuits of Sir William Jones; but his successor is a man of great worth and learning, and we trust will use his utmost endeavours to have the plan completed of which Sir William gave the outlines.\n\n5. The American Philosophical Society, held at Philadelphia, was formed in January 1769 by the union of two societies which had formerly subsisted in that city. This society extends its attention to geography, mathematics, natural philosophy, and astronomy; medicine and anatomy; natural history and chemistry; trade and commerce; mechanics and architecture; husbandry and American improvements. Its officers are a patron, president, three vice-presidents, one treasurer, four secretaries, and three curators, who are annually chosen by ballot. The duty of the president, vice-presidents, treasurer, and secretaries, is the same as in other societies. The business of the curators is to take the charge of all specimens of natural productions, whether of the animal, vegetable, or fossil kingdom; all models of machines and instruments; and all other matters belonging to the society which shall be intrusted to them. The ordinary meetings are held on the first and third Fridays of every month from October to May inclusive. This society was incorporated by charter 15th March 1780; and has published three volumes of its Transactions, containing many ingenious papers on general literature and the sciences, as well as respecting those subjects peculiar to America. It is a delightful prospect to the philosopher to consider, that Asia, Europe, and America, though far separated and divided into a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> states, are all three combined to promote the cause of knowledge and truth.\n\n6. A Literary and Philosophical Society of considerable reputation has been lately established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, under the direction of two presidents, four vice-presidents, and two secretaries. The number of members is limited to 50; besides whom there are several honorary members, all of whom are elected by ballot; and the officers are chosen annually in April. Five volumes of valuable essays have been already published by this society.\n\nA society on a similar plan has been established at Newcastle. It is composed of a number of most respectable members, and possesses a very valuable library and philosophical apparatus. Lectures on the different branches of natural philosophy have been delivered for several years at this institution.\n\n7. Society for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts\nThis society or association for exploring the internal districts of Africa, of which so little is at present known, was formed in London by some opulent individuals in 1788; who, strongly impressed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of the practicability and utility of thus enlarging the fund of human knowledge, determined if possible to rescue the age from that stigma which attaches to its ignorance of so large and so near a portion of the globe. The founders of this society resolved to admit no man a member for a shorter period than three years, during which he must pay annually into the public fund five guineas. After three years, any member, upon giving a year's notice, may withdraw himself from the association. During the first 12 months each of the members was allowed to recommend for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of the society such of his friends as he might think proper to be admitted into it; but since that period we believe all additional members have been elected by a ballot of the association at large. A committee was chosen by ballot to manage the funds of the society, to choose proper persons to be sent on the discovery of the interior parts of Africa, and to carry on the society's correspondence, with express injunctions to disclose no intelligence received from their agents but to the society at large. But a fuller account of the nature of this establishment, and the very happy efforts they have made, may be seen in the superb edition of their proceedings printed in 1799, 4to, for their own use; or in the 8vo edition since made public. They soon found two gentlemen, Mr Lucas and Mr Ledyard, who were singularly well qualified for the important mission. The information they have acquired will be found in the above work; with a new map by Mr Rennell, exhibiting the geographical knowledge collected by the African association. Mr Ledyard very unfortunately died during his researches at Cairo.\n\nFew of our readers are unacquainted with the travels of Mr Park under the patronage of the society. For an account of which see Africa. A second journey was undertaken by the same gentleman within these three years; but as he has not been heard of for a long time, the most serious apprehensions are entertained that he and his companions have fallen victims either to the inhospitable climate, or to the watchful jealousy of the Moors. Another enterprising traveller, Mr Horneman, was sent out by the society about 1800. He departed from Cairo with a caravan, and reached Mourzouk, a place situated south from Tripoli; and from thence sent a communication to his constituents which has since been published by the society. This is the last account that was received of this traveller, from which it is feared that he has also perished.\n\n8. The Society of Antiquaries of London, was founded about the year 1572 by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> Parker, a munificent patron of learned men. For the space of 20 years it assembled in the house of Sir Robert Cotton; in 1589 they resolved to apply to Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> for a charter and a public building where they might hold their meetings; but it is uncertain whether any such application was ever made. In the mean time, the reputation of the society gradually increased, and at length it excited the jealousy of James I., who was afraid lest it should presume to canvass the secret transactions of his government. He accordingly disfavored it. But in the beginning of the last century, the Antiquarian society began to revive; and a number of gentlemen, eminent for their societies for affection to this science, had weekly meetings, in which they examined the antiquities and history of Great Britain preceding the reign of James I., but without excluding any other remarkable antiquities that might be offered to them. From this time the society grew in importance; and in 1750 they unanimously resolved to petition the king for a charter of incorporation. This they obtained the year following, by the influence of the celebrated earl of Hardwicke, then lord-chancellor, and Martin Folkes, Esq.; who was then their president. The king declared himself their founder and patron, and empowered them to have a body of statutes, and a common seal, and to hold in perpetuity lands, &c., to the yearly value of \u00a31000.\n\nThe chief object of the inquiries and researches of the society are British antiquities and history; not, however, wholly excluding those of other countries. It must be acknowledged, that the study of antiquity offers to the curious and inquisitive a large field for research and amusement. The inquirer in this branch furnishes the historian with his best materials, while he distinguishes from truth the fictions of a bold invention, and ascertains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">credibility</a> of facts; and to the philosopher he presents a fruitful source of ingenious speculation, while he points out to him the way of thinking, and the manners of men, under all the varieties of aspect in which they have appeared.\n\nAn antiquarian ought to be a man of solid judgement, possessed of learning and science, that he may not be an enthusiastic admirer of every thing that is ancient merely because it is ancient; but be qualified to distinguish between those researches which are valuable and important, and those which are trifling and useless. It is from the want of these qualifications that some men have contracted such a blind passion for every thing that is ancient, that they have exposed themselves to ridicule, and their study to contempt. But if a regard to utility were always to regulate the pursuits of the antiquarian, the shafts of satire would no longer be levelled at him; but he would be respected as the man who labours to restore or to preserve such ancient productions as are fitted to illuminate religion, philosophy, and history, or to improve the arts of life.\n\nWe by no means intend to apply these observations to any particular society of antiquarians; but we throw them out, because we know that an assiduous study of antiquity is apt, like the ardent pursuit of money, to lose sight of its original object, and to degenerate into a passion which mistakes the mean for the end, and considers possession without a regard to utility as enjoyment.\n\nAn association similar to that of the Antiquarian Society of London was founded in Edinburgh in 1782, and received the royal charter in 1783. A volume of the transactions of this society has been published; but with the exception of two or three memoirs, it contains little worthy of notice; and accordingly, it has never attracted the attention of the public.\n\nBesides these literary societies here mentioned, there are a great number more in different parts of Europe, some of which are noticed under the article Academy. Those which are omitted are not omitted on account of any idea of their inferior importance; but either be-\nIII. SOCIETIES FOR ENCOURAGING AND PROMOTING ARTS, MANUFACTURES, &c.\n\n1. London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, was instituted in the year 1754 by Lord Folkestone, Lord Romney, Dr Stephen Hales, and a few private gentlemen; but the merit of this institution chiefly belonged to Mr William Shipley, an ingenious mechanic; who, though deriving no advantages from learning, by unwearied personal attendance found means to engage a few persons of rank and fortune to meet at Peele's coffeehouse in Fleet-street, and to adopt a plan for promoting arts and manufactures.\n\nThe office-bearers of this society are a president, 12 vice-presidents, a secretary, and registrar. Their proceedings are regulated by a body of rules and orders established by the whole society, and printed for the use of the members. All questions and debates are determined by the holding up of hands, or by ballot if required; and no matter can be confirmed without the assent of a majority at two meetings. They invite all the world to propose subjects for encouragement; and whatever is deemed deserving of attention is referred to the consideration of a committee, which, after due inquiry and deliberation, make their report to the whole society, where it is approved, rejected, or altered. A list is printed and published every year of the matters for which they propose to give premiums; which premiums are either sums of money, and those sometimes very considerable ones; or the society's medal in gold or silver, which they consider as the greatest honour they can bestow. All possible care is taken to prevent partiality in the distribution of their premiums, by defining the claimants' names to be concealed, and by appointing committees, (who when they find occasion call to their assistance the most skilful artists) for the strict examination of the real merit of all matters and things brought before them, in consequence of their premiums.\n\nThe chief objects of the attention of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, in the application of their revenues, are ingenuity in the several branches of the polite and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERAL_ARTS\">liberal arts</a>, useful discoveries and improvements in agriculture, manufactures, mechanics, and chemistry, or the laying open of any such to the public; and, in general, all such useful inventions, discoveries, or improvements (though not mentioned in the book of premiums) as may appear to have a tendency to the advantage of trade and commerce.\n\nThe following are some of the most important regulations of this society. It is required that the matters for which premiums are offered be delivered in without names, or any intimation to whom they belong; that each particular thing be marked in what manner each claimant thinks fit, such claimant sending with it a paper sealed up, having on the outside a corresponding mark, and on the inside the claimant's name and address; and all candidates are to take notice, that no claim for a premium will be attended to, unless the conditions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a> are fully complied with. No papers shall be opened but such as shall gain premiums, unless where it appears to the society absolutely necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the claim: all the refuse shall be returned unopened, with the matters to which they belong, if inquired after by the marks within two years; after which time, if not demanded, they shall be publicly burnt unopened at some meeting of the society. All the premiums of this society are designed for that part of Great Britain called England, the dominion of Wales, and the town of Berwick upon Tweed, unless expressly mentioned to the contrary. No person shall receive any premium, bounty, or encouragement, from the society for any matter for which he has obtained or proposes to obtain a patent. No member of this society shall be a candidate for or intitled to receive any premium, bounty, or reward whatever, except the honorary medal of the society.\n\nThe respectability of the members who compose it may be seen by perusing the list which generally accompanies their transactions. In the last volume (vol. xii.) it occupies no less than 43 pages. Some idea may be formed of the wealth of this society, by observing that the list of their premiums fills 96 pages, and amounts to 250 in number. These consist of gold medals worth from 30 to 50s., and in a few instances to 100 guineas; and silver medals valued at 10 guineas.\n\nThis society is one of the most important in Great Britain. Much money has been expended by it, and many are the valuable effects of which it has been productive. Among these we reckon not only the discoveries which it has excited, but the institution of other societies on the same principles to which it has given birth; and we do not hesitate to conclude, that future ages will consider the founding of this society as one of the most remarkable epochs in the history of the arts. We contemplate with pleasure the beneficial effects which must result to this nation and to mankind by the diffusion of such institutions; and rejoice in the hope that the active minds of the people of Great Britain, instead of being employed as formerly in controversies about religion, which engender strife, or in discussions concerning the theory of politics, which lead to the adoption of schemes inconsistent with the nature and condition of man, will soon be more generally united into associations for promoting useful knowledge and solid improvement, and for alleviating the distresses of their fellow creatures.\n\n1. Society instituted at Bath for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. It was founded in the year 1777 by several gentlemen who met at the city of Bath. This scheme met with a very favourable reception both from the wealthy and learned. The wealthy subscribed very liberally, and the learned communicated many important papers. On application to the London and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> societies instituted for the like purposes, they very politely offered their assistance. Seven volumes of their transactions have already been published, containing very valuable experiments and observations, particularly respecting agriculture, which well deserve the attention of all farmers in the kingdom. We have consulted them with much satisfaction on several occasions, and have frequently referred to them in the course of this work; and therefore, with pleasure, embrace\nSocieties for embracing the present opportunity of repeating our obligations. We owe the same acknowledgments to the Society for the Improvement of Arts, &c., of London.\n\n3. Society for working Mines, an association lately formed on the continent of Europe. This institution arose from the accidental meeting of several mineralogists at Skleno near Schenmuth in Hungary, who were collected in order to examine a new method of amalgamation. Struck with the shackles imposed on mining by monopolizers of new and useful processes, they thought no method so effectual to break them, as forming a society, whose common labours should be directed to fix mining on its surest principles; and whose memoirs, spread all over Europe, might offer to every adventurer the result of the researches, of which they are the object. By these means they supposed, that there would be a mass of information collected; the interests of individuals would be lost in the general interest; and the one would materially assist the other. Imposture and quackery would, by the same means, be banished from a science, which must be improved by philosophy and experience; and the society, they supposed, would find, in the confidence which they inspired, the reward and the encouragement of their labours. They design, that the memoirs which they publish shall be short and clear; truth must be their basis, and every idle diffusion, every foreign digression, must be banished; politics and finance must be avoided, though the dissertations may seem to lead towards them; and they oblige themselves to oppose the affectation of brilliancies, and the ostentation of empty speculation, when compared with plain, simple, and useful facts.\n\nThe object of the society is physical geography; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINERALOGY\">mineralogy</a> founded on chemistry; the management of ore in the different operations which it undergoes; subterranean geometry; the history of mining; foundries, and the processes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of metals from the ores, either by fusion or amalgamation, in every instance applied to practice. The end of this institution is to collect, in the most extensive sense, everything that can assist the operations of the miner, and to communicate it to the different members, that they may employ it for the public good, in their respective countries. Each member must consider himself as bound to send to the society every thing which will contribute to the end of its institution; to point out, with precision, the several facts and observations; to communicate every experiment which occurs, even the unsuccessful ones, if the relation may seem to be advantageous to the public; to communicate to the society their examination of schemes, and their opinions on questions proposed by it; and to pay annually two ducats (about 18s. 6d.) to the direction every Easter. The society, on the other hand, is bound to publish every novelty that shall be communicated to it; to communicate to each member, at the member's expense, the memoirs, designs, models, productions, and every thing connected with the institution; to answer all the necessary demands made, relating in any respect to mining; and to give its opinion on every plan or project communicated through the medium of an honorary member.\n\nThe great centre of all intelligence is to be at Zellerfield in Hartz, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>; but the society is not fixed to any one spot; for every particular state some practical mineralogist is nominated as director. Among these are the names of Baron Born, M. Pallas, M. Charpentier, M. Prebra, and M. Henkel. Their office is to propose the members; to take care that the views of the society are pursued in the different countries where they reside; to answer the requests of the members of their manufactures, country who are qualified to make them; in case of the death of a director, to choose another; and the majority is to determine where the archives and the strong box is to be placed.\n\nAll the eminent mineralogists in Europe are members of this society. It is erected on so liberal and so extensive a plan, that we entertain the highest hopes of its success; and have only to add, that we wish much to see the study of several other sciences pursued in the same manner.\n\n4. The Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture, was founded in 1791. The object of it is to encourage every useful invention and discovery relating to naval architecture as far as shall be in their power, both by honorary and pecuniary rewards. They have in view particularly to improve the theories of floating bodies and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESISTANCE_OF_FLUIDS\">resistance of fluids</a>; to procure draughts and models of different vessels, together with calculations of their capacity, centre of gravity, tonnage, &c.; to make observations and experiments themselves, and to point out such observations and experiments as appear best calculated to further their designs, and most deserving those premiums which the society can bestow. But though the improvement of naval architecture in all its branches be certainly the principal object of this institution, yet the society do not by any means intend to confine themselves merely to the form and structure of vessels. Every subordinate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> pursuit will claim a share of the attention of the society in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to its merits; and whatever may have any tendency to render navigation more safe, salutary, and even pleasant, will not be neglected.\n\nThis institution owes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> to the patriotic disposition and extraordinary attention of Mr Sewell a private citizen of London, who (though engaged in a line of business totally opposite to all concerns of this kind) has been led, by mere accident, to take such ocular notice of, and make such observations on, the actual state of naval architecture in this country, as naturally occurred to a man of plain understanding, zealous for the honour and interest of his country, and willing to bestow a portion of that time for the public good, which men of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> would rather have devoted to their own private advantage. His attention was the more seriously excited, by finding that it was the opinion of some private ship-builders, who, in a debate on the failure of one of our naval engagements, pronounced, that such \"would ever be the case while that business (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of our ships of war) was not studied as a science, but carried on merely by precedent; that there had not been one improvement in our navy that did not originate with the French, who had naval schools and seminaries for the study of it; and that our ships were not a match for those of that nation either singly or in a fleet, &c., &c.\"\n\nIn a short time the society were enabled to offer very considerable premiums for particular improvements in the construction of our shipping, &c., &c. and also to encourage our philosophers, mathematicians, and mechanics, to make satisfactory experiments, tending to ascertain\nSocieties for certain the laws of resistance of water to solids of different forms, in all varieties of circumstance. On this head the reward is not less than one hundred pounds or a gold medal. Other premiums of 50, 30, and 20 guineas, according to the importance or difficulty of the particular subject or point of investigation, are likewise offered, for different discoveries, inventions, or improvements. The terms of admission into the society are a subscription of two guineas annually, or twenty guineas for life.\n\n5. Society of Artists of Great Britain, which consists of directors and fellows, was incorporated by charter in 1765, and empowered to purchase and hold lands, not exceeding 1000l. a-year. The directors of this society, annually elected, are to consist of 24 persons, including the president, vice-president, treasurer, and secretary; and it is required that they be either painters, sculptors, architects, or engravers by profession.\n\n6. British Society for Extending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a> and Improving the Sea-Coasts of this Kingdom, was instituted in 1786. The end and design of this society will best appear from their charter, of which we present an abstract.\n\nThe preamble states, \"the great want of improvement in fisheries, agriculture, and manufactures, in the Highlands and Islands of North Britain; the prevalence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a> from the want of employment in those parts; the prospect of a new nursery of seamen, by the establishment of fishing towns and villages in that quarter. The act therefore declares, that the persons therein named, and every other person or persons who shall thereafter become proprietors of the joint stock mentioned therein, shall be a distinct and separate body politic and corporate, by the name of The British Society for Extending the Fisheries and Improving the Sea-Coasts of this Kingdom: That the said society may raise a capital joint stock not exceeding 150,000l. to be applied to purchasing or otherwise acquiring lands and tenements in perpetuity, for the building thereon, and on no other land whatever, free towns, villages, and fishing stations: That the joint stock shall be divided into shares of 50l. each: That no person shall in his or her name possess more than ten shares, or 500l.: That the society shall not borrow any sum or sums of money whatsoever: That the sums to be advanced for this undertaking, and the profits arising therefrom, shall be divided proportionally to the sum subscribed; and that no person shall be liable for a larger sum than he or she the share have respectively subscribed: That one or two shares shall entitle to one vote and no more, in person or by proxy, at all meetings of proprietors; three or four shares to two votes; five, six, or seven shares, to three votes; eight or nine shares to four votes; and ten shares to five votes and no more: That more persons than one inclining to hold in their joint names one or more shares shall be entitled to vote, by one of such persons, according to the priority of their names, or by proxy: That bodies corporate shall vote by proxy under their seal: That all persons holding proxies shall be proprietors, and that no one person shall hold more than five votes by proxy: That the affairs of the society shall be managed by a governor, deputy governor, and 13 other directors, to be elected annually on the 25th of March, from among the proprietors of the society, holding at least one full share, by signed lists of their names to be transmitted by the proprietors to the secretary of the society: that five proprietors, not being governor, director, or other officer, shall be in like manner annually elected to audit the accounts of the society: That there shall be one general meeting of the proprietors annually on the 25th of March: That occasional general meetings shall be called on the request of nine or more proprietors: That the general meetings of the proprietors shall make all bye-laws and constitutions for the government of the society, and for the good and orderly carrying on of the business of the same: That no transfer shall be made of the stock of the society for three years from the 16th of August 1786: That the cash of the society shall be lodged in the bank of England, bank of Scotland, or the royal bank of Scotland: That no director, proprietor, agent, or officer of the society, shall retain any sum or sums of money in his hands beyond the space of 30 days, on any account whatsoever: That all payments by the society shall be made by drafts on the said banks, under the hands of the governor or deputy-governor, counter-signed by the secretary or his deputy, and two or more directors: And that the books in which the accounts of the society shall be kept shall be open to all the proprietors.\"\n\nThe institution of this public-spirited society was in a great measure owing to the exertions of the patriotic John Knox; who, in the course of 23 years, traversed and explored the Highlands of Scotland not fewer than 16 times, and expended several thousand pounds of his own fortune in pursuing his patriotic designs.\n\n7. British Wool Society. See British Wool Society.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY_ISLES\">SOCIETY Isles</a>, a cluster of isles, so named by Captain Cook in 1769. They are situated between the latitudes of 16\u00b0 10' and 16\u00b0 55' south, and between the longitudes of 150\u00b0 37' and 152\u00b0 west. They are eight in number; namely, Otahete, Huaheine, Ulietea, Otaha, Bolabola, Maurua, Tooouai, and Tabooyamanoo or Saunders's Island. The soil, productions, people, their language, religion, customs, and manners, are so nearly the same as at Otahete, that little need be added here on that subject. Nature has been equally bountiful in uncultivated plenty, and the inhabitants are as luxurious and as indolent. A plantain branch is the emblem of peace, and exchanging names the greatest token of friendship. Their dances are more elegant, their dramatic entertainments have something of plot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a>, and they exhibit temporary occurrences as the objects of praise or satire; so that the origin of ancient comedy may be already discerned among them. The people of Huaheine are in general flouter and fairer than those of Otahete, and this island is remarkable for its populousness and fertility. Those of Ulietea, on the contrary, are smaller and blacker, and much less orderly. Captain Cook put on shore a Cape ewe at Bolabola, where a ram had been left by the Spaniards; and also an English boar and sow, with two goats, at Ulietea. If the valuable animals which have been transported thither from Europe should be suffered to multiply, no part of the world will equal these islands in variety and abundance of refreshments for future navigators.","sp":48,"ep":62},{"h":"SOCIETY","t":"a number of rational and moral beings, united for their common preservation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>.\n\nThere are shoals of fishes, herds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>, and flocks of birds. But till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> enable us to determine with greater certainty, how far the inferior ant-capable of animals are able to look through a series of means to the social end which these are calculated to produce, how far their conduct may be influenced by the hope of reward and the fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and whether they are at all capable of moral distinctions\u2014we cannot with propriety apply to them the term Society. We call crows and beavers, and several other species of animals, gregarious; but it is hardly good English to say that they are social.\n\nIt is only human society, then, that can become the subject of our present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. The phenomena which it presents are highly worthy of our notice.\n\nSuch are the advantages which each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> evidently derives from living in a social state; and to behold, if we may use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, the social life, does any human being appear in a solitary state, that we are naturally led to conclude, that if there ever was a period at which mankind were solitary beings, that period could not be of long duration; for their aversion to solitude and love of society would soon induce them to enter into social union. Such is the opinion which we are led to conceive, when we compare our own condition as members of civilized and enlightened society with that of the brutes around us, or with that of savages in the earlier and ruder periods of social life. When we hear of Indians wandering naked through the woods, destitute of arts, unskilled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, scarce capable of moral distinctions, void of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> sentiments, or possessed with the most absurd notions concerning superior powers, and procuring means of subsistence in a manner equally precarious with that of the beasts of prey\u2014we look down with pity on their condition, or turn from it with horror. When we view the order of cultivated society, and consider our institutions, arts, and manners\u2014we rejoice over our superior wisdom and happiness.\n\nMan in a civilized state appears a being of a superior order to man in a savage state; yet some philosophers tell us, that it is only he who, having been educated in society, has been taught to depend upon others, that can be helpless or miserable when placed in a solitary state. They view the savage who exerts himself with intrepidity to supply his wants, or bears them with fortitude, as the greatest hero, and possessing the greatest happiness. And therefore if we agree with them, that the propensities of nature may have prompted men to enter into social union, though they may have hoped to enjoy superior security and happiness by engaging to protect and support each other, we must conclude that the Author of the universe has destined man to attain greater dignity and happiness in a savage and solitary than in a social state; and therefore that those dispositions and views which lead us to society are fallacious and inimical to our real interest.\n\nWhatever be the supposed advantages of a solitary state, certain it is that mankind, at the earliest periods, were united in society. Various theories have been formed concerning the circumstances and principles which gave rise to this union: but we have elsewhere shown, that the greater part of them are founded in error; that they suppose the original state of man to have been\nSociety.\n\nbeen that of savages; and that such a supposition is contradicted by the most authentic records of antiquity. For though the records of the earlier ages are generally obscure, fabulous, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; yet happily there is one free from the imperfections of the rest, and of undoubted authenticity, to which we may safely have\n\n*See Script-records*. This record is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTATEUCH\">Pentateuch</a> of Moses, which presents us with a genuine account of the origin of man and of society, perfectly consonant to what we have laid down in the article referred to (see Savage).\n\nAccording to Moses, the first society was that of a husband and wife united in the bonds of marriage: the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> that of a father and husband, the master of his family. Men lived together under the patriarchal form of government while they employed themselves chiefly in tending flocks and herds. Children in such circumstances cannot soon rise to an equality with their parents, where a man's importance depends on his property, not on his abilities. When flocks and herds are the chief articles of property, the son can only obtain these from his father; in general therefore the son must be entirely dependent on the father for the means of subsistence. If the parent during his life bestows on his children any part of his property, he may do it on such conditions as shall make their dependence upon him continue till the period of his death. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> are by this event deprived of their head, instead of continuing in a state of union, and selecting some one from among themselves whom they may invest with the authority of a parent, they separate into so many distinct tribes, each subjected to the authority of a different lord, the master of the family, and the proprietor of all the flocks and herds belonging to it. Such was the state of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> which the narrative of Moses exhibits to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\nThose philosophers who have made society, in its various stages between rudeness and refinement, the subject of their speculations, have generally considered mankind, in whatever region of the globe, and under whatever climate, as proceeding uniformly through certain regular gradations from one extreme to the other. They regard them, first, as gaining a precarious subsistence by gathering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> fruits of the earth, preying on the inhabitants of the waters, if placed on the seashore, or along the banks of large rivers; or hunting wild beasts, if in a situation where these are to be found in abundance; without foresight or industry to provide for future wants when the present call of appetite is gratified. Next, they say, man rises to the shepherd state, and next to that of husbandmen, when they turn their attention from the management of flocks to the cultivation of the ground. Next, these husbandmen improve their powers, and better their condition, by becoming artisans and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>; and the beginning of this period is the boundary between barbarity and civilization.\n\nThese are the stages through which they who have employed themselves on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> of society have generally conducted mankind in their progress from rudeness to refinement: but they seem to have overlooked the manner in which mankind were at first established on this earth; for the circumstances in which the parents of the human race were originally placed; for the degree of knowledge communicated to them; and for the instruction which they must have been capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to their posterity. They rather appear to consider the inhabitants of every different region of the globe as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABORIGINES\">aborigines</a>, springing at first from the ground, or dropped on the spot which they inhabit; no less ignorant than infants of the nature and relations of the objects around them, and of the purposes which they may accomplish by the exercise of their organs and faculties.\n\nThe absurdity of this theory has been fully demonstrated in another place: and if we agree to receive the Mosaic account of the original establishment of mankind, we shall be led to view the phenomena of social life in a light very different. We must first allow, that though many of the rudest tribes are found in the state of hunters or fishers; yet the hunting or fishing state cannot have been invariably the primary form of society. Notwithstanding the powers with which we are endowed, we are in a great measure the creatures of circumstances. Physical causes exert, though indirectly, a mighty influence in forming the character and directing the exertions of the human race. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of Moses we gather, that the first societies of men lived under the patriarchal form of government, and employed themselves in the cultivation of the ground and the management of flocks. And as we know that mankind, being subjected to the influence both of physical and moral causes, are no less liable to degeneracy than capable of improvement; we may easily conceive, that though descending all from the same original pair, and though enlightened with much traditional knowledge relative to the arts of life, the order of society, moral distinctions, and religious obligations; yet as they were gradually, and by various accidents, dispersed over the earth, being removed to situations in which the arts with which they were acquainted could but little avail them, where industry was overpowered, or indolence encouraged by the severity or the profusion of nature, they might degenerate and fall into a condition almost as humble and precarious as that of the brutal tribes. Other moral causes might also concur to debauch or elevate the human character in that early period. The particular character of the original settlers in any region, the manner in which they were connected with one another, and the arts which they were best qualified to exercise, with various other causes of a similar nature, would have considerable influence in determining the character of the society.\n\nWhen laying aside the spirit of theory and system, we let ourselves, with due humility, to trace facts, and to listen to evidence, though our discoveries may be fewer than we should otherwise fancy them; yet the knowledge which we thus acquire will be more useful and solid, and our speculations more consistent with the spirit of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. Here, though we learn from the information of the sacred writings, that the first family of mankind was not cruelly exposed in this world, as children whom the inhumanity of their parents induces them to desert; yet we are not, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of admitting this fact, laid under any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of denying or explaining away any of the other phenomena which occur to our observation when tracing the natural history of society. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">Tradition</a> may be corrupted; arts and sciences may be lost; the sublimest religious doctrines may be debauched into absurdity.\n\nIf then we are desirous of surveying society in its rudest\nSociety, we must look, not to the earliest period of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, but to those districts of the globe where external circumstances concur to drive them into a state of stupidity and wretchedness. Thus in many places of the happy clime of Asia, which a variety of ancient records concur with the sacred writings in representing as the first peopled quarter of the globe, we cannot trace the form of society backwards beyond the shepherd state. In that state indeed the bonds which connect society extend not to a wide range of individuals, and men remain for a long period in distinct families; but yet that state is highly favourable to knowledge, to happiness, and to virtue. Again, the torrid and the frozen regions of the earth, though probably peopled at a later period, and by tribes sprung from the same stock with the shepherds of Asia, have yet exhibited mankind in a much lower state. It is in the parched deserts of Africa and the wilds of America that human beings have been found in a condition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the nearest to that of the brutes.\n\nWe may therefore with some propriety desert the order of time, and take a view of the different stages through which philosophers have considered mankind as advancing, beginning with that of rudeness, though we have shown that it cannot have been the first in the progress.\n\nWhere the human species are found in the lowest and rudest state, their rational and moral powers are very faintly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a>; but their external senses are acute, and their bodily organs active and vigorous. Hunting and fishing are then their chief employments on which they depend for support. During that portion of their time which is not spent in these pursuits, they are sunk in listless indolence. Destitute of foresight, they are roused to active exertion only by the pressure of immediate necessity or the urgent calls of appetite. Accustomed to endure the severity of the elements, and but scantily provided with the means of subsistence, they acquire habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a> and fortitude, which are beheld with astonishment by those who enjoy the plenty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of cultivated life. But in this state of want and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a>, when the powers and possessions of every individual are scarcely sufficient for his own support, when even the calls of appetite are repressed because they cannot always be gratified, and the more refined passions, which either originate from such as are merely animal, or are intimately connected with them, have not yet been felt\u2014in this state all the milder affections are unknown; or if the breast is at all sensible to their impulse, it is extremely feeble. Husband and wife, parent and child, brother and brother, are united by the weakest ties. Want and misfortune are not pitied. Why indeed should they, where they cannot be relieved? It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to determine how far beings in this condition can be capable of moral distinctions. One thing certain is, that in no state are the human race entirely incapable of these. If we listen, however, to the relations of respectable travellers, we must admit that human beings have sometimes been found in that abject state where no proper ideas of subordination, government, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of ranks, could be formed. No distinct notions of Deity can be here entertained. Beings in so humble a condition cannot look through the order of the universe and the harmony of nature to that Eternal Wisdom and Goodness which contrived, and that Almighty Power which brought into existence, the system of things. Of arts they must be almost totally destitute. They may use some instruments for fishing or the chase; but these must be extremely rude and simple. If they be acquainted with any means to shelter them from the inclemency of the elements, both their houses and clothing will be awkward and inconvenient.\n\nBut human beings have not been often found in second rude a state as this. Even those tribes which we denominate savage, are for the most part farther removed from mere animal life. They generally appear united under some species of government, exercising the powers of reason, capable of morality, though that morality be not always very refined; displaying some degree of social virtues, and acting under the influence of religious sentiments. Those who may be considered as but one degree higher in the scale than the stupid and wretched beings whose condition we have surveyed, are to be found still in the hunting and fishing state; but they are farther advanced towards social life, and are becoming more sensible to the impulse of social affection. By unavoidable intercourse in their employments, a few individual hunters or fishers contract a certain degree of fondness for each other's company, and are led to take some part in each other's joys and sorrows; and when the social affections thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> (see PASSION) begin to exert themselves, all the other powers of the mind are at the same time called forth, and the circumstances of the little society are immediately improved. We behold its members in a more comfortable condition, and find reason to view the human character with more complacency and respect. Huts are now built, more commodious clothes are fashioned, instruments for the annoyance of wild beasts and even of enemies are contrived; in short, arts, and science, and social order, and religious sentiment, and ceremonies, now make their appearance in the rising society, and serve to characterize it by the particular form which distinguishes each of them. But though social order is no longer unknown nor unobserved, yet the form of government is still extremely simple, and its ties are but loose and feeble. It will perhaps bear some resemblance to the patriarchal; only all its members are on a more equal footing, and at the same time less closely connected than in the shepherd state, to which that form of government seems almost peculiar. The old men are treated with veneration; but the young are not entirely subject to them. They may listen respectfully to their advice; but they do not submit to their arbitrary commands. Where mankind are in the state of hunters and fishers, where the means of subsistence are precariously acquired, and prudent foresight does not prompt to accumulate much provision for the future, no individual can acquire comparative wealth. As soon as the son is grown up, he ceases to be dependent on his father, as well as on the society in general. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">Difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> therefore constitutes the only distinction between the young and the old; and if the old have experience, the young have strength and activity. Here, then, neither age nor property can give rise to any striking distinction of ranks. All who have attained to manhood, and are not disabled by unusual deficiency of strength or agility, or by the infirmities of old age, are on an equal footing; or if any one possesses a pre-eminence over the rest, he owes it to superior\nSociety. superior address or fortitude. The whole tribe deliberate; the old give their advice; each individual of the assembly receives or rejects it at its pleasure (for the whole body think not of exercising any compulsory power over the will of individuals); and the warrior who is most distinguished for strength, address, and valour, leads out the youth of the tribe to the chase or against the enemy. War, which in the former stage did not prevail, as they who were strangers to social sentiments were, at the same time, scarce capable of being enemies, now first begins to depopulate the thinly inhabited regions where those hunters and fishers pursue their prey. They are scattered, possibly in fealty and separate tribes, over an immense tract of country; but they know no medium between the affection which brethren of the same tribe bear to each other and the hatred of enemies. Though thinly scattered over the earth, yet the hunting parties of different tribes will sometimes meet as they range the forests; and when they meet, they will naturally view each other with a jealous eye; for the success of the one party in the chase may cause the other to be unsuccessful; and while the one snatches the prey, the other must return home to all the pangs of famine. Invererate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a> will therefore long prevail among neighbouring tribes in the hunting state.\n\nIf we find them not incapable of social order, we may naturally expect that their conduct will be influenced by some sentiments of religion. They have at this period ideas of superior beings. They also practice certain ceremonies to recommend them to those beings; but both their sentiments and ceremonies are superstitious and absurd.\n\nWe have elsewhere shown (see Polytheism) how savage tribes have probably degenerated from the pure worship of the one true God to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> of a multitude of imaginary divinities in heaven, earth, and hell. We have traced this idolatrous worship from that of the heavenly bodies, through all the gradations of daemon-worship, hero-worship, and statue-worship, to that wonderful instance of absurd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> which induced the inhabitants of some countries to fall prostrate in adoration before the vilest reptiles. But though we are convinced that the heavenly bodies have by all idolaters been considered as their first and greatest gods, we pretend not that the progress through the other stages of polytheism has been everywhere in the very same order. It is indeed impossible to exhibit under one general view an account of arts, manners, and religious sentiments, which may apply to some certain period in the history of every nation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> and circumstances of nations are scarce less various and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANOMALOUS\">anomalous</a> than those of individuals. Among many of the American tribes, among the ancient inhabitants of the forests of Germany, whose manners have been so accurately delineated by the masterly pen of Tacitus, and in some of the islands scattered over the southern ocean, religion, arts, and government, have been found in that state which we have described as characterising the second stage of social life. But neither can we pretend that all those simple and rude societies have been described by historians and travellers as agreeing precisely in their arts, manners, and religious sentiments; or that the difference of circumstances always enables us to account in a satisfactory manner for the distinction of their characters. There is a variety of facts in the history of the early periods of society, which no ingenuity, no industry however painful, can reduce under general heads. Here, as well as when we attempt to philosophize on the phenomena of the material world, we find reason to confess that our powers are weak, and our observation confined within a narrow sphere.\n\nBut we may now carry our views a little forward, and survey human life as approaching somewhat nearer to a civilized and enlightened state. As property is acquired, inequality and subordination of ranks necessarily follow; and when men are no longer equal, the many are soon subjected to the will of the few. But what and inequality gives rise to these new phenomena is, that after having often suffered from the precariousness of the hunting and fishing state, men begin to extend their cares beyond the present moment, and to think of providing some supply for future wants. When they are enabled to provide such a supply, either by pursuing the chase with new eagerness and perseverance, by gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, or by breeding tame animals\u2014these acquisitions are at first the property of the whole society, and distributed from a common store to each individual according to his wants: But as various reasons will soon concur to convince the community, that by this mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a>, industry and activity are treated with injustice, while negligence and indolence receive more than their due, each individual will in a short time become his own steward, and a community of goods will be abolished. As soon as distinct ideas of property are formed, it must be unequally distributed; and as soon as property is unequally distributed, there arises an inequality of ranks. Here we have the origin of the depression of the female sex in rude ages, of the tyrannical authority exercised by parents over their children, and perhaps of slavery. The women cannot display the same perseverance, or activity, or address, as the men, in pursuing the chase. They are therefore left at home; and from that moment are no longer equals, but slaves and dependants, who must subsist by the bounty of the males, and must therefore submit with implicit obedience to all their capricious commands. Even before the era of property, the female sex were viewed as inferiors; but till that period they were not reduced to a state of abject slavery.\n\nIn this period of society new notions are formed of the relative duties. Men now become citizens, masters, and servants; husbands, parents, &c. It is impossible to enumerate all the various modes of government which take place among the tribes who have advanced to this stage; but one thing certain is, that the authority of the few over the many is now first established, and that the rise of property first introduces inequality of ranks. In one place, we shall perhaps find the community subjected during this period to the will of a single person; in another, power may be lodged in the hands of a number of chiefs; and in a third, every individual may have a voice in creating public officers, and in enacting laws for the support of public order. But as no code of laws is formed during this period, justice is not very impartially administered, nor are the rights of individuals very faithfully guarded. Many actions, which will afterwards be considered as heinously immoral, are now considered as praiseworthy or indifferent. This is the age of hero-worship, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> and tutelary gods;\nfor it is in this stage of society that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of arts, which gave rise to that worship, contributes most conspicuously to the public good. War, too, which we considered as beginning first to ravage the earth during the former period, and which is another cause of the devastation of dead men, will still prevail in this age, and be carried on with no less ferocity than before, though in a more systematic form.\n\nThe prevalence of war, and the means by which subsistence is procured, cannot but have considerable influence on the character and sentiments of societies and individuals. The hunter and the warrior are characters in many respects different from the shepherd and the husbandman. Such, in point of government, arts, and manners, religious and moral sentiments, were several of the German tribes described by Tacitus; and the Britons whose character has been sketched by the pen of C\u00e6sar: such, too, were the Romans in the early period of their history; such too the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia Minor</a> about the time of the siege of Troy, as well as the Greeks whom Homer celebrates as the destroyers of the Trojan state: the northern tribes also, who poured through Asia, Africa, and Europe, and overthrew the Roman empire, appear to have been of a nearly similar character. It seems to be a general opinion among those who have directed their attention to the history of society, that, in the scale ascending from the lowest condition of human beings to the most civilized and enlightened state of society, the shepherd state is the next in order above the hunting; and that as mankind improve in knowledge and in moral sentiments, and as the forests are gradually depopulated of their inhabitants, instead of destroying the inferior animals, men become their guardians and protectors. But we cannot unreservedly subscribe to this opinion: we believe, that in the shepherd state societies have been sometimes found superior to the most polished tribes of hunters; but upon viewing the annals of mankind in early ages, we observe that there is often no inconsiderable resemblance even between hunters and shepherds in point of the improvement of the rational faculties and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>; and we are therefore led to think, that these two states are sometimes parallel: for instance, several of the American tribes, who still procure their subsistence by hunting, appear to be nearly in the state which we have described as the third stage in the progress of society; and the ancient shepherds of Asia do not appear to have been much more cultivated and refined. We even believe that men have sometimes turned their attention from hunting to agriculture, without passing through any intermediate state. Let us remember, that much depends upon local circumstances, and somewhat undoubtedly on original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> and traditionary instruction. In this period of society the state of the arts well deserves our attention. We shall find, that the shepherds and the hunters are in that respect on a pretty equal footing. Whether we examine the records of ancient history, or view the islands scattered through the South sea, or range the wilds of America, or survey the snowy wastes of Lapland and the frozen coast of Greenland\u2014still we find the useful arts in this period, though known and cultivated, in a very rude state; and the fine arts, or such as are cultivated merely to please the fancy or to gratify caprice, displaying an odd and fantastic, not a true or natural taste; yet this is the period in which eloquence thines with the truest lustre: all is metaphor or glowing sentiment. Languages are not yet copious; and therefore speech is figurative, expressive, and forcible. The tones and gestures of nature, not being yet laid aside, as they generally are, from regard to decorum, in more polished ages, give a degree of force and expression to the harangues of the rustic or savage orator, which the most laborious study of the rules of rhetoric and elocution could not enable even a more polished orator to display.\n\nBut let us advance a little farther, and contemplate our species in a new light, where they will appear with flage; in greater dignity and amiableness of character. Let us view them as husbandmen, artizans, and legislators, whatever circumstances might turn the attention of the arts are any people from hunting to agriculture, or cause the herdman to yoke his oxen for the cultivation of the ground, certain it is that this change in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> would produce a happy change on the character and circumstances of men; it would oblige them to exert a more regular and persevering industry. The hunter is like one of those birds that are described as passing the winter in a torpid state. The shepherd's life is extremely indolent. Neither of these is very favourable to refinement. But different is the condition of the husbandman. His labours succeed each other in regular rotation through the year. Each season with him has its proper employments: he therefore must exert active persevering industry; and in this state we often find the virtues of rude and polished ages united. This is the period where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a> ends and civilization begins. Nations have existed for ages in the hunting or the shepherd state, fixed as by a kind of stagnation, without advancing farther. But scarcely any instances occur in the history of mankind of those who once reached the state of husbandmen, remaining long in that condition without rising to a more civilized and polished state. Where a people turn their attention in any considerable degree to the objects of agriculture, a distinction of occupations naturally arises among them. The husbandman is so closely employed through the several seasons of the year in the labours of the field, that he has no longer leisure to exercise all the rude arts known among his countrymen. He has not time to fashion the instruments of husbandry, to prepare his clothes, to build his house, to manufacture household utensils, or to tend those tame animals which he continues to rear. Those different departments therefore now begin to employ different persons; each of whom dedicates his whole time and attention to his own occupation. The manufacture of cloth is for a considerable time managed exclusively by the women; but smiths and joiners arise from among the men. Metals begin now to be considered as valuable materials. The intercourse of mankind is now placed on a new footing. Before, every individual practised all the arts that were known, as far as was necessary for supplying himself with the conveniences of life. Now he confines himself to one or to a few of them; and, in order to obtain a necessary supply of the productions of those arts which he does not cultivate himself, he gives in exchange a part of the productions of his own labours. Here we have the origin of commerce.\n\nAfter continuing perhaps for some time in this state, as arts and distinctions multiply in society, the exchange...\nSociety. change of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> for another is found troublesome and inconvenient. It is ingeniously contrived to adopt a medium of commerce, which being eliminated not by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value, but by a certain nominal value which it receives from the agreement of the society among whom it is used, serves to render the exchange of property, which is so necessary for the purposes of social life, easy and expeditions. Wherever metals have been known, they appear to have been adopted as the medium of commerce almost as soon as such a medium began to be used; and this is one important purpose for which they serve; but they have still more important uses. Almost all the necessary arts depend on them. Where the metals are known, agriculture practised, and the necessary arts distributed among different orders of artisans\u2014civilization and refinement, if not obstructed by some accidental circumstances, advance with a rapid progress. With regard to the first applying of the precious metals as the medium of commerce, we may observe, that this was probably not accomplished by means of a formal contract. They might be first used as ornaments; and the love of ornament, which prevails among rude as much as among civilized nations, would render every one willing to receive them in exchange for such articles as he could spare. Such might be the change produced on society with regard to the necessary arts by the origin of agriculture. As soon as ornament and amusement are thought of, the fine arts begin to be cultivated. In their origin therefore they are not long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to the necessary and useful arts. They appear long before men reach the comfortable and respectable condition of husbandmen; but so rude is their character at their first origin, that our Dilettanti would probably view the productions of that period with unspeakable contempt and disgust. But in the period of society which we now consider, they have aspired to a higher character; yet poetry is now perhaps less generally cultivated than during the shepherd state. Agriculture, considered by itself, is not directly favourable either to refinement of manners or to the fine arts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of shepherds is generally supposed to be far more elegant than that of husbandmen; but though the direct and immediate effects of this condition of life be not favourable to the fine arts, yet indirectly it has a strong tendency to promote their improvement. Its immediate influence is extremely favourable to the necessary and useful arts; and there are no less favourable to the fine arts.\n\nOne of the noblest changes which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of the arts by agriculture produces on the form and circumstances of society, is the introduction of regular government and laws. In tracing the history of ancient nations, we scarcely ever find laws introduced at an earlier period. Minos, Solon, and Lycurgus, do not appear to have formed codes of wisdom and justice for regulating the manners of their countrymen, till after the Cretans, the Athenians, and even the Lacedemonians, had made some progress in agriculture and the useful arts.\n\nReligion, under all its various forms, has in every stage of society a mighty influence on the sentiments and conduct of men (see Religion); and the arts cultivated in society have on the other hand some influence on the system of religious belief. One happy effect which will result from the invention of arts, though perhaps not immediately, will be, to render the character of the deities more benevolent and amiable, and the rites of their worship more mild and humane.\n\nThe female sex in this period generally find the yoke of their slavery somewhat lightened. Men now become easier in their circumstances; the social affections assume stronger influence over the mind; plenty, and security, and ease, at once communicate both delicacy and keenness to the sensual delights. All these circumstances concur to make men relax in some degree that tyranny sway by which they before depressed the softer sex. The foundation of that empire, where beauty triumphs over both wisdom and strength, now begins to be laid. Such are the effects which history warrants as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to agriculture and the arts; and such the outlines of the character of that which we reckon the fourth stage in the progress of society from rudeness to refinement.\n\nLet us advance one step farther. We have not yet surveyed mankind in their most polished and cultivated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> state. Society is rude at the period when the arts first begin to show themselves, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of that state which it is raised by the industrious cultivation of literature. The neighbouring commonwealths of Athens and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a> afford us a happy opportunity of comparing this with the former stage in the progress of fo-\n\nLycurgus seems to have been, to fix the manners of his countrymen for a considerable period in that state to which they had attained in his days. Spartan virtue has been admired and extolled in the language of enthusiasm; but in the same manner has the character and the condition of the savage inhabitants of the wilds of America, been preferred by some philosophers, to the virtues and the enjoyments of social life in the most polished and enlightened state. The Spartans in the days of Lycurgus had begun to cultivate the ground, and were not unacquainted with the useful arts. They must soon have advanced farther had not Lycurgus arisen, and by effecting the establishment of a code of laws, the tendency of which appears to have been in many particulars directly opposite to the designs of nature, retarded their progress towards complete civilization and refinement. The history of the Lacedemonians, therefore, while the laws of Lycurgus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in force, exhibits the manners and character of a people in that which we have denominated the fourth stage in the progress of society. But if we turn our eyes to their neighbours the Athenians, we behold in their history the natural progress of opinions, arts, and manners. The useful arts are first cultivated with such steady industry, as to raise the community to opulence, and to furnish them with articles for commerce with foreign nations. The useful arts cannot be raised to this height of improvement without leading men to the pursuit of science. Commerce with foreign nations, skill in the useful arts, and a taste for science, mutually aid each other, and conspire to promote the improvement of the fine arts. Hence magnificent buildings, noble statues, paintings expressive of life, action, and passion; and poems in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> adds new grace and sublimity to nature, and gives the appearances of social life more irresistible power over the affections of the heart. Hence are moral distinctions more carefully studied, and the\nSociety the rights of every individual and every order in society better understood and more accurately defined. Moral science is generally the first scientific pursuit which strongly attracts the attention of men. Lawgivers appear before geometers and astronomers. Some particular circumstances may cause these sciences to be cultivated at a very early period. In Egypt the overflowing of the Nile caused geometry to be early cultivated. Causes no less favourable to the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, concurred to recommend that science to the attention of the Chaldeans long before they had attained the height of refinement. But, in general, we find, that the laws of morality are understood, and the principles of morals inquired into, before men make any considerable progress in physical science, or even prosecute it with any degree of keenness. Accordingly, when we view the state of literature in this period (for it is now become an object of so much importance as to force itself on our attention), we perceive that poetry, history, and morals, are the branches chiefly cultivated. Arts are generally casual inventions, and long practised before rules and principles on which they are founded assume the form of science. But morality, if considered as an art, is that art which men have soonest and most constantly occasion to practise. Besides, we are so constituted by the wisdom of nature, that human actions, and the events which befell human beings, have more powerful influence than any other object to engage and fix our attention. Hence we are enabled to explain why morality, and those branches of literature more immediately connected with it, are almost always cultivated in preference to physical science. Though poetry, history, and morals, be pursued with no small eagerness and success in that period of society which we now consider, we need not therefore be greatly surprized that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a> is neither very generally nor very successfully cultivated. Were we to consider each particular in that happy change which is now produced on the circumstances of mankind, we should be led into a too minute and perhaps unimportant detail. This is the period when human virtue and human abilities shine with most splendour. Rudeness, ferocity, and barbarism, are now banished. Luxury has made her appearance; but as yet she is the friend and the benefactor of society. Commerce has stimulated and rewarded industry, but has not yet contracted the heart and debased the character. Wealth is not yet become the sole object of pursuit. The charms of social intercourse are known and relished; but domestic duties are not yet deserted for public amusements. The female sex acquire new influence, and contribute much to refine and polish the manners of their lords. Religion now assumes a milder and more pleasing form; splendid rites, magnificent temples, pompous sacrifices, and gay festivals, give even superstition an influence favourable to the happiness of mankind. The gloomy notions and barbarous rites of former periods fall into disuse. The system of theology produced in former ages still remains: but only the mild and amiable qualities of the deities are celebrated; and none but the gay, humane, and laughing divinities, are worshipped. Philosophy also teaches men to discard such parts of their religion as are unfriendly to good morals, and have any tendency to call forth or cherish unsocial sentiments in the heart. War (for in this period of society enough of causes will arise to arm one nation against another)\u2014war, however, no longer retains its former ferocity; nations no longer strive to extirpate one another: to procure redress for real or imaginary injuries; to humble, not to destroy, is now its object. Prisoners are no longer murdered in cold blood, subjected to horrid and excruciating tortures, or condemned to hopeless slavery. They are ransomed or exchanged; they return to their country, and again fight under its banners. In this period the arts of government are likewise better understood, and practised so as to contribute most to the interests of society. Whether monarchy, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOCRACY\">aristocracy</a>, be the established form, the rights of individuals and of society are in general respected. The interests of society are so well understood, that the few, in order to preserve their influence over the many, find it necessary to act rather as the faithful servants than the imperious lords of the public. Though the liberties of a nation in this state be not accurately defined by law, nor their property guaranteed to them by any legal institutions, yet their governors dare not violate their liberties, nor deprive them wantonly of their properties. This is truly the golden age of society: every trace of barbarism is entirely effaced; and vicious luxury has not yet begun to sap the virtue and the happiness of the community. Men live not in little's indolence; but the industry in which they are engaged is not of such a nature as to overpower their strength or exhaust their spirits. The social affections have now the strongest influence on men's sentiments and conduct.\n\nBut human affairs are scarcely ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>. The circumstances of mankind are almost always changing, and decline either growing better or worse. Their manners are ever of society, in the same fluctuating state. They either advance towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> or degenerate. Scarcely have they attained that happy period in which we have just contemplated them, when they begin to decline till they perhaps fall back into a state nearly as low as that from which we suppose them to have emerged. Influences of this unhappy degeneracy occur more than once in the history of mankind; and we may finish this short sketch of the history of society by mentioning in what manner this degeneracy takes place. Perhaps, strictly speaking, every thing but the simple necessaries of life may be denominated luxury: For a long time, however, the welfare of society is best promoted, while its members aspire after something more than the mere necessaries of life. As long as these superfluities are to be obtained only by active and honest exertion; as long as they only engage the leisure hours, without becoming the chief objects of pursuit\u2014the employment which they give to the faculties is favourable both to the virtue and the happiness of the human race.\n\nThe period arrives, however, when luxury is no longer serviceable to the interests of nations; when she is no longer a graceful, elegant, active form, but a languid, overgrown, and bloated carcass. It is the love of luxury, which contributed so much to the civilization of society, that now brings on its decline. Arts are cultivated and improved, and commerce extended, till enormous opulence be acquired: the effect of opulence is to awaken the fancy, to conceive ideas of new and capricious wants, and to inflame the breast with new desires. Here we have the origin of that selfishness which, operating in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with caprice and the violence of...\nunbridled passions, contributes so much to the corruption of virtuous manners. Selfishness, caprice, indolence, effeminacy, all join to loosen the bonds of society, to bring on the degeneracy both of the useful and the fine arts, to banish at once the mild and the austere virtues, to destroy civil order and subordination, and to introduce in their room anarchy or despotism.\n\nScarcely could we have found an example of the beautiful form of society which we last attempted to describe. Never, at least, has any nation continued long to enjoy such happy circumstances, or to display so amiable and respectable a character. But when we speak of the declining state of society, we have no difficulty in finding instances to which we may refer. History tells of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Persians, all of them once flourishing nations, but brought low by luxury and an unhappy corruption of manners. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Assyrians, owed their fall to the same causes; and we know not if a similar fate does not now threaten many of those nations who have long made a distinguished figure in the system of Europe. The Portuguese, the Venetians, and the Spaniards, have already fallen; and what is the present state of our neighbours the French? They have long been a people destitute of religion, corrupted in morals, unfeeling in conduct, and slaves to pleasure and public amusements. Among them luxury had arrived at its highest pitch; and the consequence has been, that after capriciously shaking off the yoke of despotism, they have established, or rather set up (for established it cannot be), a motley kind of government, which, in the course of a few years, has exhibited scenes of tyranny and oppression, to which we doubt if the annals of the world can furnish any parallel. Yet this is the people whose manners the other nations of Europe were ambitious to imitate. May those nations take warning in time, and avoid the rocks upon which they have split.\n\nThus have we viewed the several stages in which society appears in its progress from rudeness to refinement and decay. The intelligent reader will perceive, that the various and anomalous phenomena which occur in the natural history of society, cannot easily be solved; because the necessary information cannot be obtained. Others have been well accounted for by the researches of curious philosophical inquirers. Local circumstances, the influence of climate, the intercourse of nations in different states of civilization, have been taken notice of, as causes serving to accelerate or retard the progress of arts and manners. But our proper business here was merely to mark the gradations between barbarism and refinement; and as the painter who is to exhibit a series of portraits representing the human form in infancy, puerility, youth, and manhood, will not think of delineating all that variety of figures and faces which each of those periods of life affords, and will find himself unable to represent in any single figure all diversities of form and features; so we have not once thought of describing particularly under this article, all the various national characters reducible to any one of those divisions under which we have viewed the progress of society, nor have found it possible to comprehend under one consistent view, all the particulars which may be gathered from the remains of antiquity, from the relations of later travellers, and the general records of history concerning the progressive character of mankind in various regions, and under the influence of various accidents and circumstances. This indeed would even have been improper, as all that information appears under other articles in this Work.","sp":41,"ep":48},{"h":"SOCINIANS","t":"in Church-History, a sect of Christian heretics, so called from their founder Faustus Socinus (see Socinus).

They deny the doctrines of satisfaction and imputed righteousness; and say that Christ only preached the truth to mankind, set before them in himself an example of heroic virtue, and sealed his doctrines with his blood.

Modern Unitarianism, as taught by Dr Priestley, is, however, a very different thing from Socinianism, as we find it in the Racovian catechism and other standard works of the sect.

He by this means became acquainted with the most learned men of his time, who testified by their letters the esteem they had for him: but as he discovered to them his doubts, he was greatly suspected of heresy. He, however, conducted himself with such address, that he lived among the capital enemies of his opinions, without receiving the least injury. He met with some disciples, who heard his instructions with respect; these were Italians who left their native country on account of religion, and wandered about in Germany and Poland. He communicated likewise his sentiments to his relations by his writings, which he caused to be conveyed to them at Sienna. He died at Zurich in 1562.

He returned to Tuscany; and made himself agreeable to the grand duke, that the charms which he found in that court, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> posts he filled there, hindered him for twelve years from remembering that he had been considered as the person who was to put the last hand to the system of fanatical divinity, of which his uncle L\u00e6lius had made a rough draught. At last he went into Germany in 1574, and paid no regard to the grand duke's advices to return. He stayed three years at Basle, and studied divinity there, and having adopted a set of principles very different from the system of Protestants, he resolved to maintain and propagate them; for which purpose he wrote a treatise De Iesu Christo Servatore. In 1579 Socinus retired into Poland, and desired to be admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNITARIANS\">Unitarians</a>; but as he differed from them in some points, on which he refused to be silent, he met with a repulse. However, he did not cease to write in defence of their churches against those who attacked them. At length his book against James Paleologus furnished his enemies with a pretence to exasperate the king of Poland against him; but though the mere reading of it was sufficient to refute his accusers, Socinus thought proper to leave Cracow, after having resided there four years. He then lived under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of several Polish lords, and married a lady of a good family; but her death, which happened in 1587, so deeply afflicted him as to injure his health; and to complete his sorrow, he was deprived of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a> by the death of Francis de Medicis, great duke of Florence. The consolation he found in feeling his sentiments at last approved by several ministers, was greatly interrupted in 1598; for he met with a thousand insults at Cracow, and was with great difficulty saved from the hands of the rabble. His house was plundered, and he lost his goods; but this loss was not to uneasy to him as that of some manuscripts, which he extremely regretted. To deliver himself from such dangers, he retired to a village about nine miles distant from Cracow, where he spent the remainder of his days at the house of Abraham Blonki, a Polish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, and died there in 1604.

His parents were of low rank; his father Sophroniscus being a flaxworker, and his mother Phaenareta a midwife. Sophroniscus brought up his son, contrary to his inclination, in his own manual employment; in which Socrates, though his mind was continually aspiring after higher objects, was not unsuccessful, for whilst he was a young man, he is said to have formed statues of the habited Graces, which were allowed a place in the citadel of Athens. Upon the death of his father he was left in such straitened circumstances as laid him under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of exercising that art to procure the means of subsistence, though he devoted, at the same time, all the leisure which he could command, to the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. His distress, however, was soon relieved by Crito, a wealthy Athenian; who, remarking his strong propensity to study, and admiring his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> disposition and distinguished abilities, generously took him under his patronage, and intrusted him with the instruction of his children. The opportunities which Socrates by this means enjoyed of attending the public lectures of the most eminent philosophers, so far increased his thirst after wisdom, that he determined to relinquish his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a>, and every prospect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> which that might afford, in order to devote himself entirely to his favourite pursuits. Under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a> and Archelaus he prosecuted the study of nature in the usual manner of the philosophers of the age, and became well acquainted with their doctrines. Prodicus the sophist was his preceptor in eloquence, Evenus in poetry, Thedorus in geometry, and Damo in music. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCIBIADES\">Alcibiades</a>, a woman no less celebrated for her intellectual than her personal accomplishments, whose house was frequented by the most celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, had also some share in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of Socrates. Under such preceptors it cannot reasonably be doubted but that he became master of every kind of learning which the age in which he lived could afford; and being blessed with very uncommon talents by nature, he appeared in Athens, under the respectable characters of a good citizen and a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. Being called upon by his country to take arms in the long and severe struggle between Athens and Sparta, he signalized himself at the siege of Potidea, both by his valour and by the hardiness with which he endured fatigue. During the severity of a Thracian winter, whilst others were clad in furs, he wore only his usual clothing, and walked barefoot upon the ice. In an engagement in which he saw Alcibiades falling down wounded, he advanced to defend him, and saved both him and his arms: and though the prize of valour was on this occasion unquestionably due to Socrates, he generously gave his vote that it might be bestowed upon Alcibiades, to encourage his rising merit. He served in other campaigns with distinguished bravery, and had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> on one occasion to save the life of Xenophon, by bearing him, when covered with wounds, out of the reach of the enemy.\n\nIt was not till Socrates was upwards of 60 years of age that he undertook to serve his country in any civil office, when he was chosen to represent his own district, in the senate of five hundred. In this office, though he at first exposed himself to some degree of ridicule from the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in the forms of business, he soon convinced his colleagues that he was superior to them all in wisdom and integrity. Whilst they, intimidated by the clamours of the populace, passed an unjust sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> upon the commanders, who, after the engagement at the Arginian islands, had been prevented by a storm from paying funeral honours to the dead, Socrates stood forth singly in their defence, and to the last refused to give his suffrage against them, declaring that no force should compel him to act contrary to justice and the laws. Under the subsequent tyranny he never ceased to condemn the oppressive and cruel proceedings of the thirty tyrants; and when his boldness provoked their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, so that his life was in hazard, fearing neither treachery nor violence, he still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to support with undaunted firmness the rights of his fellow citizens.\n\nHaving given these proofs of public virtue both in a military and civil capacity, he wished to do still more for his country. Observing with regret how much the opinions of the Athenian youth were misled, and their principles and taste corrupted by philosophers who spent all their time in refined speculations upon nature and the origin of things, and by sophists who taught in their schools the arts of false eloquence and deceitful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>; Socrates formed the wise and generous design of instituting a new and more useful method of instruction. He justly conceived the true end of philosophy to be, not to make an ostentatious display of superior learning and ability in futile disputations or ingenious conjectures, but to free mankind from the dominion of pernicious prejudices; to correct their vices; to inspire them with the love of virtue; and thus conduct them in the path of wisdom to true felicity. He therefore assumed the character of a moral philosopher; and, looking upon the whole city of Athens as his school, and all who were disposed to lend him their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> as his pupils, he seized every occasion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> moral wisdom to his fellow citizens. He passed the greater part of his time in public; and the method of instruction of which he chiefly made use was, to propose a series of questions to the person with whom he conversed, in order to lead him to some unforeseen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>. He first gained the consent of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESPONDENT\">respondent</a> to some obvious truths, and then obliged him to admit others from their relation or resemblance to those to which he had already assented. Without making use of any direct argument or persuasion, he chose to lead the person he meant to instruct, to deduce the truths of which he wished to convince him, as a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> from his own conceptions. He commonly conducted these conferences with such address, as to conceal his design till the respondent had advanced too far to recede. On some occasions he made use of ironical language, that vain men might be caught in their own replies, and be obliged to confess their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>. He never assumed the air of a morose and rigid preceptor, but communicated useful instruction with all the ease and pleasantry of polite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>. Though eminently furnished with every kind of learning, he preferred moral to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> wisdom. Convinced that philosophy\nSocrates. Philosophy is valuable, not as it furnishes questions for the schools, but as it provides men with a law of life, he censured his predecessors for spending all their time in abstract researches into nature, and taking no pains to render themselves useful to mankind. His favorite maxim was, Whatever is above us doth not concern us. He estimated the value of knowledge by its utility, and recommended the study of geometry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and other sciences, only so far as they admit of a practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the purposes of human life. His great object in all his conferences and discourses was, to lead men into an acquaintance with themselves; to convince them of their follies and vices; to inspire them with the love of virtue; and to furnish them with useful moral instructions. Cicero might therefore very justly say of Socrates, that he was the first who called down philosophy from heaven to earth, and introduced her into the public walks and domestic retirements of men, that she might instruct them concerning life and manners.\n\nThrough his whole life this good man discovered a mind superior to the attractions of wealth and power. Contrary to the general practice of the preceptors of his time, he instructed his pupils without receiving from them any gratuity. He frequently refused rich presents, which were offered him by Alcibiades and others, though importunately urged to accept them by his wife. The chief men of Athens were his stewards: they sent him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, as they apprehended he wanted them; he took what his present wants required, and returned the rest. Observing the numerous articles of luxury which were exposed to sale in Athens, he exclaimed, \"How many things are there which I do not want!\" With Socrates, moderation supplied the place of wealth. In his clothing and food, he consulted only the demands of nature. He commonly appeared in a neat but plain cloak, with his feet uncovered. Though his table was only supplied with simple fare, he did not scruple to invite men of superior rank to partake of his meals; and when his wife, upon some such occasion, expressed her dissatisfaction on being no better provided, he desired her to give herself no concern; for if his guests were wise men, they would be contented with whatever they found at his table; if otherwise, they were unworthy of notice. Whilst others, says he, live to eat, wise men eat to live.\n\nThough Socrates was exceedingly unfortunate in his domestic connection, he converted this infelicity into an occasion of exercising his virtues. Xantippe, concerning whose ill humour ancient writers relate many amusing tales, was certainly a woman of a high and unmanageable spirit. But Socrates while he endeavored to curb the violence of her temper, improved his own. When Alcibiades expressed his surprise that his friend could bear to live in the same house with so perverse and quarrelsome a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, Socrates replied, that being daily inured to ill humour at home, he was the better prepared to encounter perverseness and injury abroad.\n\nIn the midst of domestic vexations and public disorders, Socrates retained such an unruffled serenity, that he was never seen either to leave his own house or to return home with a disturbed countenance. In acquiring this entire dominion over his passions and appetites, he had the greater merit, as it was not effected without a violent struggle against his natural propensities. Zopyrus, an eminent physiognomist, declared, that he discovered in the features of the philosopher evident traces of many vicious inclinations. The friends of Socrates who were present ridiculed the ignorance of this pretender to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> sagacity. But Socrates himself ingenuously acknowledged his penetration, and confessed that he was in his natural disposition prone to vice, but that he had subdued his inclinations by the power of reason and philosophy.\n\nThrough the whole of his life Socrates gave himself up to the guidance of unbiased reason, which is supposed by some to be all that he meant by the genius or daemon from which he professed to receive instruction. But this opinion is inconsistent with the accounts given by his followers of that daemon, and even with the language in which he spoke of it himself. Plato sometimes calls it his guardian, and Apuleius his god; and as Xenophon attests that it was the belief of his master that the gods occasionally communicate to men the knowledge of future events, it is by means improbable that Socrates admitted, with the generality of his countrymen, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of those intermediate beings called daemons, of one of which he might fancy himself the peculiar care.\n\nIt was one of the maxims of Socrates, \"That a wise man will worship the gods according to the institutions of the state to which he belongs.\" Convinced of the weakness of the human understanding, and perceiving that the pride of philosophy had led his predecessors into futile speculations on the nature and origin of things, he judged it most consistent with true wisdom to speak with caution and reverence concerning the divine nature.\n\nThe wisdom and the virtues of this great man, whilst they procured him many followers, created him also many enemies. The Sophists*, whose knavery and ignorance he took every opportunity of exposing to public contempt, became inveterate in their enmity against so bold a reformer, and devised an expedient, by which they hoped to check the current of his popularity. They engaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOPHANES\">Aristophanes</a>, the first buffoon of the age, to write a comedy, in which Socrates should be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> character. Aristophanes, pleased with so promising an occasion of displaying his low and malignant wit, undertook the task, and produced the comedy of The Clouds, still extant in his works. In this piece, Socrates is introduced hanging in a basket in the air, and thence pouring forth absurdity and profaneness. But the philosopher, showing in a crowded theatre that he was wholly unmoved by this ribaldry, the satire failed of its effect; and when Aristophanes attempted the year following to renew the piece with alterations and additions, the representation was so much discouraged, that he was obliged to discontinue it.\n\nFrom this time Socrates continued for many years to pursue without interruption his laudable design of instructing and reforming his fellow-citizens. At length, however, when the inflexible integrity with which he had discharged the duty of a senator, and the firmness with which he had opposed every kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> corruption and oppression, had greatly increased the number of his enemies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLANDESTINE\">clandestine</a> arts were employed to raise a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> against him. The people were industriously reminded, that Critias, who had been one of the most cruel of the thirty tyrants, and Alcibiades, who\nSocrates, who had insulted religion, by defacing the public statues of Mercury, and performing a mock representation of the Eleusinian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a>, had in their youth been disciples of Socrates; and the minds of the populace being thus prepared, a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> was preferred against him before the supreme court of judicature. His accusers were Anytus a leather-dresser, who had long entertained a personal enmity against Socrates, for reprehending his avarice, in depriving his sons of the benefits of learning, that they might pursue the gains of trade; Melitus, a young rhetorician, who was capable of undertaking any thing for the sake of gain; and Lycon, who was glad of any opportunity of displaying his talents. The accusation, which was delivered to the senate under the name of Melius, was this: \"Melius, son of Melius, of the tribe of Pythos, accuseth Socrates, son of Sophroniscus, of the tribe of Alopece. Socrates violates the laws, in not acknowledging the gods which the state acknowledges, and by introducing new divinities. He also violates the laws by corrupting the youth. Be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> death.\"\n\nThis charge was delivered upon oath to the senate; and Crito a friend of Socrates became surety for his appearance on the day of trial. Anytus soon afterwards sent a private message to Socrates, assuring him that if he would desist from censuring his conduct, he would withdraw his accusation. But Socrates refused to comply with so degrading a condition; and with his usual spirit replied, \"Whilst I live I will never disguise the truth, nor speak otherwise than my duty requires.\" The interval between the accusation and the trial he spent in philosophical conversations with his friends, choosing to discourse upon any other subject rather than his own situation.\n\nWhen the day of trial arrived, his accusers appeared in the senate, and attempted to support their charge in three distinct speeches, which strongly marked their respective characters. Plato, who was a young man, and a zealous follower of Socrates, then rose up to address the judges in defence of his master; but whilst he was attempting to apologise for his youth, he was abruptly commanded by the court to sit down. Socrates, however needed no advocate. Ascending the chair with all the ferocity of conscious innocence, and with all the dignity of superior merit, he delivered, in a firm and manly tone, an unpremeditated defence of himself, which silenced his opponents, and ought to have convinced his judges. After tracing the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> which had been raised against him to its true source, the jealousy and resentment of men whose ignorance he had exposed, and whose vices he had ridiculed and reproved, he distinctly replied to the several charges brought against him by Melitus. To prove that he had not been guilty of impiety towards the gods of his country, he appealed to his frequent practice of attending the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> festivals. The crime of introducing new divinities, with which he was charged, chiefly as it seems on the ground of the admonitions which he professed to have received from an invisible power, he disclaimed, by pleading that it was no new thing for men to consult the gods and receive instructions from them. To refute the charge of his having been a corrupter of youth, he urged the example which he had uniformly exhibited of justice, moderation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>; the moral spirit and tendency of his discourses; and the effect which had actually been produced by his doctrine upon the manners of the young. Then, disdaining to solicit the mercy of his judges, he called upon them for that justice which their office and their oath obliged them to administer; and professing his faith and confidence in God, resigned himself to their pleasure.\n\nThe judges, whose prejudices would not suffer them to pay due attention to this apology, or to examine with impartiality the merits of the cause, immediately declared him guilty of the crimes of which he stood accused. Socrates, in this stage of the trial, had a right to enter his plea against the punishment which the accusers demanded, and instead of the sentence of death, to propose some pecuniary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERCEMENT\">amercement</a>. But he at first peremptorily refused to make any proposal of this kind, imagining that it might be construed into an acknowledgment of guilt; and asserted, that his conduct merited from the state reward rather than punishment. At length, however, he was prevailed upon by his friends to offer upon their credit a fine of thirty mina. The judges, notwithstanding, still remained inexorable: they proceeded, without farther delay, to pronounce sentence upon him; and he was condemned to be put to death by the poison of hemlock.\n\nThe sentence being passed, he was sent to prison; which, says Seneca, he entered with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> and firmness with which he had opposed the thirty tyrants; and took away all ignominy from the place, which could not be a prison while he was there. He lay in fetters 30 days; and was constantly visited by Crito, Plato, and other friends, with whom he passed the time in dispute after his usual manner. Anxious to save so valuable a life, they urged him to attempt his escape, or at least to permit them to convey him away; and Crito went so far, as to assure him that, by his interest with the jailor, it might be easily accomplished, and to offer him a retreat in Thessaly; but Socrates rejected the proposal, as a criminal violation of the laws; and asked them, whether there was any place out of Attica which death could not reach.\n\nAt length the day arrived when the officers to whose care he was committed delivered to Socrates early in the morning the final order for his execution, and immediately, according to the law, fet him at liberty from his bonds. His friends, who came thus early to the prison that they might have an opportunity of conversing with their master through the day, found his wife sitting by him with a child in her arms. Socrates, that the tranquillity of his last moments might not be disturbed by her unavailing lamentations, requested that she might be conducted home. With the most frantic expressions of grief she left the prison. An interesting conversation then passed between Socrates and his friends, which chiefly turned upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the soul. In the course of this conversation, he expressed his disapprobation of the practice of suicide, and assured his friends that his chief support in his present situation was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, though not unmixed with doubts, of a happy existence after death. \"It would be inexcusable in me (said he) to despise death, if I were not persuaded that it will conduct me into the presence of the gods, who are the most righteous governors, and into the society of just and good men; but I derive confidence from the hope that something of man remains after death,\"\ndeath, and that the condition of good men will then be much better than that of the bad.\" Crito afterwards asked him, in what manner he wished to be buried? Socrates replied, with a smile, \"As you please, provided I do not escape out of your hands.\" Then, turning to the rest of his friends, he said, \"Is it not strange, after all that I have said to convince you that I am going to the society of the happy, that Crito still thinks that this body, which will soon be a lifeless corpse, is Socrates? Let him dispose of my body as he pleases, but let him not at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a> mourn over it as if it were Socrates.\"\n\nTowards the close of the day he retired into an adjoining apartment to bathe; his friends, in the meantime, expressing to one another their grief at the prospect of losing so excellent a father, and being left to pass the rest of their days in the solitary state of orphans. After a short interval, during which he gave some necessary instructions to his domestics, and took his last leave of his children, the attendant of the prison informed him, that the time for drinking the poison was come. The executioner, though accustomed to such scenes, shed tears as he presented the fatal cup. Socrates received it without change of countenance or the least appearance of perturbation: then offering up a prayer to the gods that they would grant him a prosperous passage into the invisible world, with perfect composure he swallowed the poisonous draught. His friends around him burst into tears. Socrates alone remained unmoved. He upbraided their pusillanimity, and entreated them to exercise a manly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> worthy of the friends of virtue. He continued walking till the chilling operation of the hemlock obliged him to lie down upon his bed. After remaining for a short time silent, he requested Crito (probably in order to refute a calumny which might prove injurious to his friends after his decease) not to neglect the offering of a cock which he had vowed to Eucalypus. Then, covering himself with his cloak, he expired. Such was the fate of the virtuous Socrates! A story, says Cicero, which I never read without tears.\n\nThe friends and disciples of this illustrious teacher of wisdom were deeply afflicted by his death, and attended his funeral with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of grief. Apprehensive, however, for their own safety, they soon afterwards privately withdrew from the city, and took up their residence in distant places. Several of them visited the philosopher Euclid of Megara, by whom they were kindly received. No sooner was the unjust condemnation of Socrates known through Greece, than a general indignation was kindled in the minds of good men, who universally regretted that so distinguished an advocate for virtue should have fallen a sacrifice to jealousy and envy. The Athenians themselves, so remarkable for their caprice, who never knew the value of their great men till after their death, soon became sensible of the folly as well as criminality of putting to death the man who had been the chief ornament of their city and of the age, and turned their indignation against his accusers. Melitus was condemned to death; and Anytus, to escape a similar fate, went into voluntary exile. To give a farther proof of the sincerity of their regret, the Athenians for a while interrupted public business; decreed a general mourning; recalled the exiled friends of Socrates; and erected a statue to his memory in one of the most frequented parts of the city. Socrates' death happened in the fifth year of the 96th olympiad, and in the 70th year of his age.\n\nSocrates left behind him nothing in writing; but his illustrious pupils Xenophon and Plato have in some measure supplied this defect. The Memoirs of Socrates, written by Xenophon, afford, however, a much more accurate idea of the opinions of Socrates, and of his manner of teaching, than the Dialogues of Plato, who everywhere mixes his own conceptions and dictum with the ideas and language of his master. It is related, that when Socrates heard Plato recite his Lyfs, he said, \"How much does this young man make me say which I never conceived?\"\n\nHis distinguishing character was that of a moral philosopher; and his doctrine concerning God and religion was rather practical than speculative. But he did not neglect to build the structure of religious faith upon the firm foundation of an appeal to natural appearances: He taught, that the Supreme Being, though invisible, is clearly seen in his works; which at once demonstrate his existence and his wise and benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>. He admitted, besides the one Supreme Deity, the existence of beings who possess a middle station between God and man, to whose immediate agency he ascribed the ordinary phenomena of nature, and whom he supposed to be particularly concerned in the management of human affairs. Hence he declared it to be the duty of every one, in the performance of religious rites, to follow the customs of his country. At the same time, he taught, that the merit of all religious offerings depends upon the character of the worshipper, and that the gods take pleasure in the sacrifices of none but the truly pious.\n\nConcerning the human soul, the opinion of Socrates, according to Xenophon, was, that it is allied to the Divine Being, not by a participation of essence, but by a similarity of nature; that man excels all other animals in the faculty of reason; and that the existence of good men will be continued after death in a state in which they will receive the reward of their virtue. Although it appears that on this latter topic he was not wholly free from uncertainty, the consolation which he professed to derive from this source in the immediate prospect of death, leaves little room to doubt that he entertained a real expectation of immortality: and there is reason to believe that he was the only philosopher of ancient Greece whose principles admitted of such an expectation (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">METAPHYSICS</a>, Part III. Chap.iv.). Of his moral system, which was in a high degree pure, and founded on the surest basis, the reader will find a short view in our article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">MORAL PHILOSOPHY</a>, No. 4.\n\nSOCRATES was also the name of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> historian of the 5th century, born at Constantinople in the beginning of the reign of Theodosius: he professed the law and pleaded at the bar, whence he obtained the name of Scholasticus.

Concerning the origin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this word, very different opinions have been formed by the learned. Buchanan (lib. i. cap. 34.) says, that before his time the name of Sodor was given to a town in the Isle of Man. In Gough's edition of Camden's Britannia (vol. iii. p. 701,) it is said, that after the Isle of Man was annexed to the crown of England, this appellation was given to a small island within mucket-thot of Man, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> stands, called by the Norwegians the Holm, and by the inhabitants the Peel. In support of this opinion a charter is quoted A.D. 1505, in which Thomas earl of Derby and lord of Man confirms to Huon Heketh bishop of Sodor all the lands, &c. anciently belonging to the bishops of Man. \"Ecclesiam cathedralem sancti Germani in Holm Sodor vel Pele vocatam, ecclesiam sancti Patricii ibidem, et locum praefatum in quo ecclesia praefata fita fuit.\" The truth of either, or perhaps of both, these accounts might be allowed; but neither of them is sufficient to account for the constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> of Sodor and Man, in charters, registers, and histories. If Sodor was a small town or island belonging to Man, it cannot be conceived why it is always mentioned before it, or rather why it should be mentioned at all in speaking of a bishop's diocese. To speak of the bishopric of Sodor and Man in this case would be as improper as it would be to call the bishopric of Durham the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOLY_ISLAND\">Holy Island</a> and Durham, or the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DARLINGTON\">Darlington</a> and Durham; the former being a small island and the latter a town belonging to the county and diocese of Durham. Neither of these accounts, therefore, gives a satisfactory account of the original conjunction of Sodor and Man.\n\nThe island of Iona was the place where the bishop of the Isles resided, the cathedral church of which, it is said, was dedicated to our Saviour, in Greek Soter, hence Sotorfenfer, which might be corrupted into Sodorfenfer, a name frequently given by Danish writers to the western isles of Scotland. That we may be the more disposed to accede to this Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for this opinion tell us, that the name Icolmkill, which is often applied to this island, is also of Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, being derived from Columba, \"a pigeon;\" a meaning that exactly corresponds to the Celtic word Colum and the Hebrew word Iona. We must confess, however, that we have very little faith in the conjectures of etymologists, and think that upon no occasion they alone can establish any fact, though when concurring with facts they certainly tend to confirm and explain them. It is only from historical facts that we can know to what Sodor was applied.\n\nIt appears from the history of the Orkneys, compiled by an old Icelandic writer, translated and enlarged by Torfaes, that the \u00c6bude or Western isles of Scotland were divided into two clusters, Nordureys and Sudereys. The Nordureys, which were separated from the Sudereys by the point of Ardnamurchan, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ARGYLESHIRE\">Argyleshire</a>, consisted of Muck, Egg, Rum, Canna, Skye, Raay, Barra, South Uist, North Uist, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BENBECULA\">Benbecula</a>, and Lewis, including Harris, with a great number of small isles. The Sudereys were, Man, Arran, Bute, Cumra, Avon, Gid, Ila, Colonfay, Jura, Scarba, Mull, Iona, Tiree, Coll, Ulva, and other small islands. All these, when joined together, and subject to the same prince, made up the kingdom of Man and the Isles. In the Norwegian language, Suder and Norder signify southern and northern, and ey or ay an island. When the \u00c6bude were under one monarch, the seat of empire was fixed in the Sudereys, and the Nordureys were governed by deputies; hence the former are much oftener mentioned in history than the latter; hence, too, the Sudereys often comprehend the Nordureys, as in our days Scotland is sometimes comprehended under England. Sudereys, or Suder, when anglicized, became Sodor; and all the Western isles of Scotland being included in one diocese under the Norwegian princes, the bishop appointed to superintend them was called the bishop of Man and the Isles, or the bishop of Sodor and Man. Since Man was conquered by Edward III. it has been separated from the other isles, and its bishops have exercised no jurisdiction over them. Should it now be asked, why then is the bishop of Man still called the bishop of Sodor and Man? we reply, that we have been able to discover no reason; but suppose the appellation to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the same way, as the title king of France has been kept up by the kings of Great Britain, for several centuries after the English were entirely expelled from France.","sp":68,"ep":68},{"h":"SOFA","t":"in the east, a kind of alcove raised half a foot above the floor of a chamber or other apartment; and used as the place of state, where visitors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> are received.

Mr Boulton, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with Mr Fothergill, then his partner, at an expense of \u00a39000, erected a handsome and extensive edifice, with a view of manufacturing metallic toys. The first productions consisted of buttons, buckles, watch-chains, trinkets, and such other articles as were peculiar to Birmingham. Novelty, taste, and variety, were however always conspicuous; and plated wares, known by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEFFIELD\">Sheffield</a> plate, comprising a great variety of useful and ornamental articles, became another permanent subject of manufacture.\n\nTo open channels for the consumption of these commodities, all the northern part of Europe was explored by the mercantile partner Mr Fothergill. A wide and extensive correspondence was thus established, the undertaking became well known, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>, by becoming his own merchant, eventually enjoyed a double profit.\n\nImpelled by an ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the arts, and by the patriotic ambition of forming his favourite Soho into a fruitful seminary of artists, the proprietor extended his views; and men of taste and talents were now sought for, and liberally patronised. A successful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the French or moulded ornaments, consisting of vases, tripods, candelabra, &c., &c., extended the celebrity of the works. Services of plate and other works in silver, both massive and airy, were added, and an assay office was established in Birmingham.\n\nMr Watt, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> improver of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">steam-engine</a>, was afterwards taken into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a> with Mr Boulton; and they carried on at Soho a manufactory of steam-engines, not less beneficial to the public than lucrative to themselves. This valuable machine, the nature and excellencies of which are described in another place (see STEAM-ENGINE), Mr Boulton proposed to apply to the operation of coining, and suitable apparatus was erected at a great expense, for the purpose of being employed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to make a new copper-coining for the kingdom. Artists of merit were engaged, and specimens of exquisite delicacy were exhibited; the works were also employed upon highly finished medals and private coins. To enumerate all the productions of this manufactory would be tedious (A).\n\nIn a national view, Mr Boulton's undertakings are highly valuable and important. By collecting around him artists of various descriptions, rival talents have been called forth, and by successive competition have been multiplied to an extent highly beneficial to the public.

It serves as a support for vegetables, and as a reservoir for receiving and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> their nourishment.\n\nSoils are commonly double or triple compounds of the several reputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> earths, except the barytic. The magnesian likewise sparingly occurs. The more fertile soils afford also a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of coaly substance arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, and some traces of marine acid and gypsum. The vulgar division into clay, chalk, sand, and gravel, is well understood. Loam denotes any soil moderately adhesive; and, according to the ingredient that predominates, it receives the epithets of clayey, chalky, sandy, or gravelly. The intimate mixture of clay with the oxides of iron is called till, and is of a hard consistence and a dark reddish colour. Soils are found by analysis to contain their earthy ingredients in very different proportions. According to M. Giobert, fertile mould in the vicinity of Turin, where the fall of rain amounts yearly to 40 inches, affords for each 100 parts, from 77 to 79 of flex, from 8 to 14 of argill, and from 5 to 12 of calx; besides about one-half of carbonic matter, and nearly an equal weight of gas, partly carbonic and partly hydrocarbonic. The same experimenter represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of barren soils in similar situations to be from 42 to 88 per cent. of flex,\n\n(A) It was at this place, in the year 1772, that Mr Eginton invented an expeditious method of copying pictures in oil; but we do not know how far this method has succeeded.\nlex, from 20 to 30 of argill, and from 4 to 20 of calx. The celebrated Bergman found rich soils in the valleys of Sweden, where the annual quantity of rain is 24 inches, to contain, for each 100 parts, 56 of siliceous sand, 14 of argill, and 30 of calx. In the climate of Paris, where the average fall of rain is 20 inches, fertile mixtures, according to M. Tillet, vary from 46 to 52 per cent. of filex, and from 11 to 17 of argill, with 37 of calx. Hence it appears that in dry countries rich earths are of a closer texture, and contain more of the calcareous ingredient, with less of the siliceous.

Goldsmiths usually make four kinds of folder, viz. folder of eight, where to seven parts of silver there is one of brass or copper; folder of six, where only a sixth part is copper; folder of four, and folder of three. It is the mixture of copper in the folder that makes raised plate come always cheaper than flat.\n\nAs mixtures of gold with a little copper are found to melt with less heat than pure gold itself, these mixtures serve as folders for gold: two pieces of fine gold are soldered by gold that has a small admixture of copper; and gold alloyed with copper is soldered by such as is alloyed with more copper: the workmen add a little silver as well as copper, and vary the proportions of the two to one another, so as to make the colour of the folder correspond as nearly as may be to that of the piece. A mixture of gold and copper is also a folder for fine copper as well as for fine gold. Gold being particularly disposed to unite with iron, proves an excellent folder for the finer kinds of iron and steel instruments.\n\nThe folder used by plumbers is made of two pounds of lead to one of block-tin. Its goodness is tried by melting it, and pouring the bigness of a crown-piece on a table; for, if good, there will arise little bright shining flares therein. The folder for copper is made like that of the plumbers; only with copper and tin; and for very nice works, instead of tin, they sometimes use a quantity of silver. Folder for tin is made of two-thirds of tin and one of lead, or of equal parts of each; but where the work is any thing delicate, as in organ-pipes, where the juncture is scarce discernible, it is made of one part of bismuth and three parts of pewter. The pewterers use a kind of folder made with two parts of tin and one of bismuth; this composition melts with the least heat of any of the folders.\n\nSilver folder is that which is made of two parts of silver and one of brass, and used in soldering those metals. Spelter folder is made of one part of brass and two of spelter or zinc, and is used by the braziers and coppersmiths for soldering brass, copper, and iron. This folder is improved by adding to each ounce of it one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PENNYWEIGHT\">pennyweight</a> of silver; but as it does not melt without a considerable degree of heat, it cannot be used when it\nit is inconvenient to heat the work red-hot; in which case copper and brass are soldered with silver.\n\nThough spelter folder be much cheaper than silver-folder, yet workmen in many cases prefer the latter. And Mr Boyle informs us, that he has found it to run with too moderate a heat, as not much to endanger the melting of the delicate parts of the work to be soldered; and if well made, this silver folder will lie even upon the ordinary kind itself; and so fill up those little cavities that may chance to be left in the first operation, which is not easily done without a folder more easily fusible than the first made use of. As to iron, it is sufficient that it be heated to a white heat, and the two extremities, in this state, hammered together; by which means they became incorporated one with the other.","sp":70,"ep":71},{"h":"SOLDERING","t":"the joining and fastening together of two pieces of the same metal, or of two different metals, by the fusion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of some metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> on the extremities of the metals to be joined.\n\nTo solder upon silver, brass, or iron: Take silver, five pennyweights; brass, four pennyweights; melt them together for soft folder, which runs soonest. Take silver, five pennyweights; copper, three pennyweights; melt them together for hard folder. Beat the folder thin, and lay it on the place to be soldered, which must be first fitted and bound together with wire as occasion requires; then take borax in powder, and temper it like poy, and lay it upon the folder, letting it dry; then cover it with live coals, and blow, and it will run immediately; take it presently out of the fire, and it is done. It is to be observed, that if any thing is to be soldered in two places, which cannot well be done at one time, you must first solder with the harder folder, and then with the soft; for if it be first done with the soft, it will unfolder again before the other is fastened. Let it be observed, that if you would not have your folder run about the piece that is to be soldered, you must rub such places over with chalk.\u2014In the soldering either of gold, silver, copper, or either of the metals above mentioned, there is generally used borax in powder, and sometimes rosin. As to iron, it is sufficient that it be heated red-hot, and the two extremities thus hammered together, by which means they will become incorporated with each other. For the finer kinds of iron and steel instruments, however, gold proves an excellent folder. This metal will dissolve twice or thrice its weight of iron in a degree of heat very far less than that in which iron itself melts; hence if a small plate of gold is wrapped round the parts to be joined, and afterwards melted by a blow-pipe, it strongly unites the pieces together without any injury to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, however delicate.","sp":71,"ep":71},{"h":"SOLDIER","t":"a military man fitted to serve a prince or state in consideration of a certain daily pay.\n\nSOLDIER-Crab.

This design is obtained by the four syllables fa, sol, la, mi.\nThus from fa to sol is a tone, also from sol to la, and from la to mi, without distinguishing the greater or less tone; but from la to fa, also from mi to fa, is only a semitone. If then these be applied in this order, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, &c., they express the natural series from C; and if that be repeated to a second or third octave, we see by them how to express all the different orders of tones and semitones in the diatonic scale; and still above mi will stand, fa, sol, la, and below it the same inverted la, sol, fa, and one mi is always distant from another an octave; which cannot be said of any of the rest, because after mi ascending come always fa, sol, la, which are repeated invertedly descending.\n\nTo conceive the use of this, it is to be remembered, that the first thing in learning to sing, is to make one raise a scale of notes by tones and semitones to an octave, and descend again by the same; and then to rise and fall by greater intervals at a leap, as thirds and fourths, &c., and to do all this by beginning at notes of different pitch. Then those notes are represented by lines and spaces, to which these syllables are applied, and the learners taught to name each line and space thereby, which makes what we call solf\u00e8ge; the use whereof is, that while they are learning to tune the degrees and intervals of sound expressed by notes on a line or space, or learning a song to which no words are applied, they may not only do it the better by means of articulate sounds, but chiefly that by knowing the degrees and intervals expressed by those syllables, they may more readily know the places of the semitones, and the true distance of the notes.

This mountain appears evidently to have been a volcano in ancient times; and the soil is yet so hot, that the workmen employed there in making alum need nothing else besides the heat of the ground for evaporating their liquids. Of this mountain we have the following account by Sir William Hamilton. \"Near Afruni (another mountain, formerly a volcano likewise) rises the Solfaterra, which not only retains its cone and crater, but much of its former heat. In the plain within the crater, smoke issues from many parts, as also from its sides: here, by means of stones and tiles heaped over the crevices, through which the smoke passes, they collect in an awkward manner what they call sale armonico; and from the land of the plain they extract sulphur and alum. This spot, well attended to, might certainly produce a good revenue, whereas I doubt if they have hitherto ever cleared 200l. a-year by it. The hollow found produced by throwing a heavy stone on the plain of the crater of the Solfaterra, seems to indicate that it is supported by a sort of arched natural vault; and one is induced to think that there is a pool of water beneath this vault (which boils by the heat of a subterranean fire still deeper), by the very moist steam that issues from the cracks in the plain of the Solfaterra, which, like that of boiling water, runs off a sword or knife, presented to it, in great drops. On the outside, and at the foot of the cone of the Solfaterra, towards the lake of Agnano, water rushes out of the rocks so hot as to raise the quicksilver in Fahrenheit's thermometer to the degree of boiling water (A); a fact of which I was myself an eye-witness. This place, well worthy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the curious, has been taken little notice of; it is called the Pisciarelli. The common people of Naples have great faith in the efficacy of this water; and make much of it in all cutaneous disorders, as well as for another disorder that prevails here. It seems to be impregnated chiefly with sulphur and alum. When you approach your ear to the rocks of the Pisciarelli, from whence this water issues, you hear a horrid boiling noise, which seems to proceed from the huge cauldron that may be supposed to be under the plain of the Solfaterra. On the other side of the Solfaterra, next the sea, there is a rock which has communicated with the sea, till part of it was cut away to make the road to Puzzole; this was undoubtedly a considerable lava, that ran from the Solfaterra when it was an active volcano. Under this rock of lava, which is more than 70 feet high, there is a stratum of pumice and ashes. This ancient lava is about a quarter of a mile broad; you meet with it abruptly before you come in sight of Puzzole, and it finishes as abruptly within about 100 paces of the town. The ancient name of the Solfaterra was Forum Vulcani; a strong proof of its origin from subterraneous fire. The degree of heat that the Solfaterra has preserved for so many ages, seems to have calcined the stones upon its cone and in its crater, as they are very white and crumble easily in the hottest parts.","sp":72,"ep":72},{"h":"SOLICITOR","t":"a person employed to take care of and manage suits depending in the courts of law or equity.

He began his reign by restoring those persons their possessions whom his father had unjustly plundered. He re-established the authority of the tribunals, which was almost annihilated, and bestowed the government of provinces upon none but persons of wealth and probity: \"I would have my viceroys (he used to say) resemble those rivers that fertilize the fields through which they pass, not those torrents which sweep everything before them.\"\n\nAfter concluding a truce with Ismael Sophy of Persia, and subduing Gozeli Bey, who had raised a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> in Syria, he turned his arms against Europe.

In 1526 he defeated and slew the king of Hungary in the famous battle of Mohatz. Three years after he conquered Buda, and immediately laid siege to Vienna itself. But after continuing 20 days before that city, and assaulting it 20 times, he was obliged to retreat with the loss of 80,000 men. Some time after he was defeated by the Persians, and disappointed in his hopes of taking Malta. He succeeded, however, in dispossessing the Genoese of Chio, an island which had belonged to that republic for more than 200 years.\n\nHe died at the age of 76, while he was besieging Szigeth, a town in Hungary, on the 30th August 1566.\n\nHe was a prince of the strictest probity, a lover of justice, and vigorous in the execution of it; but he tarnished all his glory by the cruelty of his disposition.

Almost all the hot countries produce this venomous little creature. It lies under the sand to seize other insects as they go by; and if it meet with any uncovered part of a man, produces a wound which proves very painful; it is said that the bite is absolutely mortal, but probably this is not true.

His father leaving little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a>, he had recourse to merchandise for his subsistence. He had, however, a greater thirst after knowledge and fame than after riches, and made his mercantile voyages subservient to the increase of his intellectual treasures. He very early cultivated the art of poetry, and applied himself to the study of moral and civil wisdom. When the Athenians, tired out with a long and troublesome war with the Megarensians, for the recovery of the island of Salamis, prohibited any one, under pain of death, to propose the renewal of their claim to that island, Solon thinking the prohibition dishonourable to the state, and finding many of the younger citizens desirous to revive the war, feigned himself mad, and took care to have the report of his insanity spread through the city. In the mean time he composed an elegy adapted to the state of public affairs, which he committed to memory. Every thing being thus prepared, he fell into the market-place with the kind of cap on his head which was commonly worn by sick persons, and, ascending the herald's stand, he delivered, to a numerous crowd, his lamentation for the desertion of Salamis. The verses were heard with general applause; and Pittacus seconded his advice, and urged the people to renew the war. The decree was immediately repealed; the claim to Salamis was resumed; and the conduct of the war was committed to Solon and Pittacus, who, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>, defeated the Megarensians, and recovered Salamis.\n\nHis popularity was extended through Greece in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a successful alliance which he formed among the states in defence of the temple at Delphi against the Corinthians. When dissensions had arisen at Athens between the rich creditors and their poor debtors, Solon was created archon, with the united powers of supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>. He soon restored harmony between the rich and poor: He cancelled the debts which had proved the occasion of so much oppression; and ordained that in future no creditor should be allowed to seize the body of the debtor for his security: He made a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the people, instituted new courts of judicature, and framed a judicious code of laws, which afterwards became the basis of the laws of the twelve tables in Rome. Among his criminal laws are many wise and excellent regulations; but the code is necessarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> with respect to those principles which must be derived from the knowledge of the true God, and of pure morality, as the certain foundations of national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. Two of them in particular were very exceptionable; the permission of a voluntary exile to persons that had been guilty of premeditated murder, and the appointment of a less severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> for a rape than for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a>.

And all this purely according to the fancy of the composer; who, without confining himself to any general rules of counterpoint, or to any fixed number or measure, gives a loose to his genius, and runs from one mode, measure, &c. to another, as he thinks fit. This species of composition had its rise about the middle of the 17th century; those who have most excelled in it were Baffani and Corelli. We have sonatas of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and even 8 parts, but usually they are performed by a single violin, or with two violins, and a thorough bass for the harpsichord; and frequently a more figured bass for the bass viol, &c.\n\nThere are a thousand different species of sonatas; but the Italians usually reduce them to two kinds. Sonate de chiefa, that is, sonatas proper for church music, which usually begin with a grave solemn motion, suitable to the dignity and sanctity of the place and the service, after which they strike into a brisker, gayer, and richer manner. These are what they more peculiarly call sonatas. Sonate de camera, or sonatas for the chamber, are properly serenades of several little pieces, for dancing, only composed to the same tune. They usually begin with a prelude or little sonata, serving as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to all the rest; afterwards come the allemande, pavane, courant, and other serious dances; then jigs, gavots, minuets, chacons, pr\u00e9l\u00e8caillles, and other gay airs: the whole composed in the same tune or mode.","sp":76,"ep":76},{"h":"SONCHUS","t":"Sow-thistle, in Botany, a genus of plants belonging to the class of Syngenesia, and to the order of Polygamin\u00e6 aquatilis; and in the natural system ranged under the 49th order, Composit\u00e6.

See Air.\n\nSONG of Birds, is defined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Duines Barrington to be a succession of three or more different notes, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> without interruption, during the same interval, with a musical bar of four crotchets in an adagio movement, or whilst a pendulum swings four seconds.\n\nIt is affirmed, that the notes of birds are no more innate than language in man, and that they depend upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, as far as their organs will enable them to imitate the sounds which they have frequent opportunities of hearing: and their adhering so steadily, even in a wild state, to the same song, is owing to the nestlings attending only to the instruction of the parent bird, whilst they disregard the notes of all others that may perhaps be singing round them.\n\nBirds in a wild state do not commonly sing above 10 weeks in the year, whereas birds that have plenty of food in a cage sing the greatest part of the year; and we may add, that the female of no species of birds ever sings. This is a wise provision of nature, because her song would discover her nest. In the same manner, we may rationally account for her inferiority in plumage. The faculty of singing is confined to the cock birds; and accordingly Mr Hunter, in dissecting birds of several species, found the muscles of the larynx to be stronger\nSON\n\nStronger in the nightingale than in any other bird of the same size; and in all those instances, where he defeated both cock and hen, the same muscles were stronger in the cock. To the same purpose, it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> as ancient as the time of Pliny, that a capon does not crow.\n\nSome have ascribed the singing of the cock-bird in the spring solely to the motive of pleasing his mate during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUBATION\">incubation</a>; others, who allow that it is partly for this end, believe it is partly owing also to another cause, viz., the great abundance of plants and insects in the spring, which, as well as seeds, are the proper food of singing birds at that time of the year.\n\nMr Barrington remarks, that there is no instance of any singing bird which exceeds our blackbird in size; and this, he supposes, may arise from the difficulty of its concealing itself, if it called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of its enemies, not only by its bulk, but by the proportionable loudness of its notes. This writer farther observes, that some passages of the song in a few kinds of birds correspond with the intervals of our musical scale, of which the cuckoo is a striking, and known instance; but the greater part of their long cannot be reduced to a musical scale; partly, because the rapidity is often so great, and it is also so uncertain when they may stop, that we cannot reduce the passages to form a musical bar in any time whatsoever; partly also, because the pitch of most birds is considerably higher than the most shrill notes of those instruments which have the greatest compass; and principally, because the intervals used by birds are commonly so minute, that we cannot judge of them from the more gross intervals into which we divide our musical octave. This writer apprehends, that all birds sing in the same key; and in order to discover this key, he informs us, that the following notes have been observed in different birds, A, B flat, C, D, F, and G; and therefore E only is wanting to complete the scale; now these intervals, he says, can only be found in the key of F with a sharp third, or that of G with a flat third; and he supposes it to be the latter, because admitting that the first musical notes were learned from birds, those of the cuckoo, which have been most attended to, form a flat third, and most of our compositions are in a flat third, where music is simple, and consists merely of melody. As a farther evidence that birds sing always in the same key, it has been found by attending to a nightingale, as well as a robin which was educated under him, that the notes reducible to our intervals of the octave were always precisely the same.\n\nMost people, who have not attended to the notes of birds, suppose, that every species sing exactly the same notes and passages: but this is by no means true; though it is admitted that there is a general resemblance. Thus the London bird-catchers prefer the song of the Kentish goldfinches, and Essex chaffinches; and some of the nightingale fanciers prefer a Surry bird to those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a>.\n\nOf all singing birds, the song of the nightingale has been most universally admired: and its superiority (deduced from a caged bird) consists in the following particulars; its tone is much more mellow than that of any other bird, though at the same time, by a proper exertion of its musical powers, it can be very brilliant. Another point of superiority is its continuance of long without a pause, which is sometimes no less than 20 seconds; and when respiration becomes necessary, it takes it with as much judgment as an opera-finger. The sky-lark in this particular, as well as in compass and variety, is only second to the nightingale. The nightingale also sings (if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> may be allowed) with superior judgment and taste. Mr Barrington has observed, that his nightingale, which was a very capital bird, began softly like the ancient orators, referring its breath to swell certain notes, which by these means had a most astonishing effect. This writer adds, that the notes of birds, which are annually imported from Asia, Africa, and America, both singly and in concert, are not to be compared to those of European birds.\n\nThe following table, formed by Mr Barrington, agreeably to the idea of M. de Piles in estimating the merits of painters, is designed to exhibit the comparative merit of the British singing birds; in which 20 is supposed to be the point of absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\n| Philosopha- | Mellowness | Sprightly- | Flaming- | Compass & | Execution |\n|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Nightingale | 19         | 14        | 19       | 19        | 19        |\n| Sky-lark    | 4          | 19        | 4        | 18        | 18        |\n| Wood-lark   | 18         | 4         | 17       | 12        | 8         |\n| Tit-lark    | 12         | 12        | 12       | 12        | 12        |\n| Linnet      | 12         | 16        | 12       | 16        | 18        |\n| Goldfinch   | 4          | 19        | 4        | 12        | 12        |\n| Chaffinch   | 4          | 12        | 4        | 8         | 8         |\n| Greenfinch  | 4          | 4         | 4        | 4         | 6         |\n| Hedge-sparrow| 6         | 0         | 6        | 4         | 4         |\n| Aberdavine or siskin | 2 | 4         | 0        | 4         | 4         |\n| Red-poll    | 0          | 4         | 0        | 4         | 4         |\n| Thrush      | 4          | 4         | 4        | 4         | 4         |\n| Blackbird   | 4          | 0         | 2        | 2         | 2         |\n| Robin       | 6          | 16        | 12       | 12        | 14        |\n| Wren        | 0          | 12        | 0        | 4         | 2         |\n| Reed sparrow| 0          | 4         | 0        | 2         | 2         |\n| Black cap, or Norfolk mock nightingale | 14 | 12 | 12 | 14 | 14 |","sp":76,"ep":77},{"h":"SONNA","t":"a book of Mahometan traditions, which the orthodox muslims are required to believe.","sp":77,"ep":77},{"h":"SONNER","t":"WILLIAM, an eminent English antiquary, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a> in 1626.

But Bochart affirms us, that sophi in the original Persian language, signifies one that is pure in his religion, and who prefers the service of God in all things; and derives it from an order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> called by the same name. The sophis value themselves on their illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>.

The more eminent of those sophis are complimented with the title Schiek, that is, reverend, much as in Roman countries the religious are called reverend fathers. Schiek Sophi, who laid the foundation of the grandeur of the royal house of Persia, was the founder, or rather the restorer of this order: Ishmael, who conquered Persia, was himself a sophi, and greatly valued himself on his being so. He chose all the guards of his person from among the religious of this order; and would have all the great lords of his court sophis. The king of Persia is still grandmaster of the order; and the lords continue to enter into it, though it be now fallen under some contempt.","sp":78,"ep":78},{"h":"SOPHISM","t":"in Logic, a specious argument having the appearance of truth, but leading to falsehood. Sophisms are reduced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> into eight classes, an arrangement so just and comprehensive, that it is equally proper in present as in former times. 1. Ignoratio elenchi, in which the sophist seems to determine the question, while he does it only in appearance. Thus the question, \"Whether the excess of wine be hurtful?\" seems to be determined by proving, that wine revives the spirits and gives a man courage: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> point is here kept out of sight; for still it may be hurtful to health, to fortune, and reputation. 2. Petitio principii, a begging of the question, or taking for granted that which remains to be proved, as if any one should undertake to prove that the soul is extended through all the parts of the body, because it resides in every member. This is affirming the same thing in different words. 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">Reasoning</a> in a circle; as when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a> prove the Scriptures to be the word of God by the authority of the church, and the authority of the church from the Scriptures. 4. Non causa pro causa, or the afflicting of a false cause to any effect. Thus the supposed principle, that nature abhors a vacuum, was applied to explain the rising of water in a pump before Galileo discovered that it was owing to the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. In this way the vulgar ascribe accidents to divine vengeance, and the heresies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> of modern times are said to be owing to learning. 5. Fallacia accidentis, in which the sophist represents what is merely accidental as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to the nature of the subject. This is nearly allied to the former, and is committed by the Mahometans and Roman Catholics. The Mahometans forbid wine, because it is sometimes the occasion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a> and quarrels; and the Roman Catholics prohibit the reading of the Bible, because it has sometimes promoted heresies. 6. By deducing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> assertion from what is true only in particular circumstances, and the reverse: thus some men argue, \"transcribers have committed many errors in copying the Scriptures, therefore they are not to be depended on.\" 7. By asserting anything in a compound sense which is only true in a divided sense; so when the Scriptures assure us, that the worst of sinners may be saved, it does not mean that they shall be saved while they remain sinners, but that if they repent they may be saved. 8. By an abuse of the ambiguity of words. Thus Mr Hume reasons in his Essay on Miracles: \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a> is our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; now we know from experience, that the laws of nature are fixed and invariable. On the other hand, testimony is variable and often false; therefore since our evidence for the reality of miracles rests solely on testimony which is variable, and our evidence for the uniformity of the laws of nature is invariable, miracles are not to be believed.\" The sophistry of this reasoning depends on the ambiguity of the word experience, which in the first proposition signifies the maxims which we form from our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> and reflection; in the second it is confounded with testimony; for it is by the testimony of others, as well as our own observation, that we learn whether the laws of nature are variable or invariable. The Essay on Miracles may be recommended to those who wish to see more examples of sophistry; as we believe most of the eight species of sophisms which we have mentioned are well illustrated by examples in that essay.","sp":78,"ep":78},{"h":"SOPHIST","t":"an appellation assumed in the early periods of Grecian history by those who devoted their time to the study of science.

Superior vigour and address in the exercises of the palestra, and skill in music, were the great accomplishments of young men in the states of Greece. In these, Sophocles excelled; nor was he less distinguished by the beauty of his person. He was also instructed in the noblest of all sciences, civil polity and religion: from the first of these he derived an unshaken love of his country, which he served in some embassies, and in high military command with Pericles; from the latter he was impressed with a pious reverence for the gods, manifested by the inviolable integrity of his life. But his studies were early devoted to the tragic muse; the spirit of Eschylus lent a fire to his genius, and excited that noble emulation which led him to contend with, and sometimes to bear away the prize from, his great master. He wrote 43 tragedies, of which 7 only have escaped the ravages of time: and having testified his love of his country by refusing to leave it, though invited by many kings; and having enjoyed the uninterrupted esteem and affection of his fellow citizens, which neither the gallant actions and sublime genius of Eschylus, nor the tender spirit and philosophic virtue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a>, could secure to them, he died in the 91st year of his age, about 406 years before Christ. The burial-place of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> was at Decelia, which the Lacedemonians had at that time seized and fortified; but Lycaon, the Spartan chief, permitted the Athenians to inter their deceased poet; and they paid him all the honours due to his love of his country, integrity of life, and high poetic excellence. Eschylus had at once feigned the highest post of honour in the field of poetry, the true sublime; to that eminence his claim could not be disputed. Sophocles had a noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of mind, but tempered with so fine a taste, and so chastened a judgement, that he never passed the bounds of propriety. Under his conduct the tragic muse appeared with the chaste dignity of some noble matron at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> solemnity; harmony is in her voice, and grace in all her motions. From him the theatre received some additional embellishments; and Sophocles the drama the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of a third speaker, which made it more active and interesting: but his distinguished excellence is in the judicious disposition of the fable, and so nice a connection and dependence of the parts on each other, that they all agree to make the event not only probable, but even necessary. This is peculiarly admirable in his \"Oedipus King of Thebes;\" and in this important point he is far superior to every other dramatic writer.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a> of the children of Sophocles is well known.

There is a variety with yellow striped leaves. This species grows wild in many parts of this island in mountainous places, woods, and hedge-rows, often growing to the size of timber; and is admitted into most ornamental plantations, for the beauty of its growth, foliage, flowers, and fruit; the latter, in particular, being produced in numerous red large bunches all over the tree, exhibit a fine appearance in autumn and winter, till devoured by the birds, especially the blackbird and thrush, which are so allured by this fruit as to flock from all parts and feed on it voraciously.\u2014In the island of Jura the juice of the berries is employed as an acid for punch. It is probable that this tree was in high esteem with the Druids; for it is more abundant than any other tree in the neighborhood of those Druidical circles of stones, so common in North Britain. It is still believed by some persons, that a branch of this tree can defend them from enchantment or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>. Even the cattle are supposed to be preserved by it from danger. The dairy-maid drives them to the summer pastures with a rod of the rowan-tree, and drives them home again with the same.

Sorcery is therefore to be distinguished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>; an art which was supposed to be practised, not by commanding evil spirits, but by compact with the devil. As an instance of the power of bad smells over demons or evil spirits, we may mention the flight of the evil spirit mentioned in Tobit into the remote parts of Egypt, produced, it is said, by the smell of the burnt liver of a fish. Lilly informs us, that one Evans having raised a spirit at the request of Lord Bothwell and Sir Kenelm Digby, and forgetting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a>, the spirit, vexed at the disappointment, pulled him without the circle, and carried him from his house in the Minories into a field near Battersea Causeway.\n\nKing James, in his Daemonologia, has given a very full account of the art of sorcery. \"Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> things (says he) cannot well in that errand be wanted: holy water (whereby the devil mocks the papists), and some present of a living thing unto him. There are likewise certain cases and hours that they observe in this purpose. These things being all ready and prepared, circles are made, triangular, quadrangular, round, double, or single, according to the form of the apparition they crave. When the conjured spirit appears, which will not be while after many circumstances, long prayers, and much muttering and murmurings of the conjurors, like a papist priest dispatching a hunting maske\u2014how soon, I say, he appears, if they have missed one jot of all their rites; or if any of their feet once fly over the circle, through terror of his fearfull apparition, he pales himself at that time, in his owne hand, of that due debt which they ought him; and otherwise would have delayed longer to have paid him: I mean, he carries them with him, body and soule.\" How the conjurors made triangular or quadrangular circles, his majesty has not informed us, nor does he seem to imagine there was any difficulty in the matter. We are therefore led to suppose, that he learned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> from the same system as Dr Sacheverell, who, in one of his speeches or sermons, made use of the following simile: \"They concur like parallel lines, meeting in one common centre.\"\n\nAnother mode of consulting spirits was by the beryl, by means of a spectator or seer; who, to have a complete sight, ought to be a pure virgin, a youth who had not known woman, or at least a person of irreproachable life and purity of manners. The method of such consultation is this: The conjuror having repeated the necessary charms and adjurations, with the litany or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVOCATION\">invocation</a> peculiar to the spirits or angels he wishes to call (for every one has his particular form), the seer looks into a crystal or beryl, wherein he will see the answer, represented either by types or figures; and sometimes, though very rarely, will hear the angels or spirits speak articulately. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> is, as Lilly says, like the Irish, much in the throat. Lilly describes one of these beryls or crystals. It was, he says, as large as an orange, set in silver, with a cross at the top, and round about engraved the names of the angels Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel.

And if any person should attempt by forcery to discover hidden treasure,\nSORCERY or to restore stolen goods, or to provoke unlawful love, or to hurt any man or beast, though the same were not effected, he or she should suffer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a> and pillory for the first offence, and death for the second.

The natives of Lapland boil large quantities of the leaves in water, and mix the juice when cold with the milk of their rein-deer, which they esteem an agreeable and wholesome food. The Dutch are said to cultivate this plant for its usefulness in the dyeing of woollen cloths black; and we know that by means of the common broad-leaved sorrel an excellent black colour is, in many places of Scotland, given to woollen stuffs without the aid of copperas. As this mode of dyeing does not in the smallest degree injure the texture of the cloth, which continues to the last soft and silky, without that hardness to the touch which it acquires when dyed black by means of copperas, our readers will probably thank us for the following receipt, with which we have been favoured by a learned physician:\n\nLet the stuff to be dyed be well washed with soap and water, and afterwards completely dried. Then of the common broad-leaved sorrel boil as much as shall make an acid decoction of sufficient quantity to let the stuff to be dyed lie in it open and easy to be stirred. The greater quantity of sorrel that is used, the better will the colour be; and therefore if the pot or cauldron will not hold enough at once, when part has been sufficiently boiled, it must be taken out and wrung, and a fresh quantity be boiled in the same juice or decoction. When the liquor is made sufficiently acid, strain it from the sorrel through a sieve, put the cloth or yarn into it, and let it boil for two hours, stirring it frequently. If stockings be among the stuff to be dyed, it will be expedient, after they have been an hour in the boiling liquor, to turn them inside out, and at the end of the second hour let the whole be poured into a tub or any other vessel. The pot or cauldron must then be washed, and water put into it, with half a pound of logwood chips for every pound of dry yarn or cloth. The logwood and water should boil slowly for four hours; and then the cloth or yarn being wrung from the four liquor, and put into the logwood decoction, the whole must be suffered to boil slowly for four hours, stockings, if there be any, being turned inside out at the end of two hours. Of this last decoction there must, as of the former, be enough to let the cloth lie open and easy to be stirred while boiling. At the end of the four hours the cloth must be taken out, and among the boiling liquor, first removed from the fire, must be poured a Scotch pint or half an English gallon of stale urine for every pound of dry cloth or other stuff to be dyed. When this compound liquor has been stirred and become cold, the cloth must be put into it and suffered to remain well covered for 12 hours, and then dried in the shade; after which, to divest it of smell or any other impurity, it may be washed in cold water, and dried for use.\n\nWood-SORREL.

To this method of divination succeeded that which has been called the fates Homeriaca and fates Virgiliaca, a mode of inquiring into futurity, which undoubtedly took its rise from a general custom of the oracular priests of delivering their answers in verse; it subsisted a long time among the Greeks and Romans; and being from them adopted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, it was not till after a long succession of centuries that it became exploded. Among the Romans it consisted in opening some celebrated poet at random, and among the Christians the Scriptures, and drawing, from the first passage which presented itself to the eye, a prognostic of what would befall one's self or others, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> for conduct when under any exigency. There is good evidence that this was none of the vulgar errors; the greatest persons, philosophers of the best repute, admitted this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>. Socrates, when in prison, hearing this line of Homer,\n\nWithin three days I Phthia's shore shall see,\nimmediately said, within three days I shall be out of the world;\nworld; gathering it from the double meaning of the word Phthia, which in Greek is both the name of a country and signifies corruption or death. This prediction, addressed to \u00c6lchines, was not easily forgotten, as it was verified.\n\nWhen this superstition passed from Paganism into Christianity, the Christians had two methods of consulting the divine will from the Scriptures; the one, casually, to open the divine writings, and take their direction, as above mentioned; the other, to go to church with a purpose of receiving, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the will of heaven, the words of the Scripture, which were singing at the instant of one's entrance.\n\nThis unwarrantable practice of inquiring into futurity prevailed very generally in England till the beginning of the 18th century; and sometimes the books of Scripture, and sometimes the poems of Virgil, were consulted for oracular responses. One remarkable instance is that of King Charles I, who being at Oxford during the civil wars, went one day to see the public library, where he was shown, among other books, a Virgil nobly printed and exquisitely bound. The lord Falkland, to divert the king, would have his majesty make a trial of his fortune by the Sortes Virgilianae. Whereupon the king opening the book, the passage which happened to come up was this:\n\n*At, bello audacis populi vexatus et armis,\nFinibus extorris, complexu avulsius Iuli,\nAuxilium implorat; videtque indigna fiorum\nFunera: nec, cum se sub liges patres inique\nTradiderat, regno aut optata luce fruatur;\nSed cadat ante diem, mediaque inhumerato arena.*\nEneid, lib. iv.\n\nYet let a race, untamed and haughty foes,\nHis peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose;\nOppressed with numbers in the unequal field,\nHis men discouraged, and himself expelled,\nLet him for succour sue from place to place,\nTorn from his subjects, and his son's embrace:\nFirst let him see his friends in battle slain,\nAnd their untimely fate lament in vain;\nAnd when at length the cruel war shall cease,\nOn hard conditions may he buy his peace.\nNor let him then enjoy supreme command,\nBut fall untimely by some hostile hand,\nAnd lie unburied on the barren land.\n\nLord Falkland observing that the king was concerned at this accident, would likewise try his own fortune in the same manner, hoping he might fall upon some passage that would have no relation to his case, and thereby divert the king's thoughts from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> which the other might have upon him; but the place he stumbled upon was as much suited to his destiny as the other had been to the king's; being the lamentation of Evander for the untimely death of his son Palas*: for this lord's eldest son, a young man of an amiable character, had been slain in the first battle of Newbury.\n\nWe have ourselves known several whose devotion has not always been regulated by judgement pursue this method of divination; and have generally observed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> has been despair or presumption.

The former is used in shallow waters, and the latter at a great distance from the shore; particularly on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the land after a sea-voyage. Accordingly the lines employed for this purpose are called the deep-sea lead-line, and the hand lead-line.\n\nThe hand lead-line, which is usually 20 fathoms in length, is marked at every two or three fathoms; so that the depth of the water may be ascertained either in the day or night. At the depth of two and three fathoms, there are marks of black leather; at 5 fathoms, there is a white rag; at 7, a red rag; at 10, black leather; at 13, black leather; at 15, a white rag; and at 17, a red ditto.\n\nSounding with the hand lead, which is called heaving the lead by leamen, is generally performed by a man who stands in the main-chains to windward. Having the line quite ready to run out without interruption, he holds it nearly at the distance of a fathom from the plummet; and having swung the latter backwards and forwards three or four times, in order to acquire the greater velocity, he swings it round his head, and thence as far forward as is necessary; so that, by the lead's sinking whilst the ship advances, the line may be almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> when it reaches the bottom. The person sounding then proclaims the depth of the water in a kind of song resembling the cries of hawkers in a city. Thus if the mark of five fathoms is close to the surface of the water, he calls, 'By the mark five!' and as there is no mark at four, six, eight, &c., he estimates those numbers, and calls, 'By the dip four,' &c. If he judges it to be a quarter or an half more than any particular number, he calls, 'And a quarter five! and a half four,' &c. If he conceives the depth to be three quarters more than a particular number, he calls it a quarter less than the next; thus, at four fathoms and three fourths he calls 'A quarter less five!' and so on.\n\nThe deep sea lead is marked with two knots at 20 fathoms, three at 30, four at 40, and so on to the end. It is also marked with a single knot in the middle of each interval, as at 25, 35, 45 fathoms, &c. To use this lead more effectually at sea, or in deep water on the sea coast, it is usual previously to bring to the ship, in order to retard her course: the lead is then thrown as far as possible from the ship on the line of her drift, so that, as it sinks, the ship drives more perpendicularly over it. The pilot, feeling the lead strike the bottom, readily discovers the depth of the water by the mark on the line nearest its surface. The bottom of the lead being also well rubbed over with tallow, retains the distinguishing marks of the bottom, as shells, ooze, gravel, &c., which naturally adhere to it.\n\nThe depth of the water, and the nature of the ground, which is called the soundings, are carefully marked in the log-book, as well to determine the distance of the place from the shore, as to correct the observations of former pilots.\n\nA machine for the same purpose has been invented by Mr Massey, of which the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is given:\n\n\"The importance of obtaining true soundings at sea must\nSounding be admitted by every seaman; and it is rather singular, that no other method than the common lead has hitherto been brought into use; as its imperfections are very generally acknowledged.\n\n\"Many vessels have been lost, by depending upon the soundings taken in the usual way. The difficulty of obtaining the true perpendicular, and the uncertainty as to the exact moment when the lead strikes the bottom, upon which the accuracy of the result depends, must always prevent the possibility of obtaining the true depth, while the ship has any considerable way upon her. Indeed, it has been acknowledged by experienced seamen, during some experiments, made at various times, in the river Mersey, that they could not depend upon the common lead, when going five or six knots in the hour, in ten or twelve fathoms of water. When the depth is considerable, the vessel must be hove to, which is an operation attended with great loss of time, and sometimes considerable injury to the sails; and during a chase, this inconvenience must be particularly felt.\n\n\"True soundings may be taken with this machine in thirty fathoms water, without the trouble of heaving the vessel to, although she may be going at the rate of six miles in the hour. True soundings may also thus be obtained in very deep water, where it is not possible to take them by the common lead.\n\n\"Fig. 1. represents the sounding machine. \\(a\\) is the founding weight, containing a register, \\(i\\), \\(2\\), with two dials: the hand of the dial \\(i\\) makes one revolution when the weight has descended twenty fathoms, the other revolves once when the descent amounts to five hundred fathoms. A rotator, \\(b\\), similar to that attached to the log, communicates with the wheel work of the dials \\(i\\), \\(2\\), by means of the rod \\(c\\), on which there are three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> joints, \\(3\\), \\(4\\), and \\(5\\). This rod is supported during the descent of the weight, by the drop, \\(d\\), at the end of which is a fork, \\(6\\), and a friction wheel, \\(7\\).\n\n\"When the machine is to be used, a founding line is fastened to the ring, \\(e\\); and one of the vanes of the rotator is slipped into the spring \\(8\\); the rotator will then be in the position indicated by the dotted lines, \\(x\\). The indices must be set at \\(o\\), and the cover or lid, \\(f\\), be shut. The machine must then be projected perpendicularly into the sea. As soon as it reaches the surface, the resistance of the water forces the dotted rotator, \\(x\\), out of the spring \\(8\\), and it assumes its perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> as represented by the rotator \\(b\\). As the machine descends, it is evident the rotator will revolve, and its motion be communicated freely past the friction wheel \\(7\\), and the universal joint \\(5\\), to the wheel work of the dials \\(i\\), \\(2\\), and thus indicate the space passed through in fathoms. When the machine has arrived at the bottom, the rotator, as it is no longer buoyed up by the reaction of the water, will fall to the bottom, quitting the fork of the drop \\(d\\), which will also fall from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position, and in its descent, by means of the locking rod \\(9\\), prevent the rotator from revolving as the machine is drawn up. When at the bottom, the rotator will be in the position of the dotted lines \\(y\\).\n\n\"This machine, simple in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, and scarcely more liable to accident than the common lead, ascertains, with the utmost precision, the perpendicular depth, by the mere act of descent through the water. No mistake can arise from that common source of error, the drift or lee-way of the ship during the time of descent; nor does an operation of such importance depend upon Sounding, the uncertain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> caused by the lead striking the bottom, on which the accuracy of the common log altogether depends, and which, it is well known, frequently and materially misleads the best seaman: for though a thousand fathoms of line were paid out, in the smallest depth of water, no inaccuracy could arise, as the perpendicular depth, at the point of heaving, would be registered on the index. The only inconvenience experienced would be the additional labour necessary for hauling in the excess of line. The most inexperienced person may use this machine, without risk of error, in the most turbulent sea, and during the night.\n\n\"The advantages already enumerated would render the founding machine of great importance; but there are other properties of still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>.\n\n\"To heave a ship to, in order to obtain soundings, on a lee shore, in stormy weather, is a very disagreeable operation, attended with much trouble, and loss of way; also with considerable danger to the ship's sails; indeed, it would often, under such circumstances, be attended with great hazard to the safety of the ship. To avoid these unpleasant consequences, the master sometimes adopts a measure, which he conceives to be the least exceptionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a>, by running on without founding at all.\n\n\"To prove how much inconvenience and danger are avoided by Maffey's lead, it is enough to state, that soundings may be taken in depth from 60 to 80 fathoms, while the ship is under way, at the rate of three miles an hour; and as the rate of falling may be still materially reduced, without entirely stopping the vessel, or altering her course, so may soundings be had, to any depth required, while she is under way.\n\n\"In order more clearly to show the superiority of this machine, and make it apparent, that the quantity of stray-line veered out does not at all affect the truth of the result: suppose the common lead thrown from the mizen chains of the ship, which may be represented by the point \\(a\\) of the triangle \\(abc\\) (fig. 2.), and that the ship Fig. 2. has moved forwards through the space equal to the line \\(bc\\), while the lead has descended through the line \\(ac\\); it is evident, that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, in this case, to ascertain the exact depth, as a quantity of line, equal to \\(ab\\), would be paid out, whereas the true depth is equal only to the line \\(ac\\), which is much less. But the case is very different when the patent founding machine is used, as the operation ceases when it has reached the bottom; nor is the stray-line, \\(ab\\), whatever its length, at all taken into the account.\n\n\"It has been extremely difficult, and sometimes impossible, to obtain soundings in very deep water with the common lead, which may perhaps be thus accounted for. The common line which is used for founding, though, if left to itself, it would sink in water, yet its descent would be much slower than that of the lead, separately; it consequently follows, that the lead must be so much impeded by carrying the line with it, that when it does reach the bottom, there will be scarcely any sensible check to enable the seaman to know the precise moment. Indeed, if he can ascertain even this to a certainty, he still cannot depend upon the truth of his soundings; for if there be the least drift or current, the line itself will assume a curve, similar to that of the line of a kite in the air. These two causes will always operate...\"\nAfter so fully describing the principle of the patent founding machine, it is scarcely necessary to prove, that it is liable to neither of the foregoing objections; and it may be sufficient to say, that, as it will certainly find its way to the bottom, if a sufficient portion of iron-line be allowed to guard against its being checked in its progress, and the certainty of its having reached the bottom may be ascertained by the arming, there can be no doubt of the practicability of its obtaining foundings, in any depth, and no reasonable doubt of their correctness when obtained.\n\nFrom the construction of this machine, it might be imagined, that the rotator would impede its motion through the water, and that it could not descend so rapidly as the common lead; but during repeated trials, in thirteen fathoms water, in which the rotator was frequently detached, and the lead suffered to descend alone, there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> perceptible in the time of their descent, though an excellent quarter second stop watch was used during the experiment, to detect any change. The following table shows how very uniformly the times of descent corresponded with the depths in fathoms, during a series of trials made on the river Mersey, with the patent lead, weighing 14 pounds.\n\nThe manner of conducting these experiments was such as is deserving of perfect reliance. Two pilots, of well-known ability and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, were employed: one threw the lead, and the other, the moment he found, by the slackening of the rope, that the weight had arrived at the bottom, cried 'stop,' to a third person who held the watch.\n\n| Time of descent | Fathoms |\n|----------------|---------|\n| 2 seconds      | 2 1/2   |\n| 2 1/2          | 3       |\n| 3              | 4       |\n| 5              | 8       |\n| 5 1/2          | 8 1/2   |\n| 6              | 10      |\n| 6              | 10      |\n| 7              | 11 1/2  |\n\nTaken when under sail, at upwards of five knots in the hour.\n\nSeveral captains and masters in the navy have made trial of the log and founding machine, and given very favourable reports of their performance; and it has been adopted by order of the Navy Board in the British navy.*","sp":83,"ep":85},{"h":"SOUP","t":"a strong decoction of flesh or other substances.\n\nPortable or dry soup is a kind of cake formed by boiling the gelatinous parts of animal substances till the watery parts are evaporated.

These are to be boiled in a sufficient quantity of water, and the scum taken off as usual; after which the soup is to be separated from the meat by straining and pressure. The meat is then to be boiled a second time in other water; and the two decoctions, being added together, must be left to cool, in order that the fat may be exactly separated. The soup must then be clarified with five or six whites of eggs, and a sufficient quantity of common salt added. The liquor is then strained through flannel, and evaporated on the water-bath to the consistence of a very thick paste; after which it is spread rather thin upon a smooth stone, then cut into cakes, and lastly dried in a stove until it becomes brittle; these cakes are kept in well closed bottles. The same process may be used to make a portable soup of the flesh of poultry; and aromatic herbs may be used as a seasoning, if thought proper.\n\nThese tablets or cakes may be kept four or five years. When intended to be used, the quantity of half an ounce is put into a large glass of boiling water, which is to be covered, and set upon hot ashes for a quarter of an hour, or until the whole is entirely dissolved.

It is situated at one end of a deep valley on the banks of a small rivulet, and is surrounded on all sides by high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. The sides of these mountains next to Spa are rude and uncultivated, presenting a rugged appearance as if shattered by the convulsions of earthquakes; but as they are strewed with tall oaks and abundance of shrubs, the country around forms a wild, romantic, and beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>. The access to the town\ntown is very beautiful. The road winds over the mountains till it descends to their bottom, when it runs along a smooth valley for a mile or a mile and a half.\n\nThe town consists of four streets in form of a cross, and contains about 400 inhabitants. Spa has no wealth to boast of. It can scarcely furnish the necessaries of life to its own inhabitants during the winter, and almost all the luxuries which are requisite for the great concourse of affluent visitors during the summer are carried from Liege by women. Its only source of wealth is its mineral waters. No sooner does the warm season commence, than crowds of valetudinarians arrive, as well as many other persons who are attracted solely by the love of amusement, and some from less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> motives.\n\nThe inhabitants, who spend seven or eight months of the year without seeing the face of a stranger, wait for the return of this period with impatience.

Perhaps indeed there is no place in Europe to which so many kings and princes resort; but it is also visited by many self-created nobility, who, under the titles of counts, barons, marquises, and knights, contrive by their address, and artifices, to prey upon the rich and inexperienced.\n\nThe manners established at Spa are conducive both to health and amusement. Every body rises early in the morning, at six o'clock or before it, when a great many horses stand ready saddled for those who choose to drink the Sauveniere or Geronfere waters at a little distance from Spa. After this healthy exercise a part of the company generally breakfast together at Vauxhall, a magnificent and spacious building. At this place a number of card-tables are opened every forenoon, round which many persons assemble and play for stakes to a very considerable amount. A ball too is generally held once a week at Vauxhall, besides two balls at the assembly rooms near the Poulton in the middle of the town.\n\nThe most remarkable waters at Spa are, 1. The Poulton, situated in the middle of the town; 2. The Sauveniere, a mile and a half east from it; 3. Groifbeck, near to the Sauveniere; 4. Tonnelet, situated a little to the left of the road which leads to the Sauveniere; 5. Geronfere, two miles south from Spa; 6. Warroz, near to the Tonnelet; 7. Sarts or Nivelet, in the district of Sarts; 8. Chevron or Bru, in the principality of Slavellot; 9. Couve; 10. Beverfe; 11. Sige; 12. Geremont. These four last are near Malmedy.\n\nDr Brownrigg was the first person who discovered that fixed air, or, as it is now generally called, carbonic acid gas, forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ingredient in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the Spa waters, and actually separated a quantity of this elastic fluid, by exposing it to different degrees of heat from 110\u00b0 to 170\u00b0 of Fahrenheit. From 20 ounces 7 drams and 14 grains apothecaries weight of the Poulton water, he obtained 8 ounces 2 drams and 50 grains. Since June 1765, when Dr Brownrigg read a paper on this subject before the Royal Society of London, the waters of Spa have been often analysed, but perhaps by none with more accuracy than by Dr Ash, who published a book on the chemical and medicinal properties of these waters in 1788. We shall present the result of his analysis of the five principal springs in the following table.\n\n| Fountains | Quantity of Water | Ounces of Gas | Solid contents | Aerated Lime | Aerated Magnesia | Aerated Mineral Alkali | Aerated Iron | Aerated Selenite | Aerated Vegetah | Aerated Alkali |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Pouhon    | 33               | 35.75         | 16.25          | 2.75         | 9.50            | 2.25                   | 1.75        |                |               |               |\n| Geronfere | 32.75            | 24.75         | 5.50           | 2.50         | 1.75            | 0.75                   | 0.50        |                |               |               |\n| Sauveniere| 32.50            | 33.50         | 3.75           | 1.50         | 0.75            | 0.50                   | 1           |                |               |               |\n| Groifbeck | 32.25            | 35.50         | 5.25           | 1.50         | 1               | 0.75                   |             |                |               |               |\n| Tonnelet  | 32               | 40.75         | 2.00           | 0.25         | 0.75            | 1                      |             |                |               |               |\n\nThe Pouhon spring rises from the hill to the north of Spa, which consists of argillaceous schistus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a> slate. The other fountains rise from the surrounding hills to the south-east, south-west, and north-west of the town; and this ridge of mountains is formed of calcareous earths mixed with siliceous substances. The surface of the mountains is covered with woods, interspersed with large boggy swamps filled with mud and water. The Pouhon is considered as the principal spring at Spa, being impregnated with a greater quantity of iron than any of the rest, and containing more fixed air than any except the Tonnelet. It is from this spring that the Spa water for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> is bottled; for which the demand is so great, that, according to the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> which Mr Thickneffe could obtain, the quantity exported amounts to 200,000 or 250,000 bottles annually. This exported water is inferior in its virtue to that which is drunk on the spot; for the evil effects into which it is collected are injudiciously exposed to the sun, rain, wind, and dust, for several hours before they are corked, by which means a considerable part of its volatile ingredients must be evaporated; for it has\nbeen found by experiment, that by exposing it to a gentle heat, air-bubbles ascend in great numbers. It is in its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> when collected in cold dry weather; it is then pellucid, colourless, and without smell, and almost as light as distilled water. It varies in its heat from $52^\\circ$ or $53^\\circ$ to $67^\\circ$ of Fahrenheit's thermometer.\n\nThe G\u00e9ronf\u00e8re is a much weaker chalybeate water than the Pouhon; and as it is exceedingly nauseous, and tastes and smells like rotten eggs, it certainly contains some hepatic gas. This is a circumstance which Dr Ash seems not to have attended sufficiently. The Sauvemiere water also, when newly taken from the well, smells a little of sulphur. The Groiibek contains more alkali, and almost as much gas as the Pouhon, and has been celebrated for its good effects in the case of calculous concretions. The Tonnelet contains more gas than any of the rest. So small is the quantity of any fossil body held in suspension by the aerial acid in it, and so volatile is the gas, that it begins to pass off very rapidly the moment it is taken out of the well, and in a short time is entirely gone. Dr Ash informs us, that in the neighbourhood of this well, the cellars, on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> change of weather, are found to contain much fixed air; and the best prognostic which they have of rain is the aversion which cats show to be carried into these cellars.\n\nThe Spa waters are diuretic, and sometimes purgative. They exhilarate the spirits with an influence much more benign than wine or spirituous liquors, and they are more cooling, and allay thirst more effectually than common water. They are found beneficial in cases of weakness and relaxation, either partial or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>; in nervous disorders; in obstructions of the liver and spleen; in cases where the blood is too thin and putrefied; in cases of excessive discharges proceeding from weakness; in the gravel and stone; and in most cases where a strengthening remedy is wanted. But they are hurtful in confirmed obstructions attended with fever, where there is no free outlet to the matter, as in ulcerations of the lungs. They are also injurious to bilious and plethoric constitutions, when used before the body is cooled by proper evacuations.\n\n**SPACE.** See **<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">METAPHYSICS</a>**, Part II.

This last is the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> boundary of the Spanish territory, and consists of ideal lines, except in three parts, where the river Minho to the north, and the Douro and the Chanza, till its junction with the Guadiana to the east, rather more natural limits.\n\nFrom Cape Ortegal in N. Lat. $43^\\circ 44'$, to the rock of Gibraltar, in N. Lat. $35^\\circ 57'$, the continent of Spain extends through nearly $8^\\circ$ of latitude, while its extent from west to east, viz. from Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINISTERRE\">Finisterre</a> in Long. $9^\\circ 17'$ W. from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> to Cape Creus, or Croix, in Long. $3^\\circ 30'$ E. from the same meridian, comprehends nearly $13^\\circ$ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. In British miles, its length from north to south, viz. from Cape Penas to Gibraltar, may be estimated at $550$ miles, while its medium breadth may be computed at $440$. According to De Laborde, its superficial extent, exclusive of Portugal, is $25,137$ square French leagues, or about $21,000$ square English leagues.\n\nBesides the continental part of Spain, this monarchy comprehends several islands in the Mediterranean, especially Majorca, Minorca, and Ibiza; the Canary islands, and several places on the north-western coast of Africa; the Philippine and Ladrones islands; together with an immense territory both in North and South America, comprehending Mexico, or New Spain, New Mexico, the island of Cuba, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTO_RICO\">Porto Rico</a>, &c., in North America, and in the southern part of that continent, the greatest portion of Terra Firme, Peru, Chili, almost the whole of Paraguay, with an extensive territory lying on the banks of the river Plate.\n\nThe usual division of the Spanish continent is into fourteen provinces, viz. those of Catalonia, Aragon, and Navarre, on the confines of France; Biscay, Asturias, and Galicia, on the shores of the Atlantic; Leon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTREMADURA\">Estremadura</a>, on the side of Portugal; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a> chiefly on the straits of Gibraltar; Granada, Murcia, and Valencia, on the shores of the Mediterranean; Old and New Castile in the centre.\n\nThe latest writer on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> of Spain, De Laborde, reckons only 13 provinces, as he includes Granada under Andalusia. In the following table we have brought together the most important circumstances respecting each of these provinces, viz. their subdivisions, extent in square British miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> at the end of the 18th century, and chief towns; and we have arranged the provinces in the order followed by Laborde.\n| Provinces | Subdivisions | Extent in square miles | Population | Chief Towns |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Province of Catalonia. | County of Rouffillon | 10,400 | 814,412 | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARRAGONA\">Tarragona</a>, Urgel, Lerida, Gerona, Salou, Vich, Tortola, Figueras, &c. |\n| Kingdom of Valencia. | Cerdagne | 7,800 | 932,150 | Valencia, Alicante, Elche, Orihuela, Cartagena, Alzira, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARCASSONNE\">Carcassonne</a>, Gandia, Xativa, Oti\u00f1ente, Alcoy, Segorbe, &c. |\n| Province of Estremadura. | | 16,000 | 416,922 | Badajoz, Placencia, Coria, Merida, Trujillo, Xera de los <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABALLEROS\">Caballeros</a>, Llerena, Almatona, Zafra, &c. |\n| Province of Andalusia. | Kingdom of Seville | 12,600 | 754,293 | Seville, Xeres de la Frontera, Arcos, Cadiz, Real Ejo, Ayamonte, Nivela, &c. |\n| | Granada | 4,500 | 661,661 | Granada, Malaga, Loja, Santa Fe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ANTEQUERA\">Antequera</a>, Ronda, Guadix, Baza, &c. |\n| | Cordoba | 1,080 | 236,016 | Cordoba, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHIDONA\">Archidona</a>, &c. |\n| | Jaen | 2,400 | 177,136 | Jaen, Ubeda, Baeza, Anduxar, &c. |\n| | | 8,812 | 337,686 | Murcia, Cartagena, Lorca, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINCHILLA\">Chinchilla</a>, Alba Cete, Villena, Almanza, &c. |\n| Kingdom of Murcia. | | | | Zaragoza, Jaca, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARBASTRO\">Barbastro</a>, Huesca, Tarazona, Albarracin, Teruel, &c. |\n| Kingdom of Aragon. | | 16,500 | 623,308 | Pamplona, Tudela, &c. |\n| Kingdom of Navarre. | Biscay Proper | 2,287 | 287,382 | Bilbao, Vitoria, &c. |\n| Province of Biscay. | Alava | 4,000 | 116,042 | Vitoria, Trevino, Onate, &c. |\n| | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUIPUZCOA\">Guipuzcoa</a> | | 74,900 | St Sebastian, Fuencarral, Tolosa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>, &c. |\n| | | | 12,076 | Oviedo, Aviles, Luarca, Gijon, &c. |\n| Principality of the Asturias. | Oviedo | 3,375 | 350,000 | Santillana, San Vincente, Riva de Sella, &c. |\n| | Santillana | 1,200 | | |\n| Kingdom of Galicia. | | 11,500 | 1,350,000 | San Jago de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSTELLA\">Compostella</a>, Bayona, Lugo, Orense, Mondonedo, Corunna, Vigo, &c. |\n| Kingdom of Leon. | Leon | 10,750 | 665,432 | Leon, Duero, Astorga, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMANCA\">Salamanca</a>, Zamora, &c. |\n| | Palencia | | | Burgos, Oviedo, Siguenza, Avila, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALLADOLID\">Valladolid</a>, Segovia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALAHORRA\">Calahorra</a>, Soria, &c. |\n| | Zamora | | | Madrid, Toledo, Aranjuez, Talavera della Reyna, &c. |\n| | Salamanca | | | Cuenca, Guete, Alcacon, &c. |\n| Kingdom of Old Castile. | Burgos | 10,800 | 1,190,180 | Ocana, Huclles, Laguardia, Tarazona, &c. |\n| | Avila | | | Palma, Alcudia, &c. |\n| | Segovia | | | |\n| Kingdom of New Castile. | Toledo | 22,000 | 1,146,809 | |\n| | Cuenca | | | |\n| | Lamanca | | | |\n| Kingdom of Majorca. | Islands of Majorca | 1,440 | 136,000 | |\n| | Cabrera | | | |\n| Island of Minorca. | Iviza | 110 | 27,000 | |\n| | | 360 | | |\n\nSome account of these provinces will be found under the articles Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Biscay, Castile, Catalonia, Estremadura, Galicia, Granada, Leon, Murcia, Navarre, Valencia, Iviza, Majorca and Minorca; but, for the best view of their present state, we must refer our readers to De Laborde's View of Spain, vols i. ii. and iii. or to Playfair's Geography, vol. i.\n\nIn its general appearance, Spain presents a pleasing variety of hill and dale, mountain and valley. It must be regarded as a mountainous country, its plains being few in number and of small extent. The most remarkable of these occupies the centre of the kingdom, especially New Castile, which forms the most elevated tract of level country to be found in Europe, having a mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of more than 300 fathoms above the level of the sea. The country is well wooded, and abounds with rivers; but these are often very deficient in water, and...\nSpain, especially on its eastern coast, is remarkable for the dryness of its soil. Notwithstanding this aridity, however, most parts of the kingdom teem with fertility, and native verdure and high cultivation render the scenery delightful. Here and there, indeed, occurs a tract of desert utterly incapable of cultivation; but, in general, nature has done much more for the country than the labour of its inhabitants.\n\nThe soil is said to be in general light, and easily wrought; but on many parts of the eastern coast it is composed chiefly of a stiff loam or clay. The most fertile parts of the kingdom are in Valencia, on the coast of Granada, in the kingdom of Old Castile, and in several parts of those of New Castile and Leon. The soil of Catalonia is very discouraging, except in the valleys, and the same may be said of all the provinces bordering on the Pyrenees; the soil of Extremadura, though naturally good, has been so long abandoned to itself, that it has almost ceased to produce, and that of Andalusia has a very mixed character. The soil of Murcia is uncommonly arid; that of the Asturias cold; that of Galicia extremely wet. In the neighbourhood of Cartagena there is an extensive tract, which is so covered with stones as to form a desert as sterile and untameable as any on the sandy plains of Africa or Arabia.\n\nWe have said that Spain is a mountainous country. The chain of the Pyrenees, common to it and France, is by no means the most considerable in point either of elevation or extent; though that chain may be regarded as the common root or origin of all the rest. From the western corner of the Pyrenees a vast ridge branches off through Navarre, Biscay, Asturias, and Galicia, terminating only at Cape Finisterre, and Cape Ortegal. This ridge is the Cantabrian mountains, and is distinguished into several subordinate groups, denominated from the principal towns situated in their vicinity. Thus we have the mountains of Mondonedo in Galicia. In general, these groups are called Sierras, from the jagged or serrated appearance of their tops; as the Sierra de la Aflurias, Sierra d'Avala, &c. The subordinate mountains that extend from the Sierra of the Asturias in the north, to the Alpujaras in the south, run in parallel lines; and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> prevails in the mountains of Saint Andero, which join the Pyrenees.\n\nFrom the mountains of Biscay arises a main ridge, which, after proceeding a little to the south, divides into three or four branches. Of these the most northerly chain separates the provinces of Old Castile and New Castile, extending to the confines of Portugal, and called the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUADARRAMA\">Guadarrama</a>. A second branch divides the principal part of New Castile from the province of La Mancha, running from the north-east to the south-west, as far as Badajoz in Extremadura. The most remarkable part of this chain is the Sierra of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUADALUPE\">Guadalupe</a>. South of these runs the Sierra Morena, or Sable mountains, rendered classical by the inimitable pen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CERVANTES\">Cervantes</a>. This is the last chain till we reach the Alpujaras, that extend through the provinces of Granada and Andalusia.\n\nOf these mountains there are two points, which, in elevation, exceed Mont Perdu, the highest of the Pyrenees, viz., the Pico de Venleta, in the Sierra Nevada, or snowy mountains of Granada, which is elevated more than 1784 fathoms above the level of the ocean, and the peak of Mulahaten, in the same chain, raised above 1824 fathoms, which is within 76 fathoms of the peak of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a>.\n\nThe principal capes and promontories of the Spanish continent are, Cape Creus, Cape St Antoine, opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> the island of Ibiza; Cape Palas, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a>; Cape de Gatte, near Almeria, and the promontory on which stands the town of Gibraltar, all on the coast of the Mediterranean; and Cape Machicaco, Cape Penas, Cape Ortegal, the promontory of Ferrol, Cape Finisterre, and Cape Trafalgar, on the coasts of the Atlantic.\n\nThe principal bays and gulfs on the coast of Spain, pursuing the same course, are the following; the bay gulfs of Valencia, the bay of Alicante, the gulf of Cartagena, the bay of Almeria, the bay of Gibraltar, the harbour of Cadiz, the bay of Corunna, commonly called the Groyne, and the bay of Biscay.\n\nThe rivers of Spain are intimately connected with the Rivers, mountains from which they derive their source, and between the chains of which they generally flow. The most important are, the Ebro, rising in the mountains of Santillana in the Asturias, and running in a south-eastern direction between the Castiles and Valencia on the one hand, and the provinces of Navarre, Aragon, and Catalonia, on the other, till it reaches the Mediterranean, at a small distance from Tortola; the Xacar, rising in the Sierra of Cuenca in New Castile, and flowing into the Mediterranean considerably to the southward of Valencia; the Segura, rising in a mountain of the same name, traversing the province of Murcia, and meeting the Mediterranean about midway in the capital of that province, and Alicante. These flow into the Mediterranean, and there are several other rivers of less note, which pour their waters into the same sea, and which we can merely enumerate. These are the Ter at Gerona, the Llobregate at Barcelona, and the Mi\u00f1ares, passing by Segorbe. The rivers which flow into the Atlantic are, the Guadalquivir, rising at the foot of Mount Segura, from the opposite side of which originates the river of the same name, flowing with a sluggish course through the province of Andalusia, and meeting the Atlantic a little to the north-west of Xeres; the Guadiana, rising among some lakes to the north-west of Alcaraz in New Castile, and passing between the Sierra Morena and the Sierra de Guadalupe, till, near Badajoz, it enters the kingdom of Portugal, and runs nearly in a southerly direction, till it meets the Atlantic at Ayamonte; the Tagus, rising among the mountains of Albaracin in New Castile, and running westerly till, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCANTARA\">Alcantara</a>, it becomes a river of Portugal; the Douro, rising in Old Castile near Soria, and passing by Valladolid and Zamora, near which it forms a part of the boundary of Portugal; the Minho, rising in the mountains of Galicia, and running to the south-west, till it meets the Atlantic to the north of Camina. The only other river of any importance in this direction is the Lima, supposed to be the Lethe of the poets, which rises in Galicia, and flows into the sea below Viara.\n\nIf we except the series of small lakes from which we have said the river Guadiana takes its rise, there are, in Spain, few lakes that merit particular notice. The most remarkable of these is the lake of Abulfera, in the province of Valencia. This lake begins near the village of Catarroja, about a league south of the city of Valencia, and extends nearly four leagues as far as Cullera. When\nSpain. It is full; it is about four leagues long, two in breadth, and five in circumference; but it is so shallow, that small boats can scarcely float in it. To supply the deficiency of water, an engine is employed, by which the neighboring waters are drawn into the bed of the lake; and any superabundant water occasioned by heavy rains, is carried off into the sea by means of an artificial opening. This lake contains a great many fish, and numerous aquatic birds make it their haunt. On certain days in the year the inhabitants of Valencia make incursions hither to shoot the birds, and the surface of the lake is at these times covered with boats.\n\nMany parts of the kingdom of Spain abound in large tracts of wood. Extensive forests are found in Catalonia, the Asturias, Galicia, and in the Sierra Morena. It is in the mountainous chains that the forests of Spain are most remarkable; and there are few of these heights, except in the snowy regions of the Sierra Nevada, but what are covered with wood almost to their summits.\n\nThe climate of Spain is as delightful as that of any part of Europe; and though at certain seasons of the year the eastern coast is subject to excessive heat and drought, and the north-western to almost perpetual rains, the temperature is in general mild, and the air salubrious.\n\nThe climate of Spain has been admirably depicted by M. A. de Humboldt; and we shall here present to our readers the substance of his remarks, as they are related by De Laborde, in his view of Spain.\n\nNo country of Europe presents a configuration so singular as Spain. It is this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> form which accounts for the dryness of the soil in the interior of the Castiles, for the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, the want of rivers, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of temperature which is observable between Madrid and Naples, two towns situated under the same degree of latitude.\n\nThe interior of Spain is, as we have seen, an elevated plane, which is higher than any of the same kind in Europe, occupying a large extent of country. The mean height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> at Madrid is 26 inches 2\u00bd lines. It is therefore 1\u00bd lower than the mean height of the mercury at the level of the ocean. This is the difference of the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> that is experienced by all bodies exposed to the air at Madrid, and at Cadiz and Bordeaux. At Madrid the barometer falls as low as 25 inches 6 lines, and sometimes even lower.\n\nThe following is a table of the variations in the height of the barometer during the first nine months of the year 1793.\n\n| Months | Maximum | Minimum | Mean Height of the Mercury |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------------------------|\n|        | Inches  | Lines   | Inches  | Lines   | Inches | Lines |\n| January | 26      | 5.8     | 25      | 9.8     | 26     | 2.6   |\n| February| 26      | 5.3     | 25      | 6.2     | 26     | 1.6   |\n| March   | 26      | 4.7     | 25      | 6.0     | 25     | 1.6   |\n| April   | 26      | 4.4     | 25      | 6.9     | 26     | 1.6   |\n| May     | 26      | 4.6     | 25      | 10.5    | 26     | 0.8   |\n| June    | 26      | 4.3     | 25      | 11.8    | 26     | 1.6   |\n| July    | 26      | 4.3     | 25      | 11.5    | 26     | 2.4   |\n| August  | 26      | 3.2     | 25      | 11.5    | 26     | 1.4   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>| 26     | 4.3     | 25      | 11.5    | 26     | 1.7   |\n\nFrom the mean height of the barometer at Madrid, Spain, we find that capital to be elevated 309\u00bd fathoms above the level of the ocean. Madrid, consequently, stands as high as the town of Innsbruck, situated in one of the highest defiles of the Tyrol, while its elevation is 15 times greater than that of Paris, and three times greater than that of Geneva.\n\nAccording to M. Thalacker, the mineralogist, who has taken several heights with the barometer in the environs of Madrid, the elevation of the king's palace at San <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILDEFONSO\">Ildefonso</a> is 593 fathoms, which is higher than the edge of the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and is, strictly speaking, in the regions of the clouds, which generally float from 550 to 600 fathoms high.\n\nThe height of the plain of the Castiles has an evident effect on its temperature. We are astonished at not finding oranges in the open air under the same latitude as that of Tarentum, part of Calabria, Thessaly, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia Minor</a>; but the mean temperature of Madrid is very little superior to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, Paris, and Berlin, and is nearly the same with that of Genoa and Rome. The following table shews the mean temperature at Madrid and at Rome, during the first nine months of the years 1793 and 1807.\n\n| Months | Deg. of Fahrenheit | Deg. of Fahrenheit |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| January| 39\u00b0 3             | 40\u00b0 11' 15\"       |\n| February| 43 24            | 47 49 30          |\n| March   | 47 54            | 50 15 45          |\n| April   | 52 19 30\"        | 54 34 30          |\n| May     | 59 4 30          | 65 56 15          |\n| June    | 72 32 15         | 72 30             |\n| July    | 77 13 30         | 79 15             |\n| August  | 81 34 30         | 79 15             |\n| September| 65 45           | 72 34 30          |\n\nThus, the mean temperature at Madrid appears to be 59\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, while that of the coasts of Spain, from the 41\u00b0 to the 36\u00b0 of Lat. is between 63\u00bd\u00b0 and 68\u00b0 of Fahrenheit. In the former climate we find that orange trees will not flourish in perfection, while in the latter we see banana trees, heliconias, and even sugarcanes, growing in situations that are sheltered from the cold winds.\n\nSpain presents few species of animals that are not found in the other parts of southern Europe. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>, we may remark, as peculiar to Spain, the genet, (genetta genetta). The bear is found in several parts of the great Pyrenean chain, especially on some of the mountains of Aragon, as well as those of Occar and Reynosa in Old Castile. Wolves are met with in all the higher and mountainous parts of the country, and wild boars on the mountains of Navarre, on the Pinar, and the Sierra de Carafcoy, in the kingdom of Valencia. The roebuck is found on some of the mountains of Navarre, and the lynx and the ibex on those of Cuenca in New Castile, in the valleys of Aure and Gijon, as well as in the Pyrenees. The glory of Spanish zoology is the horse, for which this kingdom has been famous in all ages. The Spanish horses\nhorses have probably originated from the Barbis of the north of Africa, supposed to be the immediate offspring of the Arabian breed. The Spanish mules are also excellent, and the ass is here no ignoble animal, though not equal to those of Arabia. There is little remarkable in the breed of cattle, but the Merino sheep have long been distinguished, and are perhaps superior to any in the world for the beauty of the fleece, if not for the delicacy of the mutton. The flocks of Merino sheep are sometimes extremely large, and Mr. Townsend mentions one nobleman who possessed not fewer than 40,000.\n\nThe whole number in the kingdom may be estimated at about 5,000,000. These animals were, by a special code, called the Moifa, authorized to travel from one province to another, according as the season presented the best pasturage in the mountains or the plains. The fleece of the Merino sheep is esteemed double in value to that of any other breed.\n\nOf the birds more peculiarly found in Spain, the vulture, pernicopterus, the cuculus glandarius, cuculus tridactyla, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOTACILLA\">motacilla</a> hispanica, hirundo mellia, and hirundo rupestris, are the most remarkable.\n\nFresh-water fishes are very plentiful in the Spanish rivers; but those in most esteem are from the small river Tormes in Old Castile, where have been taken trout of 20 lbs. weight. The tench of the lakes near Tobar in New Castile, are remarkably fine and delicate, and are taken in great abundance every year, during the months of May and June. The fish taken on the coasts are much the same as those of the other countries bordering on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The tuna was formerly taken on the eastern coast, where it formed a particular branch of the fishery, but is now, we believe, little regarded.\n\nAmong the Spanish insects, the most remarkable are, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>, (meloe sefectorius), and the kermes insect (coccus ilicis). The latter insect is much cultivated as an article of dyeing, especially in the territory of Bujalance, and of Fernan Nunes in the kingdom of Cordova, as also in the vicinity of the town of De las Aguas, four leagues from Alicante, and near the river Henares, in New Castile. The evergreen oaks on which these animals feed, present in the spring, a most singular appearance, from the red nidi of the kermes, with which their leaves are covered.\n\nNo country of Europe of the same extent, furnishes such an ample field for the researches of the botanist, as Spain; and indeed its botany constitutes a very important part of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>. The mountainous districts are clothed with the ever-green oak, the common oak, the chestnut, and in some places various species of pine; but their most useful production is the cork tree. The smaller heights produce the wild olive, the almond, the thyme, the laurel, the bay, the cypress, Canary and Portugal broom, the yellow jessamine, and the Provence rose. The vine, the palm tree, the orange, the lemon and the olive, are so nearly naturalized as to require but little cultivation; and the same may be said of the kali (saltpeter), which is produced in large quantities on the coasts, and furnishes the best kind of kelp, commonly called barilla, used in the manufacture of soap and glats. The plains and valleys are covered with many of those plants which form some of the greatest ornaments of our flower gardens, as the tulip, several species of iris, the peony, the passion flower, the orange and martagon lily, the jonquil, several species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARCISSUS\">narcissus</a> and hyacinth, and above all the rhododendron. The mountains, however, exhibit the greatest variety of botanical riches. Those most worthy of the visits and researches of the enterprising botanist, are, the Sierra de Guadalupe in Extremadura; the mountains of Moncayo in Aragon; of Pineda, Guadarrama, and Cuerca, in New Castile; of Carofoyo, in the kingdom of Murcia; of Pe\u00f1a-Colosa, Mongi, Aytona, and Mariola, in the kingdom of Valencia, and the Pyrenees.\n\nThe sugar-cane, was, before the discovery of the West India islands, one of the most important objects of Spanish cultivation, and numerous sugar mills were established along the coast of the Mediterranean, especially in the kingdom of Granada. At the conquest of that Moorish kingdom, not fewer than fourteen sugar plantations and two mills, were found within the province. Some sugar canes are still cultivated in the kingdom of Valencia, but the manufacture of sugar is discontinued, and the canes are used only for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>. There is, we believe, still a manufacture for sugar from Spanish canes in Granada.\n\nSpain has long been celebrated for the riches of its minerals, mineral kingdom, and it may still be considered as the Mexico and Peru of Europe. There are few metals which may not be found in this kingdom; and, till the discovery of America put the Spaniards in possession of mines which far surpass their own in produce, the gold and silver mines of Spain were thought to be nearly the richest in the world. At present, no gold mines are wrought, but grains of that metal are found disseminated in ferruginous quartz, forming a vein that passes through a mountain near the village of San Ildefonso in Old Castile. Spangles of gold are found intermixed with emery, in a mine near Alocer in Extremadura, and in the territory of Molena in Aragon; and this metal is occasionally found in the sand of two rivers; the Agueda, in the kingdom of Leon, which rises from the mountains of Xalama, and the Tagus in New Castile, especially in the vicinity of Toledo.\n\nSilver is much more abundant, but most of its mines have also been abandoned. We believe the only silver mine now in work, is that of the Sierra de Guadalupe, near the village of Logro\u00f1o, where the silver is found mixed with micaceous schistus. The most remarkable silver mines formerly worked are those of Alrodovado del Campo; of Zalamea on the road to Alocer in Extremadura; of Almazara near Carthagena; three in the Sierra Morena, about a league from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUADALCANAL\">Guadalcanal</a>, in the kingdom of Seville, and another about two leagues from Linarejos, in the kingdom of Jaen. This last mine was well known both to the Carthaginians and the Romans; while Spain was under the dominion of the former it belonged to Himilce, the wife of Asdrubal. After having been long abandoned, it was again wrought in the 17th century, when a vein of ore five feet in diameter was discovered; at present, however, it is no longer in a state of activity.\n\nMines of copper are found near Pamplona in Navarre, near Salva Tierra in Alava; near Escarray, and at the foot of the mountains of Guadarrama in Old Castile; near Lorea in Murcia; near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTREUSE\">Chartreuse</a> of the Val de Cristo in Valencia; in the Sierra de Guadalupe in Extremadura; in the mountains near Cordova; near Riotinto, and at la Canada de los Conejos in Seville;\nin the district of Albuladui in Granada, and near L\u00e9-\nnarez in the kingdom of Jaen.\n\nThere are numerous lead mines, especially near Tor-\ntosa in Catalonia; at Zoma, Benifiques, and Plan in\nAragon; near Logro\u00f1o and Alcofer in Extremadura;\nin the mountain Guadarrama in Old Castile; near los\nAlumbres and Lorca in Murcia; at Alcaniz and Con-\nstantina in Seville, and at the district of Linarex in\nJaen.\n\nThe mines of iron are abundant, and need not be\nenumerated. Of antimony there are two mines, both\nin the district of La Mancha. One of these is at Alen-\ndia, near Almodovar; the other at the foot of the Sier-\nra Morena. There is only one mine of cobalt, viz., in\nthe province of Aragon, found in the valley of Gefton.\nThere are two mines of cinnamon in Valencia; one about\ntwo leagues from Alicante in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> mountains of\nAlcoray; the other between Valencia and San Felipe;\nand two others in the same province, that produce native\nmercury, but none of these are worked. The most\nabundant mine of mercury and cinnamon united is in the\ndistrict of La Mancha, on the borders of Cordova.\nIt is situated in a hill of sandstone which rests on slate.\nThe whole length of the hill is traversed by two princi-\npal veins, both of which were wrought by the Romans.\nThe whole of this mine was lately wrought by the\nagents of the king, and its produce was very abundant.\n\nPlumbago is found in a thick vein intermixed with feld-\nspar, about a league from the village of Real Monasterio,\nin the kingdom of Seville. Mines of sulphur occur, both\nin Aragon and Murcia; jet has been found in the dis-\ntrict of Old Colmenar, i.e., Old Castile; and there is\ngood evidence of the presence of coal at several places\nin Catalonia, in the Asturias, New Castile, and Aragon;\nbut it is said that no coal mines have as yet been open-\ned.\n\nThe marbles of Spain are very numerous and valuable.\nA black marble, veined with white, is procured near\nBarcelona; many dendritic marbles occur near Tortosa.\nNear the town of Molina, in Aragon, is found a gra-\nnular marble spotted with red, yellow, and white. At\nthe village of Salinos, in the district of Guipuzcoa, is a\nbeautiful blue pyritical marble, containing marine shells.\nFrom Monte Sagarru, near Segorbia, in the province of\nValencia, are procured several fine marbles, which were\nheld in great estimation even by the Romans. The pro-\nvince of Granada, however, contains more valuable va-\nrieties of this beautiful mineral than all the rest of Spain;\nof these some of the principal are the following. A\npure white statuary marble, of which the whole moun-\ntain of Filabra, near Almeria, is composed; a flesh-co-\nlored marble from a mountain near Antequera; an\nexquisitely beautiful wax-coloured alabaster, from the\nvicinity of the city of Granada; and a finely veined\nmarble from the Sierra Nevada.\n\nOf the Spanish mineral waters the following are the\nmost celebrated. The principal cold springs are, a he-\npatic water in the town of Buron, in Valencia; a car-\nbonated water at Gerona, in Catalonia; a saline purga-\ntive water at Vacia-Madrid, three leagues from the ca-\npital, and another of a similar nature near Toledo.\n\nThe principal hot springs are, the baths of Abu-Zu-\nlema, at Javal-Cohol, near Brea; a hepatic spring used\nfor bathing near Alhama de Granada; another near\nAlmeria, in the province of Granada, to which are at-\ntached both bathing and vapour baths: all these were\ndiscovered, or at least brought into general use, by the\nMoors. A very copious hot spring near Merida, in\nExtremadura, made use of by the Romans. The Calda\nde Bonar, in the neighbourhood of Leon, a spring of\ntepid water frequented by the Romans, and still exhibi-\nting the ruins of baths and ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>. A\nvery hot spring near Orense, in Galicia. A spring at\nAlhama, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALATAYUD\">Calatayud</a>, in Aragon, formerly much\nfrequented, but now in a state of neglect. The Fuente\nde Buzot, near Alicante, a saline spring of the tempera-\nture of 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit. A very copious and hot\nspring at Archena, near Murcia, where still remain the\nruins of Roman and Moorish baths. A hepatic spring\nnear Armellino, in Old Castile.\n\nAmong the natural curiosities of Spain, we may parti-\ncularize the mountain of Montserrat in Catalonia (see curiosities,\nMontserrat); the insulated hill of rock felt near the\ntown of Cardona, in Catalonia (see Geology, No. 22);\nthe subterranean lake contained within a cavern in the\nneighbourhood of the Cava Perella, in the island of\nMinorca; the stalactite cave called St Michael's, on\nthe west side of the rock of Gibraltar, and the river\nGuadiana, which appears and disappears several times\nin the course of its progress to the sea.\n\nThe various groups of islands that are subject to Spain Spani-\nhave long been distinguished by particular names. Thus islands.\nMajorca, Minorca, Cabrera and Dragonera, were called\nby the ancients Insulae Baleares, and are still named\nthe Balearic Isles; while Ivi\u00e7a and Formentera form a\nlesser group, denominated the Pitiusae Isles. Of these\nislands, the latter were taken possession of by the Car-\nthaginians nearly 700 years before the Christian era;\nand about 200 years after that entering people made\nthemselves masters of the Balearic Isles. After the fall of\nCarthage, all these islands long maintained a state of\npiratical independence, and only Majorca was ever com-\npletely subject to the Romans. In the time of Augustus\nwe are told that the Balearic Isles were so infested with\nrabbits, that the inhabitants sent deputies to Rome for\nassistance to destroy these formidable invaders of their\nplantations. In the year 426 of the Christian era, these\nislands came into the possession of the Vandals, from\nwhom they were taken at the end of the 8th century\nby the African Moors. At the beginning of the 9th\ncentury they were seized on by a fleet sent into the Me-\nditerranean by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>; but they were soon after\nreconquered by the Moors, who maintained the sove-\nreignty in these islands till, in 1228, they were finally\ndispossessed by Don James grandson of Alphonso II.,\nking of Aragon.\n\nThough Spain appears to have been known to the Names of\nPhoenicians nearly 1000 years before the birth of Christ, Spain.\nit seems to have been little regarded by the Greeks till\nafter the period when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> composed his history.\nSome part of this country was probably the Tartessus of\nScripture, from which the Phoenicians imported gold,\nsilver, and other precious commodities into Judea.\nWhen the Greeks had established a colony at Marcellis,\nthey must have been well acquainted with at least the\nnorthern part of this peninsula, to which they gave the\nnames of Iberia and Celtiberia, from two nations who\nthen inhabited the country, and of Hispania, from its\nextreme situation in the west of the then known world.\nThe name Hispania, from which its modern appellation\nSpain is derived, was bestowed on it by the Romans; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> of this name is uncertain.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABORIGINES\">Aborigines</a> of Spain were doubtless a Celtic tribe, which probably passed into this peninsula from the adjoining continent of Gaul, though at a very early period they appear to have been mixed with a colony of Mauritani, or Moors from the coast of Africa. The Celtic inhabitants, or Celtiberi, seem to have possessed the northeast of the peninsula, while the Mauritani occupied the southern and south-western districts.\n\nNothing certain is known respecting the early state of Spain, till the commencement of the first Punic war between the Romans and the Carthaginians, in the middle of the third century before Christ. Not long before this date, probably at the beginning of the century, the latter people had possessed themselves of Catalonia, when their general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMILCAR_BARCAS\">Hamilcar Barcas</a> is said to have founded the city of Barceno, the modern Barcelona. The Carthaginian colony, however, seems to have been rather a mercantile than a warlike settlement, and the Celtiberi were more the allies than the subjects of their African neighbours. Of the contests carried on between the Carthaginians and the Romans, till the final subjugation of the former, and the consequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of all their territories by the Roman republic, we have given an account under the articles Carthage and Rome. We shall here briefly consider the state of Spain at the time of its occupation by the Romans, and relate the events to which that occupation gave rise, and which are less connected with the more immediate transactions of the Punic wars.\n\nAt the time of the Roman conquest, Spain, though prodigious quantities of silver had been carried out of it by the Carthaginians and Tyrians, was yet a very rich country. In the most ancient times, indeed, its riches are said to have exceeded what is related of the most wealthy country in America. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> affirms us, that when the Phoenicians first arrived in Spain, they exchanged their naval commodities for such immense quantities of silver, that their ships could neither contain nor sustain its load, though they used it for ballast, and made their anchors and other implements of silver. When the Carthaginians first came to Spain, they found the quantity of silver nothing lessened, since the inhabitants at that time made all their utensils, and even mangers, of that precious metal. In the time of the Romans this amazing plenty was very much diminished; however, their gleanings were by no means despisable, since in the space of nine years they carried off 111,542 pounds of silver, and 4995 of gold, besides an immense quantity of coin and other things of value (A). The Spaniards were always remarkable for their bravery, and some of Hannibal's best troops were brought from thence; but as the Romans penetrated farther into the country than the Carthaginians had done, they met with nations whose love of liberty was equal to their valour, and whom the whole strength of their empire was scarcely able to subdue. Of these the most formidable were the Numantines, Cantabrians, and Asturians.\n\nIn the time of the third Punic war, one Viriathus, a celebrated hunter, and afterwards the captain of a gang of banditti, took upon him the command of some Numantines who had been in alliance with Carthage, and ventured to oppose the Roman power in that part of Spain called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUSITANIA\">Lusitania</a>, now Portugal. The praetor, named Veillius, who commanded in those parts, marched against him with 10,000 men; but was defeated and killed, with the loss of 4000 of his troops. The Romans immediately dispatched another praetor with 10,000 foot and 1300 horse: but Viriathus having first cut off a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of 4000 of them, engaged the rest in a pitched battle; and having entirely defeated them, reduced great part of the country. Another praetor, who was sent with a new army, met with the same fate; so that, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of Carthage, the Romans thought proper to send a consul named Quintus Fabius, who defeated the Lusitanians in several battles, and regained two important places which had long been in the hands of the rebels. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of Fabius's consulship, Viriathus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> the war with his usual success, till the senate thought proper to send against him the consul Q. Caecilius Metellus, an officer of great valour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. With him Viriathus did not choose to venture a pitched battle, but contented himself with acting on the defensive; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which the Romans recovered a great many cities, and the whole of Tarraconian Spain was obliged to submit to their yoke. The other consul, named Servilianus, did not meet with the same success; his army was defeated in the field, and his camp was nearly taken by Viriathus. Notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> of Metellus, however, he could not withstand the intrigues of his countrymen against him, and he was not allowed to finish the war he had begun with so much success. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> for this he took all imaginable pains to weaken the army under his command: he disbanded the flower of his troops, exhausted the magazines, let the elephants die, broke in pieces the arrows which had been provided for the Cretan archers, and threw them into a river. Yet, after all, the army which he gave up to his successor Q. Pompeius, consisting of 30,000 foot and 2000 horse, was sufficient to have crushed Viriathus if the general had known how to use it. But, instead of opposing Viriathus with success, the imprudent consul procured much more formidable enemies. The Termantians and Numantines, who had hitherto kept themselves independent, offered very advantageous terms of peace and alliance with Rome; but Pompeius insisted on their delivering up their arms. Upon this war was immediately commenced. The consul with great confidence invested Numantia; but being repulsed with considerable loss, he sat down before Termantia, where he was attended with still worse success. The very first day, the Termantines killed 700 of his legionaries; took a great convoy which was coming to\n\n(A) In this account we must allow something for the exaggerations of fabulous historians. There is no doubt, however, that Spain was at this time immensely rich, and if we may believe Strabo, there was then a mine near Carthage which yielded every day 25,000 drams of silver, or about 300,000l. per annum.\nSpain. The Roman camp; and having defeated a considerable body of their horse, pushed them from post to post till they came to the edge of a precipice, where they all tumbled down, and were dashed to pieces. In the mean time Servilius, who had been continued in his command with the title of proconsul, managed matters so ill, that Viriathus surrounded him on all sides, and obliged him to sue for peace. The terms offered to the Romans were very moderate; being only that Viriathus should keep the country he at that time possessed, and the Romans remain masters of all the rest. This peace the proconsul was very glad to sign, and afterwards procured its ratification by the senate and people of Rome.\n\nThe next year Q. Pompeius was continued in his command against the Numantines in Farther Spain, while Q. Servilius Cepio, the new consul, had for his province Hither Spain, where Viriathus had established his new state. Pompeius undertook to reduce Numantia by turning aside the stream of the Durius, now the Douro, by which it was supplied with water; but, in attempting this, such numbers of his men were cut off, that, finding himself unable to contend with the enemy, he was glad to make peace with them on much worse terms than they had offered of their own accord. The peace, however, was ratified at Rome; but in the meantime Cepio, desirous of showing his prowess against the renowned Viriathus, prevailed on the Romans to declare war against him without any provocation. As Cepio commanded an army greatly superior to the Lusitanians, Viriathus thought proper to sue for peace; but finding that Cepio would be satisfied with nothing less than a surrender at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>, he resolved to stand his ground. In the mean time, the latter having bribed some of the intimate companions of Viriathus to murder him in his sleep, he by that infamous method put an end to a war which had lasted 14 years, very little to the honour of the republic.\n\nAfter the death of Viriathus, the Romans with like treachery ordered their new consul Popilius to break the treaty with the Numantines. His infamous conduct met with the reward it deserved; the Numantines lying out, put the whole Roman army to flight with such slaughter, that they were in no condition to act during the whole campaign. Manlius, who succeeded Popilius, met with still worse success; his great army, consisting of 30,000 men, was utterly defeated by 4500 Numantines, and 20,000 of them killed in the pursuit. The remaining 10,000, with their general, were pent up by the Numantines in such a manner that they could neither advance nor retreat, and would certainly have been all put to the sword or made prisoners, had not the Numantines, with a generosity which their enemies never possessed, offered to let them depart upon condition that a treaty should be concluded with them upon very moderate terms. This the consul very willingly promised, but found himself unable to perform. On the contrary, the people, not satisfied with declaring his treaty null and void, ordered him to be delivered up to the Numantines. The latter refused to accept him, unless he had along with him the 10,000 men whom they had relieved as before related. At last, after the consul had remained a whole day before the city, his successor Furius, thinking this a sufficient recompense to the Numantines for breaking the treaty, ordered him to be received again into the camp. However, Furius did not chuse to engage with such a desperate and resolute enemy as the Numantines had showed themselves; and the war with them was discontinued till the year 133 B.C., when Scipio Emilianus, the destroyer of Carthage, was sent against them. Against this renowned general the Numantines with all their valour were not able to contend. Scipio, having with the utmost care introduced strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> among his troops, and reformed the abuses which his predecessors had suffered in their armies, by degrees brought the Romans to face their enemies, which at his arrival they had absolutely refused to do. Having then ravaged all the country round the town, it was soon blocked up on all sides, and the inhabitants began to feel the want of provisions. At last they resolved to make one desperate attempt for their liberty, and either to break through their enemies, or perish in the attempt. With this view they marched out in good order by two gates, and fell upon the works of the Romans with the utmost fury. The Romans, unable to stand this desperate shock, were on the point of yielding, when Scipio, hurrying to the places attacked, with no fewer than 20,000 men, the unhappy Numantines were at last driven into the city, where they sustained for a little longer the miseries of famine. Finding at last, however, that it was altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to hold out, it was resolved by the majority to submit to the pleasure of the Roman commander. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> was not universally approved. Many shut themselves up in their houses, and died of hunger, while even those who had agreed to surrender repented their offer, and setting fire to their houses, perished in the flames with their wives and children, so that not a single Numantine was left alive to grace the triumph of the conqueror of Carthage.\n\nAfter the destruction of Numantia the whole of Spain submitted to the Roman yoke; and nothing remarkable happened till the times of the Cimbri, when a pretorian army was cut off in Spain by the Lusitanians. From this time nothing remarkable occurs in the history of Spain till the civil war between Marius and Sylla. The latter having crushed the Marian faction, as related under the article ROMA, proscribed all those that had sided against him whom he could not immediately destroy.\n\nAmong these was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SERTORIUS\">Sertorius</a>, a man of consummate valour and experience in war. He had been appointed praetor of Spain by Marius; and upon the overthrow of Marius, retired to that province. Sylla no sooner heard of his arrival in that country, than he lent thither one Caius Annius with a powerful army to drive him out. As Sertorius had but few troops along with him, he dispatched one Julius Salinator with a body of 6000 men to guard the passes of the Pyrenees, and to prevent Annius from entering the country. But Salinator having been treacherously murdered by assassins hired by Annius for that purpose, he no longer met with any obstacle; and Sertorius was obliged to embark for the coast of Africa with 3000 men, being all out, and he had now remaining. With these he landed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a>; but as his men were straggling carelessly about, many hard great numbers of them were cut off by the Barbarians. This new misfortune obliged Sertorius to re-embark for Spain; but finding the whole coast lined with the troops of Annius, he put to sea again, not knowing what course to steer. In this new voyage he met with a small fleet of Cilician pirates; and having prevailed\nwith them to join him, he made a descent on the coast of Ivi\u00e7a, overpowered the garrison left there by Annius, and gained a considerable booty. On the news of this victory Annius set sail for Ivi\u00e7a, with a considerable squadron, having 5000 land forces on board. Sertorius, not intimidated by the superiority of the enemy, prepared to give them battle. But a violent storm arising, most of the ships were driven on shore and dashed to pieces, Sertorius himself with great difficulty escaping with the small remains of his fleet. For some time he continued in great danger, being prevented from putting to sea by the fury of the waves, and from landing by the enemy; at last, the storm abating, he passed the straits of Gades, now Gibraltar, and landed near the mouth of the river Betis. Here he met with some seamen newly arrived from the Atlantic or Fortunate islands; and was so charmed with the account which they gave him of those happy regions, that he resolved to retire thither to spend the rest of his life in quiet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. But having communicated this design to the Cilician pirates, they immediately abandoned him, and set sail for Africa, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to assist one of the barbarous kings against his subjects who had rebelled. Upon this Sertorius sailed thither also, but took the opposite side; and having defeated the king named Acalais, obliged him to flit himself up in the city of Tingis, now Tangier, which he closely besieged.\n\nBut in the mean time Pacianus, who had been sent by Sylla to assist the king, advanced with a considerable army against Sertorius. Upon this the latter, leaving part of his forces before the city, marched with the rest to meet Pacianus, whose army, though greatly superior to his own in number, he entirely defeated; killed the general, and took all his forces prisoners.\u2014The fame of this victory soon reached Spain; and the Lusitanians, being threatened with a new war from Annius, invited Sertorius to head their armies. With this request he very readily complied, and soon became very formidable to the Romans. Titus Didius, governor of that part of Spain called Betica, first entered the lists with him; but being defeated, Sylla next dispatched Metellus, reckoned one of the best commanders in Rome, to stop the progress of this new enemy. But Metellus, notwithstanding all his experience, knew not how to act against Sertorius, who was continually changing his situation, putting his army into new forms, and contriving new stratagems. On his first arrival he sent for L. Domitius, then praetor of Hither Spain, to his assistance; but Sertorius being informed of his march, detached Hirtuleius, or Herculeius, his quaestor, against him, who gave him a total overthrow. Metellus then dispatched Lucius Lollius praetor of Narbonne Gaul against Hirtuleius; but he met with no better success, being utterly defeated, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general killed.\n\nThe fame of these victories brought to the camp of Sertorius such a number of illustrious Roman citizens of the Marian faction, that he formed a design of erecting Lusitania into a republic in opposition to that of Rome. Sylla was continually sending fresh supplies to Metellus; but Sertorius with a handful of men, accustomed to range about the mountains, to endure hunger and thirst, and live exposed to the inclemencies of the weather, so harassed the Roman army, that Metellus himself began to be quite discouraged. At last, Sertorius hearing that Metellus had spoken disrespectfully of his courage, challenged his antagonist to end the war by single combat; but Metellus very prudently declined the combat, as being advanced in years; yet this refusal brought upon him the contempt of the unthinking multitude, upon which Metellus resolved to retrieve his reputation by some signal exploit, and therefore laid siege to Lacobriga, a considerable city in those parts. This he hoped to reduce in two days, as being there was but one well in the place; but Sertorius having previously removed all those who could be of no service during the siege, and conveyed 6000 skins full of water into the city, Metellus continued a long time before it without making any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. At last, his provisions being almost spent, he sent out Aquinas at the head of 6000 men to procure a new supply; but Sertorius falling unexpectedly upon them, cut in pieces or took the whole detachment; the commander himself being the only man who escaped to carry the news of the disaster; upon which Metellus was obliged to raise the siege with disgrace.\n\nAnd now Sertorius, having gained some intervals of civilizing the Lusitanians in consequence of the many advantages he had obtained over the Romans, began to civilize his new subjects. Their savage and furious manner of fighting he changed for the regular order and discipline of a well-formed army; he bestowed liberally upon them gold and silver to adorn their arms, and by conversing familiarly with them, prevailed with them to lay aside their own dress for the Roman toga. He sent for all the children of the principal people, and placed them in the great city of Olca, now Huecfa, in the kingdom of Aragon, where he appointed them masters to instruct them in the Roman and Greek learning, that they might, as he pretended, be capable of sharing with him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the republic. Thus he made them really hostages for the good behaviour of their parents; however, the latter were greatly pleased with the care he took of their children, and all Lusitaria were in the highest degree attached to their new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> he took care to heighten by the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>; for having procured a young hind of a milk-white colour, he made it so tame that it followed him wherever he went; and Sertorius gave out to the ignorant multitude, that this hind was inspired by Diana, and revealed to him the designs of his enemies, of which he always took care to be well informed by the great numbers of spies whom he employed.\n\nWhile Sertorius was thus employed in establishing his authority, the republic of Rome, alarmed at his success, resolved to crush him at all events. Sylla was now dead, and all the eminent generals in Rome solicited this honourable though dangerous employment. After much debate a decree was passed in favour of Pompey Great, but without recalling Metellus. In the meantime, the troops of one Perperna, or Perperna, had, in spite of all that their general could do, abandoned him, and taken the oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Sertorius. This was a most signal advantage to Sertorius; for Perperna commanded an army of 33,000 men, and had come into Spain with a design to settle there as Sertorius had done; but as he was descended from one of the first families of Rome, he thought it below his dignity to serve under any general, however eminent he might be. But the troops of Perperna were of a different opinion; and therefore declaring that they would serve\nSpain. serve none but a general who could defend himself, they to a man joined Sertorius; upon which Perperna himself finding he could do no better, consented to serve also as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a>.\n\nOn the arrival of Pompey in Spain, several of the cities which had hitherto continued faithful to Sertorius began to waver; upon which the latter resolved, by some signal exploit, to convince them that Pompey could no more force them from his resentment than Metellus. With this view he laid siege to Lauron, now Lirias, a place of considerable strength. Pompey, not doubting but he should be able to raise the siege, marched quite up to the enemy's lines, and found means to inform the garrison that those who besieged them were themselves besieged, and would soon be obliged to retire with loss and disgrace. On hearing this message, \"I will teach Sylla's disciple (said Sertorius), that it is the duty of a general to look behind as well as before him.\" Having thus spoken, he sent orders to a detachment of 6000 men, who lay concealed among the mountains, to come down and fall upon his rear if he should offer to force the lines. Pompey, surprized at their sudden appearance, durst not stir out of his camp; and in the mean time the besieged, despairing of relief, surrendered at discretion; upon which Sertorius granted them their lives and liberty, but reduced their city to ashes.\n\nWhile Sertorius was thus successfully contending with Pompey, his quator Hirtuleius was entirely defeated by Metellus, with the loss of 42,000 men; upon which Sertorius advanced with the utmost expedition to the banks of the Sueo in Tarraconian Spain, with a design to attack Pompey before he could be joined by Metellus. Pompey, on his part, did not decline the combat; but, fearing that Metellus might share the glory of the victory, advanced with the greatest expedition. Sertorius put off the battle till towards the evening; Pompey, though he knew that the night would prove disadvantageous to him, whether vanquished or victorious, because his troops were unacquainted with the country, resolved to venture an engagement, especially as he feared that Metellus might arrive in the mean time, and rob him of part of the glory of conquering so great a commander. Pompey, who commanded his own right wing, soon obliged Perperna, who commanded Sertorius's left, to give way. Hereupon Sertorius himself, taking upon him the command of that wing, brought back the fugitives to the charge, and obliged Pompey to fly in his turn. In his flight he was overtaken by a gigantic African, who had already lifted up his hand to discharge a blow at him with his broad sword; but Pompey prevented him by cutting off his right hand at one blow. As he still continued his flight, he was wounded and thrown from his horse; so that he would certainly have been taken prisoner, had not the Africans who pursued him quarrelled about the rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> of his horse. This gave an opportunity to the general to make his escape; so that at length he reached his camp with much difficulty. But in the mean time Afranius, who commanded the left wing of the Roman army, had entirely defeated the wing which Sertorius had left, and even pursued them so close that he entered the camp along with them. Sertorius, returning suddenly, found the Romans busy in plundering the tents; when taking advantage of their situation, he drove them out with great slaughter, and retook their camp. Next day he offered battle a second time to Pompey; but Metellus then coming up with all his forces, he thought proper to decline an engagement with both commanders. In a few days, however, Pompey and Metellus agreed to attack the camp of Sertorius. The event was similar to that of the former battle; Metellus defeated Perperna, and Sertorius routed Pompey. Being then informed of Perperna's misfortune, he hastened to his relief; rallied the fugitives, and repulsed Metellus in his turn, wounded him with his lance, and would certainly have killed him, had not the Romans, ashamed to leave their general in distress, hastened to his assistance, and renewed the fight with great fury. At last Sertorius was obliged to quit the field, and retire to the mountains. Pompey and Metellus hastened to besiege him; but while they were forming their camp, Sertorius broke through their driven lines, and escaped into Lusitania. Here he soon raised Spain by such a powerful army, that the Roman generals, with their united forces, did not think proper to venture an engagement with him. They could not, however, resist the perpetual attacks of Sertorius, who now drove them from place to place, till he obliged them to separate; the one went into Gaul, and the other to the foot of the Pyrenees.\n\nThus did this celebrated commander triumph over all the power of the Romans; and there is little doubt but he would have continued to make head against all the other generals whom the republic could have sent, had he not been assassinated at an entertainment by the infamous treachery of Perperna, in 73 B.C., after he had made head against the Roman forces for almost 10 years. Pompey was no sooner informed of his death, than, without waiting for any new succours, he marched against the traitor, whom he easily defeated and took prisoner; and having caused him to be executed, thus put an end, with very little glory, to a most dangerous war.\n\nMany of the Spanish nations, however, still continued to bear the Roman yoke with great impatience; and as the civil wars which took place first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and afterwards between Octavianus and Antony, diverted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the republic from Spain, by the time that Augustus had become sole master of the Roman empire, they were again in a condition to assert their liberty. The Cantabrians and Asturians were the most powerful and valiant nations at that time in Spain; but, after incredible efforts, they were obliged to lay down their arms, or rather were almost exterminated by Agrippa, as related under these articles.\n\nWhen the Romans first became masters of the western Spain under the name of Hispania, it was divided into two provinces, called Citerior and Ulterior, which were governed, sometimes by praetors, and sometimes by proconsuls. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the empire by Augustus, Hispania Citerior contained the modern provinces of Galicia, the Asturias, Biscay, Navarre, Leon, the two Castiles, Aragon, Catalonia, Murcia, and Valencia; and was denominated Provincia Tarracoensis, from the city of Tarragona in Catalonia, which was then the seat of government. Hispania Ulterior was subdivided into Baetica, including the provinces now called Granada and...\nSpain, and Andalusia; and Lusitania, comprehending the greatest part of Extremadura, and the modern kingdom of Portugal. The province called Tarracoensis was then inhabited by the following tribes, viz. the Ausetani, occupying the sea coast, at the north east, between the Ter and the Llobregat, and having for their capital Germa; the Ceretani, inhabiting the district of Cerdena, at the foot of the Pyrenees, whose capital was Julia, the modern Llivia; the Valactani, occupying the sea coast between the rivers Ter and Llobregat, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Ausetani, and whose capital was Barcelona; the Costani to the left of the mouth of the Ebro, with Tarragona for their capital; the Locetani, on the left bank of the river Sicoris; the Illergetes, extending from that river to the small stream Gallego, which joins the Ebro near Zaragoza, whose capital was Lerida; the Jacetani in the northern extremity of Aragon, having their seat of government at Jaca; the Vascenes in Navarre, and the Varduii in the modern Guipuzcoa. These nations occupied the southern and eastern parts of the province. The northern was policed by the Carifili, the Oltregonii, both in Biscay; the Cantabri, cantoned near the source of the Ebro, and along the bay of Biscay; the Asturii in Asturias and part of Leon; the Callicai in Galicia; the Vaccei along the Douro; the Arcabaci in Old Castile; the Celtiberi, between the Ebro and the source of the Tagus, and many others of inferior note.\n\nLusitania was held by three principal tribes, the Lusitanii, occupying the greater part of the province, and having for their capital the modern Lisbon; the Vettones and the Celtici.\n\nBaetica was inhabited by the Turdetani, the Turduli, the Baeticani, and the Baetuli.\n\nAll these districts, with their principal towns, are minutely treated of by Dr Playfair, in the first volume of his geography.\n\nWhen incorporated with the Roman empire, Spain partook of its tranquillity, and received in exchange for her liberty, at least, laws and a mild government. If she could not prevent herself from falling under the dominion of the masters of the world, she was at least the most powerful, the richest, and the happiest province of their empire. Columella has left us an interesting account of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> under the first emperors. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> of her ancient population is probably exaggerated, but the ruins of several towns prove it to have been considerable. It was increased by a great many Roman families after the conquest; several legions were established in Spain; 25 colonies were distributed in the most fertile parts of the country, and intermarried with the inhabitants. After a while the Spaniards, feeling in their masters only countrymen, were the first to solicit the rights of Roman citizens, by which they were completely consolidated. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNICIPAL\">municipal</a> towns went so far as to desire permission to take the title of colonies, though in the change they lost their independence, nearly in the same manner as certain proprietors of lands under the feudal system converted their domains into fiefs, in order to enjoy the honours attached to them. The government was, in general, milder in Spain than in the other Roman provinces. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> was carried on in the towns by magistrates named by themselves, and the different provinces were under the superintendence of praetors, proconsuls, and legates or deputies, according to the different eras of the Roman empire; those in their respective departments took care of all the works of public utility, the aqueducts, baths, circuses, and highways, whose magnificent ruins are still existing; but they were principally employed in collecting the revenues of the state, which were singularly analogous to those of the present times. They principally arose from dues, fines, or alienations of property, and the produce of the mines. Spain at that time drew from her own mines the same riches she now draws from the new world, and they were distributed in nearly the same manner. One part belonged to the state, and the other to the inhabitants of the country, who paid a certain duty on the metals which they procured from the mines. Their returns went on increasing, and depended entirely on the number of hands which could be devoted to work in the mines. An employment, so laborious, however, which required a numerous population, tended to diminish that population by the excessive fatigues which it occasioned. Agriculture also suffered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of estates in the hands of a few wealthy landholders. By the little attention paid to it by the proprietors, and by the defects inseparable from the system of cultivation by means of slaves, commerce and industry languished; and Spain, after having shared in the splendor of the Roman empire, was beginning to participate in its decline, when a new calamity, by completing her ruin, prepared her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENERATION\">regeneration</a>.\n\nThis calamity was the irruption of the northern hordes, which soon involved Spain in the general attack. This province was invaded first by the Franks, who in the third century had entered Gaul with a formidable force.\n\nThe Rhine, though dignified by the title of Safeguard of the Provinces, was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> barrier against the daring spirit of enterprise with which the Franks were actuated. Their rapid devastations stretched from the river to the foot of the Pyrenees; nor were they stopped by those mountains. Spain, which had never dreaded, was unable to resist the inroads of the Germans. During 12 years, the greatest part of the reign of Gallienus, that opulent country was the theatre of unequal and destructive hostilities. Tarragona, the flourishing capital of a peaceful province, was sacked and almost destroyed; and so late as the days of Orosius, who wrote in the 5th century, wretched cottages, scattered amidst the ruins of magnificent cities, still recorded the rage of the barbarians. When the exhausted country no longer supplied a variety of plunder, the Franks seized on some vessels, and retreated to Mauritania.\n\nThe situation of Spain, separated, on all sides, from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and, by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of 400 years, Spain furnished very few materials to the history of the Roman empire. The footsteps of the Barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the 4th century of the Christian era, the cities of Emerita or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracava, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the Roman world.\nSpain. The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade. The arts and sciences flourished under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of the emperors; and if the character of the Spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour. As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the Barbarians. But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post to the Honorian bands, in the service of Constantine, than the gates of Spain were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the fall of Rome by the Goths. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of Africa. The misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> writers. \"The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities; as the Barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the Spaniards; and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country. The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated, by the taste of blood, and the impatience of hunger, boldly to attack and devour their human prey. Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of famine; a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends. At length the Barbarians, fatigued with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evil which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country. The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Cafile, was divided between the Suevi and the Vandals, the Alani were scattered over the provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania, and from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic ocean; and the fruitful territory of B\u00e6cia was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the Vandalic nation. After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people. The greatest part of the Spaniards was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a>, to the severe oppressions of the Roman government; yet there were many who still adhered their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Galicia, to submit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARIAN\">barbarian</a> yoke.\"\n\nThe important prefect of the heads of Jovinus and Sebastian, had approved the friendship of Adolphus, and restored Gaul to the obedience of his brother Honorius. Peace was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths. He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of Constantius intercepted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the sea-ports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees. He passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona. The fondness of Adolphus for his Roman bride, Placidia, was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, named, from his illustrious grandfathers, Theodorus, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the republic. The loss of this infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the Gothic king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason. He had imprudently received into his service one of the followers of Sarus; a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> stature; whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron, was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master. Adolphus was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction; and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of Sarus himself, was seated on the Gothic throne. The first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the six children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop. The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>, which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult. The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above 12 miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of a husband whom Placidia loved and lamented.\n\nBut Placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse by the indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURPATION\">usurpation</a>. After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the Gothic sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic. He marched, in arms, from Barcelona to the shores of the Atlantic ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world. But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, and, from the rock now covered by the fortresses of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, Wallia refused the designs of conquest, which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric. The winds and waves disappointed the enterprises of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks. In this disposition, the successor of Adolphus no longer refused to listen to a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius. A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed; Placidia was honourably restored to her brother; 600,000 measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths; and Wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire. A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have...\nSpain have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the western emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest; the events of which must be favourable to the Romans, by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies. The Spanish war was obstinately supported, during three campaigns, with desperate valour, and various success; and the martial achievements of Wallia diffused through the empire the superior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica. He slew in battle the king of the Alani; and the remains of those Scythian wanderers, who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded. The Vandals themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths. The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Galicia, where they still continued, in a narrow compass, and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities. In the pride of victory, Wallia was faithful to his engagements; he restored his Spanish conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude. While the event of the war was still doubtful, the first advantages obtained by the arms of Wallia, had encouraged the court of Ravenna to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign. He entered Rome like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of ferocious corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets, orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage, of the emperor Honorius.\n\nAfter the retreat of the Goths, the authority of Honorius had obtained a precarious establishment in Spain; except only in the province of Galicia, where the Suevi and the Vandals had fortified their camps, in mutual discord, and hostile independence. The Vandals prevailed; and their adversaries were besieged in the Nervanac hills, between Leon and Oviedo, till the approach of Count Attilius compelled, or rather provoked, the victorious barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the plains of Baetica. The rapid progress of the Vandals soon required a more effectual opposition; and the master-general Cofinus marched against them with a numerous army of Romans and Goths. Vanquished in battle by an inferior enemy, Cofinus fled with dishonour to Tarragona; and this memorable defeat, which has been represented as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, was most probably the effect, of his rash presumption. Seville and Carthagena became the reward, or rather the prey, of the ferocious conquerors; and the vessels which they found in the harbour of Carthagena, might easily transport them to the isles of Majorca and Minorca, where the Spanish fugitives, as in a secure recess, had vainly concealed their families and their fortunes. The experience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, and perhaps the prospect of Africa, encouraged the Vandals to accept the invitation which they received from Count Boniface; and the death of Gonderic served only to forward and animate the bold enterprise. In the room of a prince, not conspicuous for any superior powers of the mind or body, they acquired his bastard brother, the terrible Genteric; a name which, in the destruction of the Roman empire, has deserved an equal rank with the names of Attila and Attila. Almost in the moment of his departure he was informed, that Hermanric, king of the Suevi, had presumed to ravage the Spanish territories, which he was resolved to abandon. Impatient of the insult, Genteric pursued the hasty retreat of the Suevi as far as Merida; precipitated the king and his army unto the river Anas, and calmly returned to the sea shore, to embark his victorious troops. The vessels which transported the Vandals over the modern straits of Gibraltar, a channel only twelve miles in breadth, were furnished by the Spaniards, who anxiously wished their departure; and by the African general, who had implored their formidable assistance.\n\nWhen Theodoric king of the Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume the purple, he offered his person and his forces, as a faithful soldier of the republic. The exploits of Theodoric soon convinced the world, that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. After the establishment of the Goths in Aquitain, and the passage of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their kingdom in Galicia, aspired to the conquest of Spain, and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona, afflicted by an hostile invasion, represented their injuries and their apprehensions. Count Fronto was dispatched, in the name of the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and alliance; and Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation, to declare that, unless his brother-in-law, the king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he should be obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome. \"Tell him,\" replied the haughty Rechiarius, \"that I despise his friendship and his arms; but that I shall soon try, whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Thoulouse.\" Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold designs of his enemy: He passed the Pyrenees at the head of the Visigoths; the Franks and Burgundians served under his standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors, the absolute possession of his Spanish conquests. The two armies, or rather the two nations, encountered each other on the banks of the river Urbius, about 12 miles from Astorga; and the decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have extinguished the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the field of battle Theodoric advanced to Braga, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, which still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and dignity. His entrance was not polluted with blood, and the Goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more especially of the consecrated virgins; but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage. The unfortunate king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean; but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight; he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a>, the death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his victorious\nvictorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the miraculous powers of St Eulalia; but he was flopped in the full career of success, and recalled from Spain, before he could provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards the Pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed; and in the sack of Pallentia and Alborga, he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel enemy.\n\nRecared was the first Catholic king of Spain. He had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate brother, and he supported it with more prudence and success. Instead of revolting against his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his death. Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed, that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and recommended to his son the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of the Gothic nation. To accomplish that salutary end, Recared convened an assembly of the Arian clergy and nobles, declared himself a Catholic, and exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince. The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited endless controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate audience, two substantial and visible arguments, the testimony of Earth and of Heaven. The Earth had submitted to the Nicaean creed: the Romans, the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of Spain, unanimously professed the same orthodox creed; and the Visigoths refused, almost alone, the consent of the Christian world. A superstitious age was prepared to reverence, as the testimony of Heaven, the preternatural cures which were performed by the skill or virtue of the Catholic clergy; the baptismal fonts of Oset in Baetica, which were spontaneously replenished each year, on the vigil of Easter; and the miraculous shrine of St Martin of Tours, which had already converted the Suevic prince and people of Galicia. The Catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important change of the national religion. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, secretly fomented by the queen-dowager, was formed against his life; and two counts excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul. But Recared disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and executed severe justice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand with the reproach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>. Eight bishops, whose names betray their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which they had been purposely collected. The whole body of the Visigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>; the faith, at least, of the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, was fervent and sincere; and the devout liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of Spain. Seventy bishops assembled in the council of Toledo, received the submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards improved the Nicaean creed, by declaring the profession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty point of doctrine, which produced, long afterwards, the schism of the Greek and Latin churches. The royal proleptic immediately saluted and consulted Pope Gregory, summoned the Great, a learned and holy prelate, whose reign was distinguished by the conversion of heretics and infidels. The ambassadors of Recared respectfully offered, on the threshold of the Vatican his rich presents of gold and gems; they accepted, as a lucrative exchange, the hairs of St John the Baptist; Gibbon's croix, which inclosed a small piece of the true wood; and a key, that contained some particles of iron which had been scraped from the chains of St Peter.\n\nAfter their conversion from idolatry or heresy, the legislative Franks and the Visigoths were disposed to embrace assemblies with equal submission, the inherent evils, and the accidental benefits of superstition. But the prelates of Spain, France, long before the extinction of the Merovingian race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting barbarians. They damned the use of synods; forgot the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> and chastity, and preferred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of private ambition and luxury, to the greatest interest of the sacerdotal profession. The bishops of Spain respected themselves, and were respected by the public: their indissoluble union dignified their vices, and confirmed their authority; and the regular discipline of the church introduced peace, order, and stability into the government of the state. From the reign of Recared, the first Catholic king, to that of Witiza, the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> of the unfortunate Roderic, fifteen national councils were successively convened. The six metropolitans, Toledo, Seville, Merida, Braga, Tarragona and Narbonne, presided according to their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFRAGAN\">suffragan</a> bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies; and a place was assigned to the most holy, or opulent, of the Spanish abbots. During the first three days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>, as long as they agitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> questions of doctrine and discipline, the profane laity was excluded from their debates; which were conducted, however, with decent solemnity. But, on the morning of the fourth day, the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the Gothic nobles; and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the consent of the people. The same rules were observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> assemblies, the annual synods, which were empowered to hear complaints, and to redress grievances; and a legal government was supported by the prevailing influence of the Spanish clergy. The bishops who, in each revolution, were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to insult the prostrate, laboured, with diligence and success, to kindle the flames of persecution, and to exalt the throne above the crown. Yet the national councils of Toledo, in which the free spirit of the Barbarians was tempered, and guided by episcopal policy, have established some prudent laws for the benefit of the king and people. The vacancy of the throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and palatines; and after the failure of the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who anointed their lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes practised, the duty of allegiance; and the spiritual censures were denounced on the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent union, the chastity even of his widow. But the monarch himself, when he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his people, that he would faithfully execute his important trust. The real or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to\nthe control of a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOCRACY\">aristocracy</a>; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> privilege that they should not be degraded, imprisoned, tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or confiscation, unless by the free and public judgement of their peers.\n\nOne of these legislative councils of Toledo, examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of Gothic kings, from the fierce Eurice, to the devout Egica. As long as the Visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors, they indulged their subjects of Aquitaine and Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law. Their gradual improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion, encouraged them to imitate, and to supercede, these foreign institutions, and to compose a code of civil and criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>, for the use of a great and united people. The same obligations, and the same privileges, were communicated to the nations of the Spanish monarchy; and the conquerors, inflexibly renouncing the Teutonic idiom, submitted to the restraints of equity, and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom. The merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation of Spain, under the reign of the Visigoths. The provincials were long separated from their Arian masters, by the irreconcilable difference of religion. After the conversion of Recared had removed the prejudices of the Catholics, the coasts, both of the ocean and Mediterranean, were still possessed by the Eastern emperors, who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of Roman citizens. The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by their own persuasion, that they hazard more in a revolt, than they can hope to obtain by a revolution; but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom we hate and fear, that the contrary system well deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation.\n\nThe Gothic princes continued to reign over a considerable part of Spain till the beginning of the 8th century, when their empire was overthrown by the Saracens. During this period, they had entirely expelled the Eastern emperors from what they possessed in Spain, and even made considerable conquests in Barbary; but towards the end of the 7th century the Saracens overran all that part of the world with a rapidity which nothing could resist; and having soon possessed themselves of the Gothic dominions in Barbary, they made a descent upon Spain about the year 711 or 712. The king of the Goths at that time was called Roderic, and by his bad conduct had occasioned great disaffection among his subjects. He therefore determined to put all to the issue of a battle, knowing that he could not depend upon the fidelity of his own people if he allowed the enemy time to tamper with them. The two armies met in a plain near Xeres in Andalusia. The Goths began the attack with great fury; but though they fought like men in despair, they were at last defeated with excessive slaughter, and their king himself was supposed to have perished in the battle, being never more heard of.\n\nBy this battle the Moors in a short time rendered themselves masters of almost all Spain. The poor remains of the Goths were obliged to retire into the mountainous parts of Asturias, Burgos, and Bilbao; Spain, the inhabitants of Aragon, Catalonia, and Navarre, though they might have made a considerable stand against the enemy, chose for the most part to retire into France. In 718, however, the power of the Goths began again to revive under Don Pelagio or Pelayo, a prince of the royal blood, who headed those that had retired to the mountains after the fatal battle of Xeres. The place where he first laid the foundation of his government was in the Asturias, in the province of Liebana, about nine leagues in length and four in breadth. This is the most inland part of the country, full of mountains enormously high, and so much fortified by nature, that its inhabitants are capable of resisting almost any number of invaders. Alakor the Saracen governor was no sooner informed of this revival of the Gothic kingdom, than he sent a powerful army, under the command of one Alchaman, to crush Don Pelagio before he had time to establish his power. The king, though his forces were sufficiently numerous (every one of his subjects arrived at man's estate being a soldier), did not think proper to venture a general engagement in the open field; but taking post with part of them in a cavern in a very high mountain, he concealed the rest among precipices, giving orders to them to fall upon the enemy as soon as they should perceive him attacked by them. These orders were punctually executed, though indeed Don Pelagio himself had repulsed his enemies, but not without a miracle, as the Spanish historians pretend. The slaughter was dreadful; for the troops who lay in ambush, joining the rest, and rolling down huge stones from the mountains upon the Moors (the name by which the Saracens were known in Spain), no fewer than 124,000 of these unhappy people perished in one day. The remainder fled till they were stopped by a river, and beginning to coast it, part of a mountain suddenly fell down, stopped up the channel of the river, and either crushed or drowned, by the sudden rising of the water, almost every one of that vast army.\n\nThe Moors were not so much disheartened by this disaster, but that they made a second attempt against army cut in Don Pelagio. Their success was as bad as ever, the greatest part of their army being cut in pieces or taken; in consequence of which, they lost all the Asturias, and never dared to enter the limits with Pelagio afterwards. Indeed, their bad success had in a great measure taken from them the desire of conquering a country where little or nothing was to be gained; and therefore they rather directed their force against France, where they hoped for more plunder. Into this country they poured in prodigious multitudes; but were utterly defeated, in 732, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARLES_MARTEL\">Charles Martel</a>, with the loss of 300,000 men, as the historians of those times pretend.\n\nThe subsequent history of Spain is rendered so confused by the numerous kingdoms that were established either by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> or the Moors, that some chronological guide is necessary to make it intelligible.

In 745 Don Alfonso the Catholic, son-in-law to Pelagio, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with his brother Froila, passed the mountains, and fell upon the northern part of Galicia; and meeting with little resistance, he recovered almost the whole of that province in a single campaign. Next year he invaded the plains of Leon and Cadile; and before the Moors could assemble any force to oppose him, he reduced Astorgas, Leon, Saldagna, Montes de Oca, Amaya, Alava, and all the country at the foot of the mountains. The year following he pushed his conquests as far as the borders of Portugal, and the next campaign ravaged the country as far as Castile. Being sensible, however, that he was yet unable to defend the flat country which he had conquered, he laid the whole of it waste, obliged the Christians to retire to the mountains, and carried off all the Moors for slaves. Thus secured by a desert frontier, he met with no interruption for some years; during which time, as his kingdom advanced in strength, he allowed his subjects gradually to occupy part of the flat country, and to rebuild Leon and Astorgas, which he had demolished. He died in 758, and was succeeded by his son Don Froila. In his time Abdoulrahman, the khalif's vice-The Saracens in Spain, threw off the yoke, and rendered himself independent, fixing the seat of his government at Cordova. Thus the intestine divisions among the Moors of the kingdom were composed; yet their success seems to have been but little better than before; for, soon after, Froila encountered the Moors with such success, that 14,000 of them were killed on the spot, and their general taken prisoner. Soon after he built the city of Oviedo, which he made\nthe capital of his dominions, in order to be in a better condition to defend the flat country, which he now determined to people.\n\nIn the year 850 the power of the Saracens received another blow by the rise of the kingdom of Navarre. This kingdom, we are told, took its origin from an accidental meeting of gentlemen, to the number of 600, at the tomb of an hermit named John, who had died among the Pyrenees. At this place, where they had met on account of the supposed sanctity of the deceased, they took occasion to confer on the cruelty of the Moors, the miseries to which the country was exposed, and the glory that would result from throwing off their yoke; which, they supposed, might easily be done, by reason of the strength of their country. On mature deliberation, the project was approved; one Don Garcias Ximenes was appointed king, as being of illustrious birth, and looked upon as a person of great abilities. He recovered Ainfia, one of the principal towns of the country, out of the hands of the infidels, and his successor Don Garcias Inigas extended his territories as far as Biscay; however, the Moors still possessed Portugal, Murcia, Andalusia, Valencia, Granada, Tortosa, with the interior part of the country as far as the mountains of Castile and Zaragoza. Their internal dissensions, which revived after the death of Abdoulrahman, contributed greatly to reduce the power of the infidels in general. In 778, Charles the Great being invited by some discontented Moorish governors, entered Spain with two great armies; one passing through Catalonia, and the other through Navarre, where he pushed his conquests as far as the Ebro. On his return he was attacked and defeated by the Moors; though this did not hinder him from keeping possession of all those places he had already reduced. At this time he seems to have been master of Navarre; however, in 831 Count Azner, revolting from Pepin for the emperor Louis, asserted the independency of Navarre; but the sovereigns did not assume the title of kings till the time of Don Garcias, who began to reign in 857.\n\nIn the mean time, the kingdom founded by Don Pelagio, now called the kingdom of Leon and Oviedo, continued to increase rapidly in strength, and many advantages were gained over the Moors, who having two enemies to contend with, lost ground every day. In 921, however, they gained a great victory over the united forces of Navarre and Leon, by which the whole force of the Christians in Spain must have been entirely broken, had not the victors conducted their affairs so wretchedly, that they suffered themselves to be almost entirely cut in pieces by the remains of the Christian army. In short, the Christians became at length so terrible to the Moors, that it is probable they could not long have kept their footing in Spain, had not a great general, named Mohammed Ebn Amir Almanzor, appeared, in 979, to support their sinking cause. This man was vizir to the king of Cordova, and being exceedingly provoked against the Christians on account of what his countrymen had suffered from them, made war with the most implacable fury. He took the city of Leon, murdered the inhabitants, and reduced the houles to ashes. Barcelona shared the same fate; Castile was reduced to a desert; Galicia and Portugal ravaged; and he is said to have overcome the Christians in fifty different engagements. At last, having taken and demolished the city of Compostella, and carried off Spain in triumph the gates of the church of St James, a flux happened to break out among his troops, which the perfidious Christians supposed to be a divine judgment on account of his sacrilege. Taking it for granted, therefore, that the Moors were now entirely destitute of all heavenly aid, they fell upon them with such fury in the next engagement, that all the valour and conduct of Almanzor could not prevent a defeat. He is defeated, and overcome with shame and despair at this misfortune, flares himself deprived of his followers to shift for themselves, while he fell to himself retired to Medina Coeli, and put an end to his death by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> in the year 998.\n\nDuring this period a new Christian principality appeared in Spain, namely that of Castile, which is now divided into the Old and New Castile. The Old Castile was recovered long before that called the New. It was separated from the kingdom of Leon on one side by some little rivers; on the other, it was bounded by the Asturias, Biscay, and the province of Rioja. On the fourth it had the mountains of Segovia and Avila; thus lying in the middle between the Christian kingdom of Leon and Oviedo, and the Moorish kingdom of Cordova. Hence this district soon became an object of contention between the kings of Leon and those of Cordova; and as the former were generally victorious, some of the principal Castilian nobility retained their independence under the protection of the Christian kings, even when the power of the Moors was at its greatest height. In 884 we first hear of Don Rodrigo, assuming the title of count of Castile; though it does not appear that either his territory or title were given him by the king of Leon. Nevertheless, this monarch having taken upon him to punish some of the Castilian lords as rebels, the inhabitants made a formal renunciation of their allegiance, and set up a new kind of government. The supreme power was now vested in two persons of quality styled judges; however, this method did not long continue to give satisfaction, and the sovereignty was once more vested in a single person. By degrees Castile fell entirely under the power of the kings of Leon and Oviedo; and, in 1037, Don Sancho bestowed it on his eldest son Don Ferdinand, with the title of king; and thus the territories of Castile were first firmly united to those of Leon and Oviedo, and the sovereigns were thenceforth styled kings of Leon and Castile.\n\nBesides all these, another Christian kingdom was set up in Spain about the beginning of the 11th century. This was the kingdom of Aragon. The inhabitants were very brave, and lovers of liberty, so that it is probable they had in some degree maintained their independence, even when the power of the Moors was greatest. The history of Aragon, however, during its infancy, is much less known than that of any of the others hitherto mentioned. We are only assured, that about the year 1035, Don Sancho, farnamed the Great, king of Navarre, erected Aragon into a kingdom in favour of his son Don Ramiro, and afterwards it became very powerful. At this time, then, we may imagine the continent of Spain divided into two unequal parts by a straight line drawn from east to west, from the coasts of Valencia to a little below the mouth of the Douro. The country north of this belonged to the Christians, who, as yet, had the smallest and least valuable\nSpain: able share, and all the rest to the Moors. In point of wealth and real power, both by land and sea, the Moors were much superior; but their continual dissensions greatly weakened them, and every day facilitated the progress of the Christians. Indeed, had either of the parties been united, the other must soon have yielded; for though the Christians did not make war upon each other constantly as the Moors did, their mutual feuds were yet sufficient to have ruined them, had their adversaries made the proper use of the advantages thus afforded them. But among the Moors almost every city was a kingdom; and as these petty sovereignties supported one another very indifferently, they fell a prey one after another to their enemies. In 1080, the king of Toledo was engaged in a war with the king of Seville, another Moorish potentate; which being observed by Alphonso king of Castile, he also invaded his territories; and in four years made himself master of the city of Toledo, with all the places of importance in its neighbourhood; from thenceforth making Toledo the capital of his dominions. In a short time the whole province of New Castile submitted; and Madrid, the present capital of Spain, fell into the hands of the Christians, being at that time but a small place.\n\nThe Moors were so much alarmed at these conquests, that they not only entered into a general confederacy against the Christians, but invited to their assistance Mahomet Ben Jofeph the sovereign of Barbary. He accordingly came, attended by an incredible multitude; but was utterly defeated by the Christians in the defiles of the Black Mountain, or Sierra Morena, on the borders of Andalusia. This victory happened on the 16th of July 1212, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNIVERSARY\">anniversary</a> is still celebrated at Toledo. This victory was not improved; the Christian army immediately dispersed themselves, while the Moors of Andalusia were strengthened by the remains of the African army; yet, instead of being taught, by their past misfortunes, to unite among themselves, their dissensions became worse than ever, and the conquests of the Christians became daily more rapid. In 1236, Don Ferdinand of Castile and Leon took the celebrated city of Cordova, the residence of the first Moorish kings; at the same time that James I. of Aragon dispossessed them of the island of Majorca, and drove them out of Valencia. Two years after, Ferdinand made himself master of Murcia, and took the city of Seville; and in 1233 Ferdinand IV. reduced Gibraltar.\n\nIn the time of Edward III. we find England, for the first time, interfering in the affairs of Spain, on the following occasion. In the year 1284 the kingdom of Navarre had been united to that of France by the marriage of Donna Joanna queen of Navarre with Philip the Fair of France. In 1328, however, the kingdoms were again separated, though the sovereigns of Navarre were still related to those of France. In 1350, Charles, surnamed the Wicked, ascended the throne of Navarre, and married the daughter of John king of France. Notwithstanding this alliance, and that he himself was related to the royal family of France, he secretly entered into a negociation with England against the French monarch, and even drew into his schemes the dauphin Charles, afterwards surnamed the Wise. The young prince, however, was soon after made fully sensible of the danger and folly of the connection into which he had entered; and, by way of atonement, promised to sacrifice his associates. Accordingly he invited the king of Navarre, and some of the principal nobility of the same party, to a feast at Rouen, where he betrayed them to his father. The most obnoxious were executed, and the king of Navarre was thrown into prison. In this extremity, the party of the king of Navarre had recourse to England. The prince of Wales, surnamed the Black Prince, invaded France, defeated King John at Poitiers, and took him prisoner; which unfortunate event produced the most violent disturbances in that kingdom. The dauphin, now about 19 years of age, naturally assumed the royal power during his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>; but possessed neither experience nor authority sufficient to remedy the prevailing evils. In order to obtain supplies, he assembled the states of the kingdom; but that assembly, instead of supporting his administration, laid hold of the present opportunity to demand limitations of the prince's power, the punishment of past malversations, and the liberty of the king of Navarre. Marcel, provost of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of Paris, and first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of that city, put himself at the head of the unruly populace, and pushed them to commit the most criminal outrages against the royal authority. They detained the dauphin in a kind of captivity, murdered in his presence Robert de Clermont and John de Conflans, marshals of France; threatened all the other ministers with the like fate; and when Charles, who had been obliged to temporize and dissemble, made his escape from their hands, they levied war against him, and openly rebelled. The other cities of the kingdom, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the capital, shook off the dauphin's authority, took the government into their own hands, and spread the contagion into every province.\n\nAmidst these disorders, the king of Navarre made his escape from prison, and presented a dangerous leader and head to the furious malecontents. He revived his pretensions to the crown of France; but in all his operations he manifested more like a leader of banditti than one who aspired to be the head of a regular government, and who was engaged by his station to endeavour the re-establishment of order in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. All the French, therefore, who wished to restore peace to their country, turned their eyes towards the dauphin; who, though not remarkable for his military talents, daily gained by his prudence and vigilance the ascendancy over his enemies. Marcel, the sedulous provost of Paris, was slain in attempting to deliver that city to the king of Navarre. The capital immediately returned to its duty; the most considerable bodies of the mutinous peasants were dispersed or put to the sword; some bands of military robbers underwent the same fate; and France began once more to assume the appearance of civil government.\n\nJohn was succeeded in the throne of France by his son Charles V., a prince educated in the school of adversity, and well qualified, by his prudence and experience, to repair the losses which the kingdom had sustained from the errors of his predecessors. Contrary to the practice of all the great princes of those times, who held nothing in estimation but military courage, he seems to have laid it down as a maxim, never to appear at the head of his armies; and he was the first European monarch that showed the advantage of policy and foresight over a rash and precipitate valour.\n\nBefore Charles could think of counterbalancing fo\nSpain, great a power as England, it was necessary for him to remedy the many disorders to which his own kingdom was exposed. He accordingly turned his arms against the king of Navarre, the great disturber of France due to submit to ring that age; and he defeated that prince, and reduced him to terms, by the valour and conduct of Bertrand du Gueflin, one of the most accomplished captains of those times, whom Charles had the discernment to choose as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of his victories. He also settled the affairs of Brittany, by acknowledging the title of Montfort, and receiving homage for his dominions. But much was yet to be done. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> of the peace of Bretigny, the many military adventurers who had followed the fortunes of Edward, being dispersed into the several provinces, and possessed of strong holds, refused to lay down their arms, or relinquish a course of life to which they were now accustomed, and by which alone they could earn a subsistence.\n\nThey allocated themselves with the banditti, who were already inured to the habits of rapine and violence; and, under the name of companies and companions, became a terror to all the peaceable inhabitants. Some English and Gascon gentlemen of character were not ashamed to take the command of these ruffians, whose number amounted to near 40,000, and who bore the appearance of regular armies rather than bands of robbers. As Charles was not able by power to redress so enormous a grievance, he was led by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, as well as by the turn of his character, to correct it by policy; to discover some method of discharging into foreign countries this dangerous and intestine evil; and an occasion now offered.\n\nAlfonso XI, king of Castile, who took the city of Algeciras from the Moors, after a famous siege of two years, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> was said first to have been used by the besieged, had been succeeded by his son Pedro I, surnamed the Cruel; a prince equally perfidious, debauched, and bloody. He began his reign with the murder of his father's ministers, Leonora de Guiflin; his nobles fell every day victims of his severity; he put to death his cousin and one of his natural brothers, from groundless jealousy; and he caused his queen Blanche de Bourbon, of the blood of France, to be thrown into prison, and afterwards poisoned, that he might enjoy in quiet the embraces of Mary de Padella, with whom he was violently enamoured.\n\nHenry count of Trastamara, the king's natural brother, alarmed at the fate of his family, and dreading his own, took arms against the tyrant; but having failed in the attempt, he fled to France, where he found the minds of men much inflamed against Pedro, on account of the murder of the French prince's. He asked permission of Charles to enlist the companies in his service, and to lead them into Castile against his brother. The French king, charmed with the project, employed du Guiflin in negotiating with the leaders of these banditti. The treaty was soon concluded; and du Guiflin having completed his levies, led the army first to Avignon, where the pope then resided, and demanded, sword in hand, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a> for his ruffian followers, who had been excommunicated, and the sum of 200,000 livres for their subsistence. The first was readily promised him, but some difficulty being made with regard to the second, du Guiflin replied, \"My fellows, I believe, may make a shift to do without your absolution, but the money is absolutely necessary.\" This holiness then extorted from the inhabitants of the city and its neighbourhood the sum of 100,000 livres, and offered it to du Guiflin. \"It is not my purpose (cried that generous warrior) to oppress the innocent people. The pope and his cardinals can spare me double the sum from their own pockets. I therefore insist, that this money be restored to the owners; and if I hear they are defrauded of it, I will myself return from the other side of the Pyrenees, and oblige you to make them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a>.\" The pope found the necessity of submitting, and paid from his own treasury the sum demanded.\n\nA body of experienced and hardy soldiers, conducted by a able general, easily prevailed over the king of Castile, whose subjects were ready to join the enemy fitted against their oppressor. Pedro fled from his dominions, the Black Prince took shelter in Guinne, and craved the protection of the prince of Wales, whom his father had invested with the sovereignty of the ceded provinces, under the title of the principality of Aquitaine. The prince promised his assistance to the dethroned monarch; and having obtained his father's consent, he levied an army, and set out on his enterprise.\n\nThe first loss which Henry of Trastamara suffered from the interposition of the prince of Wales, was the recalling of the companies from his service; and so much reverence did they pay to the name of Edward, that great numbers of them immediately withdrew from Spain, and enlisted under his standard. Henry, however, beloved by his new subjects, and supported by the king of Arragon, was able to meet the enemy with an army of 100,000 men, three times the number of those commanded by the Black Prince; yet du Guiflin, and all his experienced officers, advised him to delay a decisive action; so high was their opinion of the valour and conduct of the English hero! But Henry, trusting to his numbers, ventured to give Edward battle on the banks of the Ebro, between Najara and Navarette; where the French and Spaniards were defeated, with upwards of 20,000 men, and du Guiflin and others, and other officers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> taken prisoners. All Castile surrendered to the victor; Pedro was restored to the throne, and Edward returned to Guinne with his usual glory; having not only overcome the greatest general of his age, but restrained the most blood-thirsty tyrant from executing vengeance on his prisoners.\n\nThis gallant warrior had soon reason to repent of his connection with a man like Pedro, lost to all sense of virtue and honour. The ungrateful monster refused the stipulated pay to the English forces. Edward abandoned him; he treated his subjects with the utmost barbarity; their animosity was roused against him; and du Guiflin having obtained his ransom, returned to Castile with the count of Trastamara, and some forces levied anew in France. They were joined by the Spanish malcontents; and having no longer the Black Prince to encounter, they gained a complete victory over Pedro; again in the neighbourhood of Toledo. The tyrant now took refuge in a castle, where he was soon after beheld by the visitors, and taken prisoner in endeavouring to make death. His escape. He was conducted to his brother Henry; against whom he is said to have rushed in a transport of rage, disarmed as he was. Henry slew him with his own\nSpain, own hand, in resentment of his cruelties; and, though a bastard, was placed on the throne of Castile, which he transmitted to his posterity.\n\nThere is little doubt that the character of Pedro has been greatly misrepresented, and that what is considered by most historians as tyranny and wanton cruelty, was only an inflexible regard to justice, necessary perhaps, in those days of anarchy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a>. Perhaps that unfortunate monarch owes to the hatred of those he meant to reduce to order, much of the obloquy which has been so plentifully bestowed upon him by historians, who have painted him to us as a tyrant too bloody, too wicked, as almost to exceed the bounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>. In Andalusia, where he fixed his residence and seemed most to delight, his memory is not held in the same abhorrence. The Spanish writers speak of him very differently; and instead of his usual appellation of Pedro el cruel, distinguish him by that of el justiciero. It is certain that his bastard-brother and murderer, Henry of Trast\u00e1mara, was guilty of crimes fully as atrocious as any of those imputed to Don Pedro; but as he destroyed him, his family, and adherents, the friends of the new spurious race of monarchs were left at full liberty to blacken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the adverse party, without the fear of being called to an account for calumny, or even contradicted. Truth is now out of our reach; and for want of proper proofs to the contrary, we must fit down contented with what history has left us; and allow Don Pedro to have been one of the most inhuman butchers that ever disgraced a throne.\n\nAfter the death of Pedro the Cruel, nothing remarkable happened in Spain for almost a whole century; but the debaucheries of Henry IV. of Castile routed the resentment of his nobles, and produced a most singular insurrection, which led to the aggrandizement of the Spanish monarchy.\n\nThis prince, nicknamed the Impotent, though continually surrounded with women, began his unhappy reign in 1450. He was totally enervated by his pleasures; and everything in his court conspired to set the Castilians an example of the most abject flattery and most abandoned licentiousness. The queen, a daughter of Portugal, lived as openly with her parasites and her gallants as the king did with his minions and his mistresses. Pleasure was the only object, and effeminacy the only recommendation to favour: the affairs of the state went every day into disorder; till the nobility, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Toledo at their head, combining against the weak and flagitious administration of Henry, arrogated to themselves, as one of the privileges of their order, the right of trying and passing sentence on their sovereign, which they executed in a manner unprecedented in history.\n\nAll the malecontent nobility were summoned to meet at Avila; a spacious theatre was erected in a plain without the walls of the town: an image, representing the king, was seated on a throne, clad in royal robes, with a crown on its head, a sceptre in its hand, and the sword of justice by its side. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> against Henry was read, and the sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> pronounced, in presence of a numerous assembly. At the close of the first article of the charge, the archbishop of Toledo advanced, and tore the crown from the head of the image; at the close of the second, the Conde de Placentia snatched the sword of justice from its side; at the close of the third, the Conde de Benavente wrested the sceptre from its hand; and at the close of the last, Don Diego Lopez de Stuniga tumbled it headlong from the throne. At the same instant, Don Alphonso, Henry's brother, a boy of about twelve years of age, was proclaimed king of Castile and Leon in his stead.\n\nThis extraordinary proceeding was followed by a civil war, which did not cease till some time after the death of the young prince, on whom the nobles had bestowed the kingdom. The archbishop and his party then continued to carry on war in the name of Isabella the king's sister, to whom they gave the title of Infanta; and Henry could not extricate himself out of these troubles, nor remain quiet upon his throne till he had signed one of the most humiliating treaties ever extorted from a sovereign; he acknowledged his sister Isabel, sitra in la only lawful heiress of his kingdom, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> she be to the rights of his reputed daughter Joan, whom the malecontents affirmed to be the offspring of an adulterous commerce between the queen and Don la Cueva.\n\nThe grand object of the malecontent party now was the marriage of the princess Isabella, upon which, it was evident, the security of the crown and the happiness of the people must in a great measure depend. The alliance was sought by several princes: the king of Portugal offered her his hand; the king of France demanded her for his brother, and the king of Aragon for his son Ferdinand. The malecontents very wisely preferred the Aragonian prince, and Isabella prudently and wisely made the same choice: articles were drawn up; and they were privately married by the archbishop of Toledo.\n\nHenry was enraged at this alliance, which he foresaw would utterly ruin his authority, by furnishing his rebellious subjects with the support of a powerful neighbouring prince. He disdained his sister, and established the rights of his daughter. A furious civil war desolated the kingdom. The names of Joan and Isabella resounded from every quarter, and were everywhere the summons to arms. But peace was at length brought about. Henry was reconciled to his sister and Ferdinand; though it does not appear that he ever renewed Isabella's right to the succession: for he affirmed in his last moments, that he believed Joan to be his own daughter. The queen swore to the same effect; and Henry left a testamentary deed, transmitting the crown to this princess, who was proclaimed queen of Castile at Union of Placentia. But the superior fortune and superior arms of Ferdinand and Isabella prevailed: the king of Portugal was obliged to abandon his niece and intended ragon and bride, after many ineffectual struggles, and several years' war. Joan retired into a convent; and the death of Castile, Ferdinand's father, which happened about this time, added the kingdoms of Aragon and Sicily to those of Leon and Castile.\n\nFerdinand and Isabella were persons of great prudence, and, as sovereigns, highly worthy of imitation; but they do not seem to have merited all the praise and honour bestowed upon them by the Spanish historians. They did not live like man and wife, having all things in common under the direction of the husband; but like two princes in close alliance; they neither loved nor hated each other; were seldom in company together; had each a separate council; and were frequently jealous of one another in the administration. But they...\nwere inseparably united in their common interests; always acting upon the same principles, and forwarding the same ends. Their first object was the regulation of their government, which the civil wars had thrown into the greatest disorder. Rape, outrage, and murder, were become so common, as not only to interrupt commerce, but in a great measure to suspend all intercourse between one place and another. These evils the joint sovereigns suppressed by their wise policy, at the same time that they extended the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>.\n\nAbout the middle of the 13th century, the cities in the kingdom of Aragon, and after their example those in Castile, had formed themselves into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, distinguished by the name of the Holy Brotherhood. They exacted a certain contribution from each of the associated towns; they levied a considerable body of troops, in order to protect travellers and pursue criminals; and they appointed judges, who opened courts in various parts of the kingdom. Whoever was guilty of murder, robbery, or any act that violated the public peace, and was seized by the troops of the Brotherhood, was carried before their judges; who, without paying any regard to the exclusive jurisdiction which the lord of the place might claim, who was generally the author or abettor of the injustice, tried, and condemned the criminals. The nobles often murmured against the salutary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>; they complained of it as an encroachment on one of their most valuable privileges, and endeavoured to get it abolished. But Ferdinand and Isabella, sensible of the beneficial effects of the Brotherhood, not only in regard to the police of their kingdoms, but in its tendency to abridge, and by degrees annihilate, the territorial jurisdiction of the nobility, countenanced the institution upon every occasion, and supported it with the whole force of royal authority; by which means the prompt and impartial administration of justice was restored, and with it tranquillity and order returned.\n\nBut at the same time that their Catholic majesties (for such was the title they now bore) were giving vigour to their civil government, and securing their subjects from violence and oppression, an intemperate zeal led them to establish an ecclesiastical tribunal, equally contrary to the natural rights of humanity and the mild spirit of the gospel. This was the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>; which decides upon the honour, fortune, and even the life, of the unhappy wretch who happens to fall under the suspicion of heresy, or a contempt of any thing prescribed by the church, without his knowing, being confronted with his accusers, or permitted either defence or appeal. Six thousand persons were burnt by order of this sanguinary tribunal within four years after the appointment of Torquemada, the first inquisitor-general; and upwards of 100,000 felt its fury. The same furious and blinded zeal which led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a> of Spain, led also to its aggrandizement.\n\nThe kingdom of Granada now alone remained of all the Mahometan possessions in Spain. Princes equally zealous and ambitious were naturally disposed to turn their eyes to that fertile territory, and to think of increasing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> dominions, by expelling the enemies of Christianity, and extending its doctrines. Everything conspired to favour their project: the Moorish kingdom was a prey to civil wars; when Ferdinand, having obtained the bull of Sixtus IV. authorizing a crusade, put himself at the head of his troops, and entered Granada. He continued the war with rapid success: Isabella attended him in several expeditions; and they were both in great danger at the siege of Malaga; an important city, which was defended with great courage, and taken in 1487. Baza was reduced in 1489, after the loss of 20,000 men. Gaudix and Almeria were delivered up to them by the Moorish king Alzagal, who had first deposed his brother Alboacel, and afterwards been chased from his capital by his nephew Abdali. That prince engaged in the service of Ferdinand and Isabella; who, after reducing every other place of eminence, undertook the siege of Granada. Abdali made a gallant defence; but all communication with the country being cut off, and all hopes of relief at an end, he capitulated, after a siege of eight months, on condition that he should enjoy the revenue of certain places in the fertile mountains of Alpujarras; that the inhabitants should retain the undisturbed possession of their houses, goods, and inheritances; the use of their laws, and the free exercise of their religion (a).\n\nThus ended the empire of the Arabs in Spain, after it had continued about 800 years. They introduced the arts and sciences into Europe at a time when it was lost in darkness; they possessed many of the luxuries of life, when they were not even known among the neighbouring nations; and they seem to have given birth to that romantic gallantry which so eminently prevailed in the ages of chivalry, and which, blending itself with the veneration of the northern nations for the softer sex, still particularly distinguishes ancient from modern manners. But the Moors, notwithstanding these advantages, and the eulogies bestowed upon them by some writers, appear always to have been destitute of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> qualities of a polished people, humanity, generosity, and mutual sympathy.\n\nThe overthrow of the last Moorish kingdom was soon followed by the expulsion of the Saracens from Spain. This expulsion did not entirely take place till the 17th century. Vast numbers of the Moors, indeed, oppressed by their conquerors, abandoned a country where they could not reside with comfort and with freedom. From the reign of Ferdinand of Castile, to that of Philip III. of Spain, more than 3,000,000 of those people quitted Spain, and carried with them, not only a great part of their acquired wealth, but that industry and love of labour which are the foundation of national prosperity.\n\nThe state of Spain has never been so flourishing at prosperous any period of its civilization, as during the period when state of it was chiefly possessed by the Moors. The first Sara-Spain unclean invaders, and the twenty successeive lieutenants of the caliphs of Damascus, were attended by a numerous train of civil and military followers, who preferred a distant\n\n(B) The particulars of the conquest of Granada are involved in much obscurity. If we were to credit the narrative of Giles Perez, as related by Mr Swinburne, the circumstances which led to that conquest were of a most romantic nature. See Swinburne's Travels, Letter xxi.\nSpain\n\ndistant fortune to narrow circumstances at home; the private and public interest was promoted by the establishment of faithful colonies, and the cities of Spain were proud to commemorate the tribe or the country of their eastern progenitors. Ten years after the conquest, a map of the province was presented to the caliph, shewing the seas, the rivers, and the harbours, the inhabitants and cities, the climate, the soil, and the mineral productions of the earth. In the space of two centuries, the gifts of nature were improved by agriculture, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and the commerce of an industrious people; though the effects of their diligence have been magnified by the idleness of their fancy. The first of the Omniades who reigned in Spain solicited the support of the Christians; and in his edict of peace and protection, he contents himself with a modest imposition of 10,000 ounces of gold, 10,000 pounds of silver, 10,000 horses, as many mules, 10,000 curriaces, with an equal number of helmets and lances. The most powerful of his successors derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of 12,045,000 dinars or pieces of gold, about 6,000,000l. of sterling money; a sum which, in the 10th century, must probably surpassed the united revenues of the Christian monarchs. His royal seat of Cordova contained 600 mosques, 900 baths, and 200,000 houses; he gave laws to 80 cities of the first, to 300 of the second and third order; and the fertile banks of the Guadalquivir were adorned with 12,000 villages and hamlets. The Arabs might exaggerate the truth; but they created and they describe the most prosperous era of the riches, the cultivation, and the populousness of Spain (c).\n\nThe conquest of Granada was followed by the expulsion, or rather the pillage and banishment, of the Jews, who had engrossed all the wealth and commerce of Spain. The inquisition exhausted its rage against these unhappy people, many of whom pretended to embrace Christianity, in order to preserve their property. About the same time their Catholic majesties concluded an alliance with the emperor Maximilian, and a treaty of marriage of America for their daughter Joan with his son Philip, archduke of Austria and sovereign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>. About this time also the contract was concluded with Christopher Columbus for the discovery of new countries; and the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne were agreed to be restored by Charles VIII. of France, before his expedition into Italy. The discovery of America was soon followed by extensive conquests in that quarter, as is related under the articles Mexico, Peru, Chili, &c., which tended to raise the Spanish monarchy above any other in Europe.\n\nOn the death of Isabella, which happened in 1506, Philip archduke of Austria came to Castile in order to Charles V. take possession of that kingdom as heir to his mother-in-law; but he dying in a short time after, his son Charles V. afterwards emperor of Germany, became heir to the crown of Spain. His father at his death left the king of France governor to the young prince, and Ferdinand at his death left Cardinal Ximenes sole regent of Castile, till the arrival of his grandson. This man, whose character is no less singular than illustrious, who united the abilities of a great statesman with the abject devotion of a superstitious monk, and the magnificence of a prime minister with the severity of a mendicant, maintained order and tranquillity in Spain, notwithstanding the discontentments of a turbulent and high-spirited nobility. When they disputed his right to the regency, he coolly showed them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">testament</a> of Ferdinand, and the ratification of that deed by Charles; but these not satisfying them, and argument proving ineffectual, he led them infensibly towards a balcony, whence they had a view of a large body of troops under arms, and\n\n(c) Abdoulrahman III. monarch of Cordova, surpassed all his predecessors in splendour, riches, and expense; and his subjects vied with each other in profusion and magnificence. Some idea may be entertained of the opulence and grandeur of the Moors of Cordova in the 10th century, by perusing the following enumeration of the presents made to Abdoulrahman by Abumelik his grand vizir, on his appointment to that office. We are told that the minister caused to be brought before the throne, and laid at the feet of his master,\n\n- 400 lbs. of virgin gold.\n- Ingots of silver to the value of 420,000 sequins.\n- 400 lbs. of lignum aloes, one piece weighing 140 lb.\n- 500 oz. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBERGRIS\">ambergris</a>.\n- 300 oz. of camphor.\n- 30 pieces of gold tifia, so rich that none but the caliph could wear it.\n- 10 suits of Khorafan fables.\n- 100 suits of fur of a less valuable sort.\n- 48 sets of gold and silk long trappings for horses.\n- 4000 lbs. of silk.\n- 30 Persian carpets.\n- 800 iron coats-of-mail for war horses.\n- 1000 shields.\n- 100,000 arrows.\n- 15 led horses of Arabia, as richly caparisoned as those on which the caliph was wont to ride.\n- 100 horses of an inferior price.\n- 20 mules with all their accoutrements.\n- 40 young men, and 20 girls of exquisite beauty, and most sumptuously appalled. This display of riches was accompanied with a most flattering poem, composed by the minister in praise of his sovereign, who in return for his homage, affixed him a pension of 100,000 pieces of gold, about 50,000l. sterling.\n\nVol. XIX, Part II.\nSpain.\n\nand a formidable train of artillery. \"Behold (said the cardinal) the powers which I have received from his Catholic majesty: by these I govern Castile; and will govern it, till the king, your master and mine, shall come to take possession of his kingdom.\" A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> so bold and determined silenced all opposition; and Ximenes maintained his authority till the arrival of Charles in 1517.\n\nThe young king was received with universal acclamations of joy; but Ximenes found little cause to rejoice. He was seized with a violent disorder, supposed to be the effect of poison; and when he recovered, Charles, prejudiced against him by the Spanish grandees and his Flemish courtiers, flouted his advice, and allowed him every day to sink into neglect. The cardinal did not bear this treatment with his usual fortitude of spirit. He expected a more grateful return from a prince to whom he delivered a kingdom more flourishing than it had been in any former age, and authority more extensive and better established than the most illustrious of his ancestors had ever possessed. Conscious of his own integrity and merit, he could not therefore refrain from giving vent, at times, to indignation and complaint. He lamented the fate of his country, and foretold the calamities to which it would be exposed from the influence, the rapacity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of strangers. But in the mean time he received a letter from the king, dismissing him from his councils, under pretence of eating his age of that burden which he had so long and so ably sustained. This letter proved fatal to the minister; for he expired in a few hours after reading it.\n\nWhile Charles was taking possession of the throne of Spain, in consequence of the death of one grandfather, another was endeavouring to obtain for him the imperial crown. With this view Maximilian assembled a diet at Augsburg, where he cultivated the favour of the electors by many acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, in order to engage them to choose that young prince as his successor. But Maximilian himself never having been crowned by the pope, a ceremony deemed essential in that age, as well as in the preceding, he was considered only as king of the Romans, or emperor elect; and no example occurring in history of any person being chosen successor to a king of the Romans, the Germans, always tenacious of their forms, obstinately refused to confer upon Charles a dignity for which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> knew no name.\n\nBut though Maximilian could not prevail upon the German electors to choose his grandson of Spain king of the Romans, he had disposed their minds in favour of that prince; and other circumstances, on the death of the emperor, confirmed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXALTATION\">exaltation</a> of Charles. The imperial crown had so long continued in the Austrian line, that it began to be considered as hereditary in that family; and Germany, torn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> disputes, stood in need of a powerful emperor, not only to preserve its own internal tranquillity, but also to protect it against the victorious arms of the Turks, who under Selim I. threatened the liberties of Europe. This fierce and rapid conqueror had already subdued the Mamelukes, and made himself master of Egypt and Syria. The power of Charles appeared necessary to oppose that of Selim. The extensive dominions of the house of Austria, which gave him an interest in the preservation of Germany; the rich sovereignty of the Netherlands and Franche Comt\u00e9; the entire possession of the great and warlike kingdom of Spain, together with that of Naples and Sicily, all united to hold him up to the first dignity among Christian princes; and the new world seemed only to be called into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> that its treasures might enable him to defend Christendom against the infidels. Such was the language of his partisans.\n\nFrancis I. however, no sooner received intelligence of Francis I., the death of Maximilian, than he declared himself a candidate for the empire; and with no less confidence of the same success than Charles. He trusted to his superior years and experience; his great reputation in arms; and it was farther urged in his favour, that the impetuosity of the French cavalry, added to the firmness of the German infantry, would prove irresistible, and not only be sufficient, under a warlike emperor, to set limits to the ambition of Selim, but to break entirely the Ottoman power, and prevent it from ever becoming dangerous again to Germany.\n\nBoth claims were plausible. The dominions of Francis were less extensive, but more united than those of Charles. His subjects were numerous, active, brave, lovers of glory, and lovers of their king. These were strong arguments in favour of his power, so necessary at this juncture: but he had no natural interest in the Germanic body; and the electors, hearing so much of military force on each side, became more alarmed for their own privileges than the common safety. They determined to reject both candidates, and offered the imperial crown to Frederic, surnamed the Wise, duke of Saxony. But he, undazzled by the splendour of an object courted with so much eagerness, by two mighty monarchs, rejected it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> no less singular than great.\n\n\"In times of tranquillity (said Frederic), we wish for an emperor who has no power to invade our liberties; times of danger demand one who is able to secure our safety. The Turkish armies, led by a warlike and victorious monarch, are now assembling: they are ready to pour into upper Germany with a violence unknown in former ages. New conjunctures call for new expedients. The imperial sceptre must be committed to some hand more powerful than mine or that of any other German prince. We possess neither dominions, nor revenues, nor authority, which enable us to encounter such a formidable enemy. Recourse must be had, in this exigency, to one of the rival monarchs. Each of them can bring into the field forces sufficient for our defence. But as the king of Spain is of German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, as he is a member and prince of the empire by the territories which defend him from his grandfather, and as his dominions stretch along that frontier which lies most exposed to the enemy, his claim, in my opinion, is preferable to that of a stranger to our language, to our blood, and to our country.\" Charles was elected in consequence of this speech in the year 1520.\n\nThe two candidates had hitherto conducted their rivalry with emulation, but without enmity. They had even mingled in their competition many expressions of friendship and regard. Francis in particular declared with his usual vivacity, that his brother Charles and he were fairly and openly suitors to the same mistress: \"The most affluence and fortunate (added he) will win her; and the other must rest contented.\" But the preference was no sooner given to his rival, than Francis discovered\ndiscovered all the passions natural to disappointed ambition. He could not suppress his chagrin and indignation at being balked in his favourite pursuit, and rejected, in the face of all Europe, for a youth yet unknown to fame. The spirit of Charles resented such contempt; and from this jealousy, as much as from opposition of interests, arose that emulation between those two great monarchs which involved them in almost perpetual hostilities, and kept their whole age in constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>.\n\nCharles and Francis had many interfering claims in Italy; and the latter thought himself bound in honour to restore the king of Navarre to his dominions, unjustly seized by the crown of Spain. They immediately began to negotiate; and as Henry VIII. of England was the third prince of the age in power and in dignity, his friendship was eagerly courted by each of the rivals. He was the natural guardian of the liberties of Europe. Sensible of the consequence which his situation gave him, and proud of his pre-eminence, Henry knew it to be his interest to keep the balance even between the contending powers, and to refrain both, by not joining entirely with either; but he was seldom able to reduce his ideas to practice. Vanity and resentment were the great springs of all his undertakings; and his neighbours, by touching these, found an easy way to draw him into their measures, and force him upon many rash and inconsiderate enterprises.\n\nAll the impolitic steps in Henry\u2019s government must not, however, be imputed to himself; many of them were occasioned by the ambition and avarice of his prime minister and favourite Cardinal Wolsey. This man, who, by his talents and accomplishments, had risen from one of the lowest conditions in life to the highest employments both in church and state, enjoyed a greater degree of power and dignity than any English subject ever possessed, and governed the haughty, presumptuous, and untractable spirit of Henry, with absolute authority. Francis was equally well acquainted with the character of Henry and of his minister. He had successfully flattered Wolsey\u2019s pride, by honouring him with particular marks of his confidence, and bestowing upon him the appellations of Father, Tutor, and Governor; and he had obtained the restitution of Tournay, by adding a pension to those respectful titles. He now solicited an interview with the king of England near Calais; in hopes of being able, by familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, to attach him to his friendship and interest, while he gratified the cardinal\u2019s vanity, by affording him an opportunity of displaying his magnificence in the presence of two courts, and of discovering to the two nations his influence over their monarchs. Charles dreaded the effects of this projected interview between two gallant princes, whose hearts were no less susceptible of friendship than their manners were of inspiring it. Finding it impossible, however, to prevent a visit, in which the vanity of all parties was so much concerned, he endeavoured to defeat its purpose, and to pre-occupy the favour of the English monarch, and of his minister, by an act of complaisance still more flattering and more uncommon. Relying wholly upon Henry\u2019s generosity for his safety, he landed at Dover, in his way from Spain to the Low Countries. The king of England, who was on his way to France, charmed with such an instance of confidence, hastened to receive his royal guest; and Charles, during his short stay, had the address not only to give Henry favourable impressions of his character and intentions, but to detach Wolsey entirely from the interest of Francis. The tiara had attracted the eye of that ambitious prelate; and as the emperor knew that the papacy was the sole point of elevation, beyond his present greatness, at which he could aspire, he made him an offer of his interest on the first vacancy.\n\nThe day of Charles\u2019s departure, Henry went over to Calais with his whole court, in order to meet Francis. Their interview was in an open plain between Guines and Ardres; where the two kings and their attendants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> their magnificence with such emulation and profuse expense, as procured it the name of the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Here Henry erected a spacious house of wood and canvas, framed in London, on which, under the figure of an English archer, was the following motto, \u201cHe prevails whom I favour;\u201d alluding to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> situation, as holding in his hands the balance of power among the potentates of Europe. Feasts of chivalry however, parties of gallantry, and such exercises as were in that age reckoned manly or elegant, rather than ferious buffets, occupied the two courts during the time that they continued together, which was 18 days.\n\nAfter taking leave of this scene of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a>, the king of England paid a visit to the emperor and Margaret of Savoy at Gravelines, and engaged them to go along with him to Calais; where the artful and politic Charles completed the impression which he had begun to make on Henry and his favourite, and effaced all the friendship to which the frank and generous nature of Francis had given birth. He renewed his assurances of assuring Wolsey in obtaining the papacy; and he put him in present possession of the revenues belonging to the sees of Badajoz and Palencia in Spain. He flattered Henry\u2019s pride, by convincing him of his own importance, and of the truthness of the motto which he had chosen; offering to submit to his sole arbitration any difference that might arise between him and Francis.\n\nThis important point being secured, Charles repaired to Aix-la-Chapelle, where he was solemnly invested with the crown and sceptre of Charlemagne, in presence of a more splendid and numerous assembly than had appeared at any former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INAUGURATION\">inauguration</a>. About the same time Charles Solyman the Magnificent, one of the most accomplished, enterprising, and victorious of the Turkish princes, and a constant and formidable rival to the emperor, ascended the Ottoman throne.\n\nThe first act of Charles\u2019s administration was to appoint a diet of the empire, to be held at Worms, in order to concert with the princes proper measures for checking the progress of \u201cthose new and dangerous opinions which threatened to disturb the peace of Germany, and to overturn the religion of their ancestors.\u201d The opinions propagated by Luther and his followers were here meant. But all his efforts for that purpose were insufficient, as is related under the articles Luther and Reformation.\n\nIn 1521, the Spaniards, dissatisfied with the departure of their sovereign, whose election to the empire they foretold would interfere with the administration of his own kingdom, and incensed at the avarice of the Flemings, to whom the direction of public affairs had been\nSpain been committed since the death of Cardinal Ximenes, several grandees, in order to shake off this oppression, entered into an association, to which they gave the name of the Sancta Juncta; and the sword was appealed to as the means of redress. This seemed to Francis a favourable juncture for reinstituting the family of John d'Albert in the kingdom of Navarre. Charles was at a distance from that part of his dominions, and the troops usually stationed there had been called away to quell the commotions in Spain. A French army, under Andrew de Foix, speedily conquered Navarre; but that young and inexperienced nobleman, pushed on by military ardour, ventured to enter Castile. The Spaniards, though divided among themselves, united against a foreign enemy, routed his forces, took him prisoner, and recovered Navarre in a shorter time than he had spent in subduing it.\n\nHostilities thus begun in one quarter, between the rival monarchs, soon spread to another. The king of France encouraged the duke of Bouillon to make war against the emperor, and to invade Luxembourg. Charles, after humbling the duke, attempted to enter France; but was repelled and worsted before Mezieres by the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> Bayard, distinguished among his contemporaries by the appellation of The Knight without fear and without reproach; and who united the talents of a great general to the punctilious honour and romantic gallantry of the heroes of chivalry. Francis broke into the Low Countries, where, by an excess of caution, an error not natural to him, he lost an opportunity of cutting off the whole imperial army; and, what was of still more consequence, he disgusted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> Bourbon, by giving the command of the van to the duke of Alen\u00e7on.\n\nDuring these operations in the field, an unsuccessful congress was held at Calais, under the mediation of Henry VIII. It served only to exasperate the parties which it was intended to reconcile. A league was soon after concluded, by the intrigues of Wolsey, between the pope, Henry, and Charles, against France. Leo had already entered into a separate league with the emperor, and the French were fast losing ground in Italy.\n\nThe insolence and exactions of Marshal de Lautrec, governor of Milan, had totally alienated the affections of the Milanese from France. They resolved to expel the troops of that nation, and put themselves under the government of Francis Sforza, brother to Maximilian their late duke. In this resolution, they were encouraged by the pope, who excommunicated Lautrec, and took into his pay a considerable body of Swiss. The papal army, commanded by Prosper Colonna, an experienced general, was joined by supplies from Germany and Naples; while Lautrec, neglected by his court, and deserted by the Swiss in its pay, was unable to make head against the enemy. The city of Milan was betrayed by the inhabitants to the confederates; Parma and Placentia were united to the ecclesiastical state; and of their conquests in Lombardy, only the town of Cremona, the castle of Milan, and a few inconsiderable forts, remained in the hands of the French.\n\nLeo X. received the accounts of this rapid success with such transports of joy, as are said to have brought on a fever, which occasioned his death. The spirit of the confederacy was broken, and its operations suspended by this accident. The Swiss were recalled; some other mercenaries disbanded for want of pay; and only the Spaniards, and a few Germans in the emperor's service, remained to defend the duchy of Milan. But Lautrec, who with the remnant of his army had taken shelter in the Venetian territories, destitute both of men and money, was unable to improve this favourable opportunity as he wished. All his efforts were rendered ineffectual by the vigilance and ability of Colonna and his associates.\n\nMeantime much discord prevailed in the conclave. Wolsey's name, notwithstanding all the emperor's magnificent promises, was scarcely mentioned there. Julio de Medici, Leo's nephew, thought himself sure of the election; when, by an unexpected turn of fortune, Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht, Charles's preceptor, who at that time governed Spain in the emperor's name, was unanimously raised to the papacy, to the astonishment of all Europe and the great disgust of the Italians.\n\nFrancis, roused by the rising consequence of his rival, Francis in-revolted to exert himself with fresh vigour, in order to vade Italy, wrest from him his late conquests in Lombardy. Lautrec received a supply of money, and a reinforcement of 10,000 Swiss. With this reinforcement he was enabled once more to act offensively, and even to advance within a few miles of the city of Milan; when money again failing him, and the Swiss growing mutinous, he was obliged to attack the imperialists in their camp at Bicocca, where he was repulsed with great slaughter, having lost his bravest officers and best troops. Such of the Swiss as survived set out immediately for their own country; and Lautrec, despairing of being able to keep the field, retired into France. Genoa, which still remained subject to Francis, and made it easy to execute any scheme for the recovery of Milan, was soon after taken by Colonna: the authority of the emperor and his faction was everywhere established in Italy. The citadel of Cremona was the sole fortress which remained in the hands of the French.\n\nThe affliction of Francis for such a succession of misfortunes was augmented by the unexpected arrival of an English herald, who in the name of his sovereign declared war against France. The courage of this excellent prince, however, did not forsake him; though his treasury was exhausted by expensive pleasures, no less than by hostile enterprises, he assembled a considerable army, and put his kingdom in a posture of defence for resisting this new enemy, without abandoning any of the schemes which he was forming against the emperor. He was surprised, but not alarmed, at such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DENUNCIATION\">denunciation</a>.\n\nMeanwhile Charles, willing to draw as much advantage as possible from so powerful an ally, paid a second visit to the court of England in his way to Spain, where his presence was become necessary. His success exceeded his most sanguine expectations. He not only gained the entire friendship of Henry, who publicly ratified the treaty of Bruges; but disarmed the resentment of Wolsey, by afflicting him of the papacy on Adrian's death; an event seemingly not distant, by reason of his age and infirmities. In consequence of these negotiations an English army invaded France, under the command of the earl of Surrey; who, at the end of the campaign, was obliged to retire, with his forces greatly reduced,\nreduced, without being able to make himself master of one place within the French frontier. Charles was more fortunate in Spain: he soon quelled the tumults which had there arisen in his absence.\n\nWhile the Christian princes were thus wasting each other's strength, Solyman the Magnificent entered Hungary, and made himself master of Belgrade, reckoning the chief barrier of that kingdom against the Turkish power. Encouraged by this success, he turned his victorious arms against the island of Rhodes, at that time the seat of the knights of St John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; and though every prince in that age acknowledged Rhodes to be the great bulwark of Christendom in the east, so violent was their animosity against each other, that they suffered Solyman without disturbance to carry on his operations against that city and island. If the Adam, the grandmaster, made a gallant defence; but, after incredible efforts of courage, patience, and military conduct, during a siege of six months, he was obliged to surrender the place, having obtained an honourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> from the sultan, who admired and respected his heroic qualities (see Rhodes and Malta). Charles and Francis were equally ashamed of having occasioned such a loss to Christendom by their contests; and the emperor, by way of reparation, granted to the knights of St John the small island of Malta, where they fixed their residence, and continued long to retain their ancient spirit, though much diminished in power and splendour.\n\nAdrian VI., though the creature of the emperor, and devoted to his interest, endeavoured to assume the impartiality which became the common father of Christendom, and laboured to reconcile the contending princes, that they might unite in a league against Solyman, whose conquest of Rhodes rendered him more formidable than ever to Europe. The Italian states were no less desirous of peace than the pope; and so much regard was paid by the hostile powers to the exhortations of his holiness, and to a bull which he issued, requiring all Christian princes to consent to a truce for three years, that the imperial, the French, and the English ambassadors at Rome, were empowered to treat of that matter; but while they waited their time in fruitless negotiations, their masters were continuing their preparations for war; and other negotiations soon took place. The confederacy against France became more formidable than ever.\n\nThe Venetians, who had hitherto adhered to the French interest, formed engagements with the emperor for securing Francis Sforza in the possession of the duchy of Milan; and the pope, from a persuasion that the ambition of the French monarch was the only obstacle to peace, acceded to the same alliance. The Florentines, the dukes of Ferrara and Mantua, and all the Italian powers, followed this example. Francis was left without a single ally, to resist the efforts of a multitude of enemies, whose armies everywhere threatened, and whose territories encompassed his dominions. The emperor in person menaced France with an invasion on the side of Guienne; the forces of England and the Netherlands hovered over Picardy, and a numerous body of Germans was preparing to ravage Burgundy.\n\nThe dread of so many and such powerful adversaries, it was thought, would have obliged Francis to keep wholly on the defensive, or at least have prevented him from entertaining any thoughts of marching into Italy. But before his enemies were able to strike a blow, Francis had assembled a great army, with which he hoped to disconcert all the emperor's schemes, by marching it in person into Italy: and this bold measure, the more formidable because unexpected, could scarcely have marched to the desired effect, had it been immediately carried into execution. But the discovery of a domestic conspiracy, which threatened the destruction of his kingdom, obliged Francis to stop short at Lyons.\n\nCharles duke of Bourbon, lord high constable of France, was a prince of the most shining merit: his great talents equally fitted him for the council or the field, while his eminent services to the crown intitled him to its first favour. But unhappily Louisa duchess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGOULEME\">Angouleme</a>, the king's mother, had contracted a violent aversion against the house of Bourbon, and had taught her son, over whom she had acquired an absolute ascendancy, to view all the constable's actions with a jealous eye. After repeated affronts he retired from court, and began to listen to the advances of the emperor's ministers. Meantime the duchess of Bourbon died; and as the constable was no less amiable than accomplished, the duchess of Angouleme, still susceptible of the tender passions, formed the scheme of marrying him. But Bourbon, who might have expected everything to which an ambitious mind can aspire, from the doating fondness of a woman who governed her son and the kingdom, incapable of imitating Louisa in her sudden transition from hate to love, or of meanly counterfeiting a passion for one who had so long purified him with unprovoked malice, rejected the match with disdain, and turned the proposal into ridicule. At once despised and insulted by the man whom love only could have made her cease to persecute, Louisa was filled with all the rage of disappointed woman; she resolved to ruin, since she could not marry, Bourbon. For this purpose she commenced an iniquitous suit against him; and by the chicaneery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> du Prat, the constable was stripped of his whole family estate. Driven to despair by so many injuries, he entered into a secret correspondence with the emperor and the king of England; and he proposed, as soon as Francis should have crossed the Alps, to raise an insurrection among his numerous vassals, and introduce foreign enemies into the heart of France.\n\nHappily Francis got intimation of this conspiracy before he left the kingdom; but not being sufficiently convinced of the constable's guilt, he suffered so dangerous a foe to escape; and Bourbon entering into the emperor's service, employed all the force of his enterprising genius, and his great talents for war, to the prejudice of his prince and his native country.\n\nIn consequence of the discovery of this plot, and the escape of the powerful conspirator, Francis relinquished his intention of leading his army in person into Italy. He was ignorant how far the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> had spread among his subjects, and afraid that his absence might encourage them to make some desperate attempt in favour of a man so much beloved. He did not, however, abandon his design on the Milanese, but sent forward an army of 50,000 men, under the command of Admiral Bonnivet. Colonna, who was entrusted with the defence of that duchy, was in no condition to resist such a force; and the city of Milan, on which the whole territory depends,\npends, must have fallen into the hands of the French, had not Bonnivet, who possessed none of the talents of a general, wasted his time in frivolous enterprises, till the inhabitants recovered from their consternation. The imperial army was reinforced. Colonna died; and Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, succeeded him in the command; but the chief direction of military operations was committed to Bourbon and the marquis de Pescara, the greatest generals of their age. Bonnivet, destitute of troops to oppose this new army, and still more of the talents which could render him a match for its leaders, after various movements and encounters, was reduced to the necessity of attempting a retreat into France. He was followed by the imperial generals, and routed at Biagraffa, where the famous Chevalier Bayard was killed.\n\nThe emperor and his allies were less successful in their attempts upon France. They were baffled in every quarter; and Francis, though stripped of his Italian dominions, might still have enjoyed in safety the glory of having defended his native kingdom against one half of Europe, and have bid defiance to all his enemies; but underestimating that the king of England, discouraged by his former fruitless enterprises, and disfavored with the emperor, was making no preparations for any attempt on Picardy, his ancient ardour seized him for the conquest of Milan, and he determined, notwithstanding the advanced season, to march into Italy.\n\nThe French army no sooner appeared in Piedmont, than the whole Milanese was thrown into consternation. The capital opened its gates. The forces of the emperor and Sforza retired to Lodi; and had Francis been so fortunate as to pursue them, they must have abandoned that post, and been totally dispersed; but his evil genius led him to besiege Pavia, a town of considerable strength, well garrisoned, and defended by Antonio de Leyva, one of the bravest officers in the Spanish service; before which place he was defeated and taken prisoner on the twenty-fourth day of February 1524.\n\nThe captivity of Francis filled all Europe with alarm. Almost the whole French army was cut off; Milan was immediately abandoned; and in a few weeks not a Frenchman was left in Italy. The power of the emperor, and still more his ambition, became an object of universal terror; and resolutions were everywhere taken to set bounds to it. Meanwhile Francis, deeply impressed with a sense of his misfortune, wrote to his mother Louisa, whom he had left regent of the kingdom, the following short but expressive letter: \"All, Madam, is lost but honour.\" The same courier that carried this letter, carried also dispatches to Charles; who received the news of the signal and unexpected success which had crowned his arms with the most hypocritical moderation. He would not suffer any public rejoicings to be made on account of it; and said, he only valued it, as it would prove the occasion of restoring peace to Christendom. Louisa, however, did not trust to those appearances; if she could not preserve what was yet left, she determined at least that nothing should be lost through her negligence or weakness. Instead of giving herself up to such lamentations as were natural to a woman so remarkable for maternal tenderfeet, she discovered all the foresight, and exerted all the activity, of a consummate politician. She took every possible measure for putting the kingdom in a posture of defense, while she employed all her addresses to appease the resentment and to gain the friendship of England; and a ray of comfort from that quarter soon broke in upon the French affairs.\n\nThough Henry VIII. had not entered into the war against France from any concerted political views, he had always retained some imperfect idea of that balance of power which it was necessary to maintain between Charles and Francis; and the preservation of which he boasted to be his peculiar office. By his alliance with the emperor, he hoped to recover some part of those territories on the continent which had belonged to his ancestors; and therefore willingly contributed to give him the ascendancy above his rival; but having never dreamed of any event so decisive and fatal as the victory at Pavia, which seemed not only to have broken, but to have annihilated the power of Francis, he now became sensible of his own danger, as well as that of all Europe, from the loss of a proper counterpoise to the power of Charles. Instead of taking advantage of the distracted condition of France, Henry therefore determined to assist her in her present calamities. Some difficulties also had taken place between him and Charles, and still more between Charles and Wolsey. The elevation of the cardinal of Medici to St Peter's chair, on the death of Adrian, under the name of Clement VII., had made the English minister sensible of the infirmity of the emperor's promises, while it extinguished all his hopes of the papacy; and he resolved on revenge. Charles, too, had to ill support the appearance of moderation which he assumed, when first informed of his good fortune, that he had already changed his usual style to Henry; and instead of writing to him with his own hand, and subscribing himself \"your affectionate son and cousin,\" he dictated his letters to a secretary, and simply subscribed himself \"Charles.\" Influenced by all these motives, together with the glory of raising a fallen enemy, Henry listened to the flattering submissions of Louisa; entered into a defensive alliance with her as regent of France, and engaged to use his best offices in order to procure the deliverance of her son from a state of captivity.\n\nMeanwhile Francis was rigorously confined; and favorable conditions being proposed to him as the price of his liberty, he drew his dagger, and, pointing it at his breast, cried, \"T'were better that a king should die thus!\" His hand was withheld; and flattering himself, when he grew cool, that such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> could not come directly from Charles, he desired that he might be removed to Spain, where the emperor then resided. His request was complied with; but he languished long before he obtained a sight of his conqueror. At last he was favoured with a visit; and the emperor dreading a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> against him, or that Francis, as he threatened, might, in the obstinacy of his heart, resign his crown to the dauphin, agreed to abate somewhat of his former demands. A treaty was accordingly concluded at Madrid; in consequence of which Francis obtained his liberty. The chief article in this treaty was, that Burgundy should be restored to Charles as the rightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of his ancestors, and that Francis's two eldest sons should be immediately delivered up as hostages for the performance of the conditions stipulated. The exchange of the captive monarch\nmarch for his children was made on the borders between France and Spain. The moment that Francis entered his own dominions, he mounted a Turkish horse, and putting it to its speed, waved his hand, and cried aloud several times, \"I am yet a king! I am yet a king.\"\n\nFrancis never meant to execute the treaty of Madrid; he had even left a protest in the hands of notaries before he signed it, that his consent should be considered as an involuntary deed, and be deemed null and void. Accordingly, as soon as he arrived in France, he assembled the states of Burgundy, who protested against the article relative to their province; and Francis coldly replied to the imperial ambassadors, who urged the immediate execution of the treaty, that he would religiously perform the articles relative to himself, but in those affecting the French monarchy, he must be directed by the senate of the nation. He made the highest acknowledgements to the king of England for his friendly interposition, and offered to be entirely guided by his counsels. Charles and his ministers saw that they were over-reached in those very arts of negotiation in which they too much excelled, while the Italian states observed with pleasure, that Francis was resolved not to execute a treaty which they considered as dangerous to the liberties of Europe. Clement abdicated him from the oath which he had taken at Madrid; and the kings of France and England, the pope, the Swiss, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the duke of Milan, entered into an alliance, to which they gave the name of the Holy League, because his Holiness was at the head of it, in order to oblige the emperor to deliver up Francis's two sons on the payment of a reasonable ransom, and to re-establish Sforza in the quiet possession of the Milanese.\n\nIn consequence of this league, the confederate army took the field, and Italy once more became the scene of war. But Francis, who it was thought would have infused spirit and vigour into the whole body, had gone through such a scene of distress, that he was become diffident of himself, distrustful of his fortune, and desirous of tranquillity. He flattered himself, that the dread alone of such a confederacy would induce Charles to listen to what was equitable, and therefore neglected to send due reinforcements to his allies in Italy. Meantime the duke of Bourbon, who commanded the Imperialists, had made himself master of the whole Milanese, of which the emperor had promised him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a>; and his troops beginning to mutiny for want of pay, he led them to Rome, and promised to enrich them with the spoils of that city. He was as good as his word; for though he himself was slain in planting a scaling ladder against the walls, his soldiers, rather enraged than discouraged by his death, mounted to the assault with the utmost ardour, animated by the greatness of the prize, and, entering the city sword in hand, plundered it for several days.\n\nNever did Rome in any age suffer so many calamities, not even from the Barbarians, by whom she was often subdued, the Huns, Vandals, or Goths, as now from the subjects of a Christian and Catholic monarch. Whatever was respectable in modesty, or sacred in religion, seemed only the more to provoke the rage of the soldiery. Virgins suffered violation in the arms of their parents, and upon those altars to which they had fled for safety. Venerable prelates, after enduring every indignity and every torture, were thrown into dungeons, and menaced with the most cruel death, in order to make them reveal their secret treasures. Clement himself, who had neglected to make his escape in time, was taken prisoner, and found that the sanctity of his character could neither procure him liberty nor respect. He was confined till he should pay an enormous ransom. The pope imposed by the victorious army, and surrendered to the confines, all the places of strength belonging to the church.\n\nCharles received the news of this extraordinary event with equal surprise and pleasure; but in order to conceal his joy from his Spanish subjects, who were filled with horror at the insult offered to the sovereign pontiff, and to lessen the indignation of the rest of Europe, he expressed the most profound sorrow for the success of his arms. He put himself and his court into mourning; stopped the rejoicings for the birth of his son Philip, and ordered prayers to be put up in all the churches of Spain for the recovery of the pope's liberty, which he could immediately have procured by a letter to his generals.\n\nThe concern expressed by Henry and Francis for the calamity of their ally was more sincere. Alarmed at the progress of the imperial arms, they had, even before the taking of Rome, entered into a closer alliance, and agreed to invade the Low Countries with a powerful army; but no sooner did they hear of the pope's captivity, than they changed, by a new treaty, the scene of the projected war from the Netherlands to Italy, and resolved to take the most vigorous measures for restoring him to liberty. Henry, however, contributed only money. A French army entered Italy, under the command of Marshal Lautrec; Clement obtained his freedom; and war was for a time carried on by the confederates with success; but the death of Lautrec, and the revolt of Andrew Doria, a Genoese admiral in the service of France, entirely changed the face of affairs. The French army was utterly ruined; and Francis, discouraged and almost exhausted by so many unsuccessful enterprises, began to think of peace, and of obtaining the release of his sons by concessions, not by the terror of his arms.\n\nAt the same time Charles, notwithstanding the advantages he had gained, had many reasons to wish for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. Sultan Soliman having overrun Hungary, was ready to break in upon the Austrian territories with the whole force of the East; and the progress of the Reformation in Germany threatened the tranquillity of the empire. In consequence of this situation of affairs, though pride made both parties conceal or dissemble their real sentiments, two ladies were permitted to restore peace to Europe. Margaret of Austria, Charles's aunt, and Louisa, Francis's mother, met in 1529 at Cambrai, and settled the terms of accommodation between the French king and the emperor. Francis agreed to pay two millions of crowns as the ransom of his two sons, to resign the sovereignty of Flanders and Artois, and to forego all his Italian claims; and Charles ceased to demand the restitution of Burgundy.\n\nAll the steps of this negociation had been communicated to the king of England; and Henry was, on that occasion, so generous to his friend and ally Francis, that he sent him an acquittal of near six hundred thousand crowns, in order to enable him to fulfil his agreement.\nSpain. But Francis's Italian confederates were less satisfied with the treaty of Cambrai. They were almost wholly abandoned to the will of the emperor; and seemed to have no other means of security left but his equity and moderation. Of these, from his past conduct, they had not formed the most advantageous idea. But Charles's present circumstances, more especially in regard to the Turks, obliged him to behave with a generosity inconsistent with his character. The Florentines alone, whom he reduced under the dominion of the family of Medici, had reason to complain of his severity. Sforza obtained the investiture of Milan and his pardon; and every other power experienced the lenity of the conqueror.\n\nAfter having received the imperial crown from the hands of the pope at Bologna, Charles proceeded on his journey to Germany, where his presence was become highly necessary; for although the conduct and valour of his brother Ferdinand, on whom he had conferred the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria, and who had been elected king of Hungary, had obliged Solyman to retire with infamy and loss, his return was to be feared, and the disorders of religion were daily increasing; an account of which, and of the emperor's transactions with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>, is given under the article REFORMATION.\n\nCharles having exerted himself as much as he could against the reformers, undertook his first expedition against the piratical states of Africa. Barbary, or that part of the African continent lying along the coast of the Mediterranean sea, was then nearly in the same condition which it is at present. Morocco, Algiers, and Tunis, were its principal states; and the two last were nests of pirates. Barbarossa, a famous corsair, had succeeded his brother in the kingdom of Algiers, which he had formerly assisted him to usurp. He regulated with much prudence the interior police of his kingdom, carried on his piracies with great vigour, and extended his conquests on the continent of Africa; but perceiving that the natives submitted to his government with impatience, and fearing that his continual depredations would one day draw upon him a general combination of the Christian powers, he put his dominions under the protection of the grand seignior. Solyman, flattered by such an act of submission, and charmed with the boldness of the man, offered him the command of the Turkish fleet. Proud of this distinction, Barbarossa repaired to Constantinople, and made use of his influence with the sultan to extend his own dominion. Partly by force, partly by treachery, he usurped the kingdom of Tunis; and being now possessed of greater power, he carried on his depredations against the Christian states with more destructive violence than ever.\n\nDaily complaints of the piracies and ravages committed by the galleys of Barbarossa were brought to the emperor by his subjects, both in Spain and Italy; and all Christendom seemed to look up to him, as its greatest and most fortunate prince, for relief from this new and odious species of oppression. At the same time Muley-Hafcen, the exiled king of Tunis, finding none of the African princes able or willing to support him in recovering his throne, applied to Charles for assistance against the usurper. Equally desirous of delivering his dominions from the dangerous neighbourhood of Barbarossa, of appearing as the protector of an unfortunate prince, and of acquiring the glory annexed in that age to every expedition against the Mahometans, the emperor readily concluded a treaty with Muley-Hafcen, and sent for Tunis with a formidable armament. The Goletta, a sea-port town, fortified with 300 pieces of cannon, was taken, together with all Barbarossa's fleet: he was defeated in a pitched battle, and 10,000 Christian slaves, having knocked off their fetters, and Tunis made themselves masters of the citadel, Tunis was prepared for surrender. But while Charles was deliberating on the conditions, his troops fearing that they would be deprived of the booty which they had expected, broke suddenly into the town, and pillaged and massacred without distinction. Thirty thousand persons perished by the sword, and 10,000 were made prisoners. The sceptre was restored to Muley-Hafcen, on condition that he should acknowledge himself a vassal of the crown of Spain, put into the emperor's hands all the fortified sea-ports in the kingdom of Tunis, and pay annually 12,000 crowns for the subsistence of the Spanish garrison in the Goletta. These points being settled, and 20,000 Christian slaves freed from bondage either by arms or by treaty, Charles returned to Europe, where his presence was become necessary; while Barbarossa, who had retired to Bona, recovered new strength, and again became the tyrant of the ocean.\n\nThe king of France took advantage of the emperor's absence to revive his pretensions in Italy. The treaty terms in Cambrai had repented but not extinguished the fires of discord. Francis in particular, who waited pretensions only for a favourable opportunity of recovering the territories and reputation which he had lost, continued to negotiate against his rival with different courts. But all his negotiations were disconcerted by unforeseen accidents. The death of Clement VII., (whom he had gained by marrying his son the duke of Orleans, afterwards Henry II.) to Catherine of Medici, the niece of that pontiff), deprived him of all the support which he hoped to receive from the court of Rome. The king of England, occupied with domestic cares and projects, declined engaging in the affairs of the continent; and the Protestant princes, affiliated by the league of Smalkalde, to whom Francis had also applied, and who seemed disposed at first to listen to him, filled with indignation and resentment at the cruelty with which some of their reformed brethren had been treated in France, refused to have any connection with the enemy of their religion.\n\nFrancis was neither cruel nor bigotted; he was too indolent to concern himself about religious disputes; but his principles becoming suspected, at a time when the emperor was gaining immortal glory by his expedition against the infidels, he found it necessary to vindicate himself by some extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of reverence for the established faith. The indiscreet zeal of his barbarous Protestant converts furnished him with the occasion to do so. They had affixed to the gates of the Louvre and other public places papers containing indecent reflections on the rites of the Roman church. Six of the persons concerned in this rash action were seized; and the king, pretending to be struck with horror at their blasphemies, appointed a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, in order to avert the wrath of heaven. The holy sacrament was carried through the city of Paris in great pomp: Francis walked uncovered before it, bearing a torch in his hand;\nhand; the princes of the blood supported the canopy over it; the nobles walked behind. In presence of this numerous assembly, the king declared, that if one of his hands were infected with heresy, he would cut it off with the other; \"and I would sacrifice (added he) even my own children, if found guilty of that crime.\"\n\nAs an awful proof of his sincerity, the six unhappy persons who had been seized were publicly burnt, before the procession was finished, and in the most cruel manner. They were fixed upon a machine which descended into the flames, and retired alternately, until they expired.\u2014No wonder that the Protestant princes were incensed at such barbarity!\n\nFrancis, though unsupported by any ally, commanded his army to advance towards the frontiers of Italy, under pretence of chastising the duke of Milan for a breach of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\">law of nations</a>, in putting to death his ambassador. The operations of war, however, soon took a new direction. Instead of marching directly to the Milanese, Francis commenced hostilities against the duke of Savoy, with whom he had cause to be dissatisfied, and on whom he had some claims; and before the end of the campaign, this feeble prince saw himself deprived of all his dominions, except the province of Piedmont. To complete his misfortunes, the city of Geneva, the sovereignty of which he claimed, and where the reformed opinions had already got footing, threw off his yoke; and its revolt drew along with it the loss of the adjacent territory. Geneva was then an imperial city, and till lately remained entirely free.\n\nIn this extremity the duke of Savoy saw no resource but in the emperor's protection; and as his misfortunes were chiefly occasioned by his attachment to the imperial interest, he had a title to immediate assistance. But Charles, who was just returned from his African expedition, was not able to lend him the necessary support. His treasury was entirely drained, and he was obliged to disband his army till he could raise new supplies. Meanwhile the death of Sforza duke of Milan entirely changed the nature of the war, and afforded the emperor full leisure to prepare for action. The French monarch's pretext for taking up arms was at once cut off; but as the duke died without issue, all Francis's rights to the duchy of Milan, which he had yielded only to Sforza and his descendants, returned to him in full force. He instantly renewed his claim to it; and if he had ordered his army immediately to advance, he might have made himself master of it. But he unfortunately waited his time in fruitless negotiations, while his more politic rival took possession of the duchy as a vacant fief of the empire; and though Charles seemed still to admit the equity of Francis's claim, he delayed granting the investiture under various pretences, and was secretly taking every possible measure to prevent him from regaining footing in Italy.\n\nDuring the time gained in this manner, Charles had recruited his finances, and of course his armies; and finding himself in a condition for war, he at last threw off the mask under which he had so long concealed his designs from the court of France. Entering Rome with great pomp, he pronounced before the pope and cardinals, assembled in full consistory, a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INVECTIVE\">invective</a> against Francis, by way of reply to his propositions concerning the investiture of Milan. Yet Francis, by an unaccountable fatality, continued to negotiate, as if it had been still possible to terminate their differences in an amicable manner; and Charles, finding him so eager to run into the snare, favoured the deception, and, by seeming to listen to his proposals, gained yet more time for the execution of his ambitious projects.\n\nIf misfortunes had rendered Francis too dissident, circumstances had made Charles too sanguine. He presumed on nothing less than the subversion of the French monarchy; may he considered it as a certain event. Having chafed the forces of his rival out of Piedmont and Savoy, he pushed forward at the head of 50,000 men, contrary to the advice of his most experienced ministers and generals, to invade the southern provinces of France; while two other armies were ordered to enter it, the one on the side of Picardy, the other on the side of Champagne. He thought it impossible that Francis could resist so many unexpected attacks on such different quarters; but he found himself mistaken.\n\nThe French monarch fixed on the most effectual but difficult plan for defeating the invasion of a powerful enemy; appointed and he prudently persevered in following it, though contrary to his own natural temper and to the genius of his people. He determined to remain altogether upon the defensive, and to deprive the enemy of subsistence by laying waste the country before them. The execution of this plan was committed to the marshal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTMORENCY\">Montmorency</a> its author, a man happily fitted for such a trust by the inflexible severity of his disposition. He made choice of a strong camp, under the walls of Avignon, at the confluence of the Rhone and Durance, where he assembled a considerable army; while the king, with another body of troops, encamped at Valence, higher up the Rhone. Marfeilles and Arles were the only towns he thought it necessary to defend; and each of these he furnished with a numerous garrison of his best troops. The inhabitants of the other towns were compelled to abandon their habitations: the fortifications of such places as might have afforded shelter to the enemy were thrown down; corn, forage, and provisions of every kind, were carried off or destroyed; the mills and ovens were ruined, and the wells filled up or rendered useless.\n\nThis devastation extended from the Alps to Marfeilles, and from the sea to the confines of Dauphiny; so that the emperor, when he arrived with the van of his army on the confines of Provence, instead of that rich and populous country which he expected to enter, beheld nothing but one vast and desert solitude. He did not, however, despair of success, though he saw that he would have many difficulties to encounter; and as an encouragement to his officers, he made them liberal promises of lands and honours in France. But all the land which any of them obtained was a grave, and their master lost much honour by this rash and presumptuous enterprise. After unsuccessfully investing Marfeilles and Arles, after attempting in vain to draw Montmorency from his camp at Avignon, and not daring to attack it, Charles having spent two inglorious months in Provence, and lost one half of his troops by disease or by famine, was under the necessity of ordering a retreat; and though he was some time in motion before the enemy suspected his intention, it was conducted with so much precipitation and disorder, as to deserve the name of a flight, since the light troops of France turned it into a perfect rout. The invasion of Picardy\nPicardy was not more successful: the imperial forces were obliged to retire without effecting any conquest of importance.\n\nCharles had no sooner conducted the shattered remains of his army to the frontiers of Milan, than he set out for Genoa; and unwilling to expose himself to the scorn of the Italians after such a reverse of fortune, he embarked directly for Spain.\n\nMeanwhile Francis gave himself up to that vain resentment which had formerly disgraced the prosperity of his rival. They had frequently, in the course of their quarrels, given each other the lie, and mutual challenges had been sent; which, though productive of no serious consequences between the parties, had a powerful tendency to encourage the pernicious practice of duelling. Charles, in his invective pronounced at Rome, had publicly accused Francis of perfidy and breach of faith; Francis now exceeded Charles in the indecency of his accusations. The dauphin dying suddenly, his death was imputed to poison: Montecuccoli his cup-bearer was put to the rack; and that unhappy nobleman, in the agonies of torture, accused the emperor's generals Gonzaga and de Leyva, of intriguing him to the detestable act. The emperor himself was suspected; nay, this extorted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, and some obscure hints, were considered as incontestable proofs of his guilt; though it was evident to all mankind, that neither Charles nor his generals could have any inducement to perpetrate such a crime, as Francis was still in the vigour of life himself, and had two sons besides the dauphin, grown up to a good age.\n\nBut the incensed monarch's resentment did not stop here. Francis was not satisfied with endeavouring to blacken the character of his rival by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> testimony which led to the most injurious suspicions, and upon which the most cruel constructions had been put; he was willing to add rebellion to murder. For this purpose he went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of Paris; where being feasted with the usual solemnities, the advocate-general appeared, and accused Charles of Austria (so he affected to call the emperor) of having violated the treaty of Cambrai, by which he was freed from the homage due to the crown of France for the counties of Artois and Flanders; adding, that this treaty being now void, he was still to be considered as a vassal of France, and consequently had been guilty of rebellion in taking arms against his sovereign. The charge was sustained, and Charles was summoned to appear before the parliament of Paris at a day fixed. The term expired; and no person appearing in the emperor's name, the parliament gave judgement, that Charles of Austria had forfeited, by rebellion and contumacy, the counties of Flanders and Artois, and declared these fiefs reunited to the crown of France.\n\nFrancis, soon after this vain display of his animosity, marched into the Low Countries, as if he had intended to execute the sentence pronounced by his parliament; but a suspension of arms took place, through the intervention of the queens of France and Hungary, before anything of consequence was effected: and this cessation of hostilities was followed by a truce, concluded at Nice, through the mediation of the reigning pontiff Paul III., of the family of Farnese, a man of a venerable character and pacific disposition.\n\nEach of these rival princes had strong reasons to incline them to peace. The finances of both were exhausted; and the emperor, the more powerful of the two, was deeply impressed with the dread of the Turkish arms, which Francis had drawn upon him by a league with Soliman. In consequence of this league, Barba-leagues rossa with a great fleet appeared on the coast of Naples, filled that kingdom with consternation; landed without resistance near Taranto; obliged Caitro, a place of some strength, to surrender; plundered the adjacent country; and was taking measures for securing and extending his conquests, when the unexpected arrival of Doria, the famous Genoese admiral, together with the pope's galleys and a squadron of the Venetian fleet, made it prudent for him to retire. The sultan's forces also invaded Hungary, where Mahmet the Turkish general, after gaining several inferior advantages, defeated the Germans in a great battle at Effek on the Drave. Happily for Charles and Europe it was not in Francis's power at this juncture either to join the Turks or assemble an army strong enough to penetrate into the Milanese. The emperor, however, was sensible that he could not long resist the efforts of two such powerful confederates, nor expect that the same fortunate circumstances would concur a second time in his favour; he therefore thought it necessary, both for his safety and reputation, to give his consent to a truce: and Francis chose rather to run the risk of disobliging his new ally the sultan, than to draw on his head the indignation, and perhaps the arms, of all Christendom, by obstinately obstructing the re-establishment of tranquillity, and contributing to the aggrandizement of the Infidels.\n\nThese considerations inclined the contending monarchs to listen to the arguments of the holy father; but he found it impossible to bring about a final accommodation between them, each inflexibly persisting in asserting his own claims. Nor could he prevail on them to see one another, though both came to the place of rendezvous: so great was the remains of distrust and rancour, or such the difficulty of adjusting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a>! Yet, improvable as it may seem, a few days after signing the truce, between the emperor, in his passage to Barcelona, being driven on the coast of Provence, Francis invited him to come ashore; frankly visited him on board his galley, and was received and entertained with the warmest demonstrations of esteem and affection. Charles, with an equal degree of confidence, paid the king next day a visit at Aigues-mortes; where these two hostile rivals and vindictive enemies, who had accused each other of every kind of baseness, converging together with all the cordiality of brothers, seemed to vie with each other in expressions of respect and friendship.\n\nBesides the glory of having restored tranquillity to Advantage Europe, the pope gained a point of much consequence gained by to his family. He obtained for his grandson, Margaret, wife of Alexander de Medici, whom Charles had raised to the supreme power in Florence. Laurencin de Medici, the kinsman and intimate companion of Alexander, had assassinated him by one of the blackest treasons recorded in history. Under pretence of having secured him an afflagon with a lady of the highest rank and great beauty, he drew him into a secret apartment of his house, and there stabbed him as he lay carelessly on a couch, expecting the embrace of the lovely fair, whom he had often\nSpain often solicited in vain. Laurenein, however, did not reap the fruits of his crime; for though some of his countrymen extolled him as a third Brutus, and endeavoured to seize this occasion for recovering their liberties, the government of Florence passed into the hands of Cosimo II., another kinsman of Alexander. Cosimo was desirous of marrying the widow of his predecessor; but the emperor chose rather to oblige the pope, by bestowing his daughter upon Octavio Farnese, son of the duke of Parma.\n\nCharles had soon farther cause to be sensible of his obligations to the holy father for bringing about the treaty of Nice. His troops everywhere mutinied for want of pay, and the ability of his generals only could have prevented a total revolt. He had depended, as his chief resource for discharging the arrears due to his soldiers, upon the subsidies which he expected from his Cattilian subjects. For this purpose he assembled the Cortes of Castile at Toledo; and having represented to them the great expense of his military operations, he proposed to levy such supplies as the present exigency of affairs demanded, by a general excise on commodities; but the Spaniards, who already felt themselves oppressed by a load of taxes unknown to their ancestors, and who had often complained that their country was drained of its wealth and inhabitants, in order to prosecute quarrels in which they had no interest, determined not to add voluntarily to their own burdens. The nobles, in particular, inveighed with great vehemence against the imposition proposed, as an encroachment on the valuable and distinguishing privilege of their order, that of being exempted from the payment of any tax. After employing arguments and promises in vain, Charles dismissed the assembly with indignation; and from that period neither the nobles nor the prelates have been called to the Cortes, on pretence that such as pay no part of the public taxes should not claim a vote in laying them on. These assemblies have since consisted merely of the procurators or representatives of 18 cities, two from each; in all 36 members, who are absolutely at the devotion of the crown.\n\nThe citizens of Ghent, still more bold, broke out not long after into open rebellion against the emperor's government, on account of a tax which they judged contrary to their ancient privileges, and a decision of the council of Mechlin in favour of the imperial authority. Enraged at an unjust imposition, and rendered desperate on seeing their rights betrayed by that very court which was bound to protect them, they flew to arms, seized several of the emperor's officers, and drove such of the nobility as resided among them out of the city. Sensible, however, of their inability to support what their zeal had prompted them to undertake, and desirous of securing a protector against the formidable forces with which they might expect soon to be attacked, they offered to acknowledge the king of France as their sovereign, to put him into immediate possession of their city, and to assist him in recovering those provinces in the Netherlands which had anciently belonged to his crown. This policy dictated Francis to comply with this proposal. The counties of Flanders and Artois were more valuable than the duchy of Milan, for which he had so long contended; and their situation in regard to France made it more easy to conquer or to defend them. But Francis over-rated the Milanese. He had lived in friendship with the emperor ever since their interview at Aix-les-Bains, and Charles had promised him the investiture of that duchy. Forgetting, therefore, all his past injuries, and the deceitful promises by which he had been so often duped, the credulous, generous Francis, not only of Francis, rejected the propositions of the citizens of Ghent, but communicated to the emperor his whole negociation with the malecontents.\n\nJudging of Charles's heart by his own, Francis hoped by this seemingly disinterested proceeding to obtain at once the investiture of Milan; and the emperor, well acquainted with the weakness of his rival, flattered him in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, for his own selfish purposes. His presence being necessary in the Netherlands, he demanded the passage through France. It was immediately granted; and Charles, to whom every moment was precious, set out, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his council and the fears of his Spanish subjects, with a small but splendid train of 100 persons. He met on the frontiers of France by the dauphin and the duke of Orleans, who offered to go into Spain, and remain there as hostages, till he should reach his own dominions; but Charles replied, that the king's honour was sufficient for his safety, and prosecuted his journey without any other security. The king entertained him with the utmost magnificence at Paris, and the two young princes did not take leave of him till he entered the Low Countries; yet he still found means to evade his promise, and Francis continued to believe him sincere.\n\nThe citizens of Ghent, alarmed at the approach of the emperor, who was joined by three armies, sent ambassadors to implore his mercy, and offered to throw open their gates. Charles only condescended to reply, \"That he would appear among them as a sovereign and a judge, with the sceptre and the sword.\" He accordingly entered the place of his nativity on the anniversary of his birth; and instead of that lenity which might have been expected, exhibited an awful example of his severity. Twenty-five of the principal citizens were put to death: a greater number was banished: the city was declared to have forfeited its privileges; a new system of laws and political administration was prescribed; and a large fine was imposed on the inhabitants, in order to defray the expense of erecting a citadel, together with an annual tax for the support of a garrison. They were not only deprived of their ancient immunities, but made to pay, like conquered people, for the means of perpetuating their own slavery.\n\nHaving thus re-established his authority in the Low Countries, and being now under no necessity of contending with Francis, which he had amused the French monarch, Charles began gradually to throw aside the veil under which he had concealed his intentions with respect to the Milanese, and at last peremptorily refused to give up a territory of such value, or voluntarily to make such a liberal addition to the strength of an enemy by diminishing his own power. He even denied that he had ever made any promise which could bind him to an action so foolish, and so contrary to his own interest.\n\nThis translation exposed the king of France to as much scorn as it did the emperor to censure. The credulous simplicity of Francis seemed to merit no other return, after experiencing so often the duplicity and artifices of his rival. He remonstrated, however, and ex-\nclaimed as if this had been the first circumstance in which the emperor had deceived him. The insult offered to his understanding affected him even more feebly than the injury done to his interest; and he discovered such resentment as made it obvious that he would seize on the first opportunity of revenge, and that a new war would soon desolate the European continent.\n\nMeanwhile Charles was obliged to turn his attention towards the affairs of Germany. The Protestants having in vain demanded a general council, pressed him earnestly to appoint a conference between a select number of divines of each party, in order to examine the points in dispute. For this purpose a diet was assembled at Ratibon; and such a conference, notwithstanding the opposition of the pope, was held with great solemnity in the presence of the emperor. But the divines chosen to manage the controversy, though men of learning and moderation, were only able to settle a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> opinions, all points relative to worship and jurisdiction serving to inflame the minds of the disputants. Charles, therefore, finding his endeavours to bring about an accommodation ineffectual, and being impatient to close the diet, prevailed on a majority of the members to approve of the following edict of receds; viz. that the articles concerning which the divines had agreed, should be held as points decided; that those about which they had differed, should be referred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of a general council, or if that could not be obtained, to a national synod: and should it prove impracticable also to assemble a synod of Germany, that a general diet of the empire should be called within 18 months, in order to give final judgement on the whole controversy; that, in the mean time, no innovations should be attempted, nor any endeavours employed to gain profelytes.\n\nThis diet gave great offence to the pope. The bare mention of allowing a diet, composed chiefly of laymen, to pass judgement in regard to articles of faith, appeared to him no less criminal and profane than the worst of those heresies which the emperor seemed so zealous to suppress. The Protestants also were dissatisfied with it, as it considerably abridged the liberty which they at that time enjoyed. They murmured loudly against it; and Charles, unwilling to leave any seeds of discontent in the empire, granted them a private declaration, exempting them from whatever they thought injurious or oppressive in the receds, and affording them the full possession of all their former privileges.\n\nThe situation of the emperor's affairs at this juncture made these extraordinary concessions necessary. He foresaw a rupture with France to be unavoidable, and he was alarmed at the rapid progress of the Turks in Hungary. A great revolution had happened in that kingdom. John Zapol Sc\u00e6pus, by the assistance of Solyman, had wrested from the king of the Romans a considerable part of the country. John died, and left an infant son. Ferdinand attempted to take advantage of the minority, in order to repose himself of the whole kingdom; but his ambition was disappointed by the activity and address of George Martinuzzi, bishop of Waradin, who shared the regency with the queen. Sensible that he was unable to oppose the king of the Romans in the field, Martinuzzi satisfied himself with holding out the fortified towns, all of which he provided with every thing necessary for defence; and at the same time he sent ambassadors to Solyman, beseeching him to extend towards the son that imperial protection which had so generously maintained the father on his throne. Ferdinand used his utmost endeavours to thwart this negotiation, and even meanly offered to hold the Hungarian crown on the same ignominious condition by which John had held it, that of paying tribute to the Porte. But the sultan saw such advantages from effacing the interest of the young king, that he instantly marched into Hungary; and the Germans, having formed the siege of Buda, were defeated with great slaughter before that city. Solyman, however, instead of becoming the protector of the infant sovereign whom he had relieved, made use of this success to extend his own dominions: he sent the queen and her son into Transylvania, which province he allotted them, and added Hungary to the Ottoman empire.\n\nHappily for the Protestants, Charles received intelligence of this revolution soon after the diet at Ratibon; and by the concessions which he made them, he obtained such liberal supplies, both of men and money, as left him under little anxiety about the security of Germany. He therefore hastened to join his fleet and army in Italy\u2014undertook, in order to carry into execution a great and favourite an enterprise which he had concerted against Algiers; useful, though it would certainly have been more consistent with his dignity to have conducted the whole force against the empire against Solyman, the common enemy of Christendom, who was ready to enter his Austrian dominions. But many reasons induced Charles to prefer the African expedition: he wanted strength, or at least money, to combat the Turks in so distant a country as Hungary; and the glory which he had formerly acquired in Barbary led him to hope for the like success, while the cries of his Spanish subjects roused him to take vengeance on their invaders. But the unfortunate event of this expedition has already been related under the article Algiers, No. 14\u201420.\n\nThe loss which the emperor suffered in this calamitous expedition encouraged the king of France to begin between hostilities, on which he had been for some time resolved; Francis and an action dishonourable to civil society furnished Charles with too good a pretext for taking arms. The marquis del Guasto, governor of the Milanese, having got intelligence of the motions and destination of two ambassadors, Rincon and Fergoio, whom Francis had dispatched, the one to the Ottoman Porte, the other to the republic of Venice; knowing how much his matter wished to discover the intentions of the French monarch, and of what consequence it was to retard the execution of his measures, he employed some soldiers belonging to the garrison of Pavia to lie in wait for these ambassadors as they sailed down the Po, who murdered them and most of their attendants, and seized their papers. Francis immediately demanded reparation for this barbarous outrage; and as Charles endeavoured to put him off with an evasive answer, he appealed to all the courts of Europe, setting forth the enormities of the injury, the iniquity of the emperor in disdaining his just request, and the necessity of vengeance. But Charles, who was a more profound negotiator, defeated in a great measure the effects of these representations: he secured the fidelity of the Protestant princes in Germany, by granting them new concessions; and he engaged the king of England to espouse his cause, under pretence\npretence of defending Europe against the Infidels; while Francis was only able to form an alliance with the kings of Denmark and Sweden (who for the first time interested themselves in the quarrels of the more potent monarchs of the south), and to renew his treaty with Solyman, which drew on him the indignation of Christendom.\n\nBut the activity of Francis supplied all the defects of his negotiation. Five armies were soon ready to take the field, under different generals, and with different destinations. Nor was Charles wanting in his preparations. He and Henry a second time made an ideal division of the kingdom of France. But as the hostilities which followed terminated in nothing decisive, and were distinguished by no remarkable event, except the battle of Cerfoules (gained by Count d'Enguine over the imperialists, and in which 10,000 of the emperor's best troops fell), at last Francis and Charles, mutually tired of harassing each other, concluded at Crepsy a treaty of peace, in which the king of England was not mentioned; and from being implacable enemies, became once more, to appearance, cordial friends, and even allies by the ties of blood.\n\nThe chief articles of this treaty were, that all the conquests which either party had made since the truce of Nice should be restored; that the emperor should give in marriage to the duke of Orleans, either his own eldest daughter, with the Low Countries, or the second daughter of his brother Ferdinand, with the investiture of the Milanese; that Francis should renounce all pretensions to the kingdom of Naples, as well as to the sovereignty of Flanders and Artois, and Charles give up his claim to the duchy of Burgundy; and that both should unite in making war against the Turks.\n\nThe emperor was chiefly induced to grant conditions so advantageous to France, by a desire of humbling the Protestant princes in Germany. With the papal jurisdiction, he foresaw they would endeavour to throw off the imperial authority; and he determined to make his zeal for the former a pretence for enforcing and extending the latter. However, the death of the duke of Orleans before the consummation of his marriage, disentangled the emperor from the most troublesome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIPULATION\">stipulation</a> in the treaty of Crepsy; and the French monarch, being still engaged in hostilities with England, was unable to obtain any reparation for the loss which he suffered by this unforeseen event. These hostilities, like those between Charles and Francis, terminated in nothing decisive. Equally tired of a struggle attended with no glory or advantage to either, the contending princes concluded, at Campe, near Ardies, a treaty of peace; in which it was stipulated, that France should pay the arrears due by former treaties to England. But these arrears did not exceed one-third of the sums expended by Henry on his military operations; and Francis being in no condition to discharge them, Boulogne (a chargeable pledge) was left in the hands of the English as a security for the debt.\n\nIn consequence of the emperor's resolution to humble the Protestant princes, he concluded a dishonourable peace with the Porte, stipulating that his brother Ferdinand should pay tribute for that part of Hungary which he still possessed; while the sultan enjoyed the imperial and undisturbed possession of all the rest. At the same time he entered into a league with Pope Paul III. for the extirpation of heresy; but in reality with a view to oppress the liberties of Germany. Here, however, his ambition met with a severe check; for though he was successful at first, he was obliged in 1552 to conclude a peace with the Protestants on their own terms; as has been related under the article REFORMATION, No. 26\u201432.\n\nBy the peace concluded on this occasion the emperor Attempts to recover Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which had formed the barrier of the empire on that quarter; and therefore some of his forces put himself at the head of an army, in order provinces to recover these three bishoprics. In order to conceal the destination of his army, he gave out, that he intended to lead it into Hungary, to second Maurice in his operations against the Infidels; and as that pretext failed him, when he began to advance towards the Rhine, he propagated a report that he was marching first to chastise Albert of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDENBURG\">Brandenburg</a>, who had refused to be included in the treaty of Passau, and whose cruel exactions in that part of Germany called loudly for redress.\n\nThe French, however, were not deceived by these arts. Henry immediately quelled the true object of Charles's to raise the armament, and resolved to defend his conquests with vigour. The defence of Metz, against which it was foreseen the whole weight of the war would be turned, was committed to Francis of Lorraine, duke of Guise, who possessed in an eminent degree all the qualities that render men great in military command. He repaired with joy to the dangerous station; and many of the French nobility, and even princes of the blood, eager to distinguish themselves under such a leader, entered Metz as volunteers. The city was of great extent, ill fortified, and the suburbs large. For all these defects the duke endeavoured to provide a remedy. He repaired the old fortifications with all possible expedition, labouring with his own hands; the officers imitated his example; and the soldiers, thus encouraged, cheerfully submitted to the most severe toils; he erected new works, and he levelled the suburbs with the ground. At the same time he filled the magazines with provisions and military stores, compelled all useless persons to leave the place, and laid waste the neighbouring country; yet such were his popular talents, as well as his arts of acquiring ascendancy over the minds of men, that the citizens not only refrained from murmuring, but seconded him with no less ardour than the soldiers in all his operations\u2014in the ruin of their estates, and in the havoc of their public and private buildings.\n\nMeanwhile the emperor continued his march towards Lorraine, at the head of 60,000 men. On his approach Albert of Brandenburg, whose army did not exceed 20,000 withdrew into that principality, as if he intended to join the French king; and Charles, notwithstanding the advanced season, it being towards the end of October, laid siege to Metz, contrary to the advice of his most experienced officers.\n\nThe attention of both the besiegers and the besieged was turned for some time towards the motions of Albert, who still hovered in the neighbourhood, undetermined which side to take, though resolved to sell his service. Charles at last came up to his price, and he joined the imperial army. The emperor now flattered himself that nothing could resist his force; but he found himself deceived. After a siege of almost 60 days, during\nring which he had attempted all that was thought possible for art or valour to effect, and had lost upwards of 30,000 men by the inclemency of the weather, diseases, or the sword of the enemy, he was obliged to abandon the enterprise.\n\nWhen the French fell out to attack the enemy's condition of rear, the imperial camp was filled with the sick and wounded, with the dead and the dying. All the roads by which the army retired were fired with the same miserable objects; who, having made an effort beyond their strength to escape, and not being able to proceed, were left to perish without assistance. Happily that, and all the kind offices which their friends had not the power to perform, they received from their enemies. The duke of Guise ordered them all to be taken care of, and supplied with every necessary; he appointed physicians to attend, and direct what treatment was proper for the sick and wounded, and what refreshments for the feeble; and such as recovered he sent home, under an escort of soldiers, and with money to bear their charges. By these acts of humanity, less common in that age, the duke of Guise completed that heroic character which he had justly acquired by his brave and successful defence of Metz.\n\nThe emperor's misfortunes were not confined to Germany. During his residence at Villach, he had been obliged to borrow 200,000 crowns of Colmo de Medici; and so low was his credit, that he was obliged to put Cofino in possession of the principality of Piombino as a security for that inconsiderable sum; by which means he lost the footing he had hitherto maintained in Tuscany. Much about the same time he lost Sienna. The citizens, who had long enjoyed a republican government, rose against the Spanish garrison, which they had admitted as a check upon the tyranny of the nobility, but which they found was meant to enslave them; forgetting their domestic animosities, they recalled the exiled nobles; they demolished the citadel, and put themselves under the protection of France.\n\nTo these unfortunate events one still more fatal had almost succeeded. The severe administration of the viceroy of Naples had filled that kingdom with murmuring and dissatisfaction. The prince of Salerno, the head of the malecontents, fled to the court of France. The French monarch, after the example of his father, applied to the grand signior; and Solyman, at that time highly incensed against the house of Austria on account of the proceedings in Hungary, sent a powerful fleet into the Mediterranean, under the command of the corsair Dragut, an officer trained up under Barbarossa, and scarcely inferior to his master in courage, talents, or in good fortune. Dragut appeared on the coast of Calabria at the time appointed; but not being joined by the French fleet according to concert, he returned to Constantinople, after plundering and burning several places, and filling Naples with consternation.\n\nHighly mortified by so many disasters, Charles retired into the Low Countries, breathing vengeance against France; and here the war was carried on with considerable vigour. Impatient to efface the stain which his military reputation had received before Metz, Charles laid siege to Terouane; and the fortifications being in disrepair, that important place was carried by assault.\n\nHesdin also was invested, and carried in the same manner. The king of France was too late in assembling his forces to afford relief to either of these places; and the emperor afterwards cautiously avoided an engagement.\n\nThe imperial arms were less successful in Italy. The viceroy of Naples failed in an attempt to recover Sienna; and the French not only established themselves more firmly in Tuscany, but conquered part of the island of Corfica. Nor did the affairs of the house of Austria go on better in Hungary during the course of this year. Isabella and her son appeared once more in Transylvania, at a time when the people were ready for revolt, in order to revenge the death of Martinuzzi, whose loss they had severely felt. Some noblemen of eminence declared in favour of the young king; and the bailiwick of Belgrade, by Soliman's order, espousing his cause, in opposition to Ferdinand, Caetano, the Austrian general, was obliged to abandon Transylvania to Isabella and the Turks.\n\nIn order to counterbalance these and other losses, the emperor, in 1554, concerted a marriage between his son Philip and Mary of England, in hopes of adding that kingdom to his other dominions. Meanwhile the war between Henry and Charles was carried on with various success in the Low Countries, and in Italy much to the disadvantage of France. The French, under the command of Strozzi, were defeated in the battle of Merciano; Sienna was reduced by Medicino, the Florentine general, after a siege of ten months; and the gallant Siennese were subjected to the Spanish yoke. Much about the same time a plot was formed by the Franciscans, but happily discovered before it could be carried into execution, to betray Metz to the Imperialists. The father guardian, and twenty other monks, received sentence of death on account of this conspiracy; but the guardian, before the time appointed for his execution, was murdered by his incensed accomplices, whom he had seduced; and six of the youngest were pardoned.\n\nWhile war thus raged in Italy and the Low Countries, Germany enjoyed such profound tranquillity, as afforded the diet full leisure to confirm and perfect the plan of religious pacification agreed upon at Passau, and referred to the consideration of the next meeting of the Germanic body. During the negotiation of this treaty, an event happened which astonished all Europe, and confounded the reasonings of the wisest politicians.\n\nThe emperor Charles V, though no more than 66, an age when objects of ambition operate with full force on his mind, and are generally pursued with the greatest ardour, had for some time formed the resolution of resigning his hereditary dominions to his son Philip. He now determined to put it in execution. Various have been the opinions of historians concerning a resolution so singular and unexpected; but the most probable seems to be, the disappointments which Charles had met with in his ambitious hopes, and the daily decline of his health. He had early in life been attacked with the gout; and the fits were now become so frequent and severe, that not only the vigour of his constitution was broken, but the faculties of his mind were sensibly impaired. He therefore judged it more decent to conceal his infirmities in some solitude, than to expose them any longer to the public eye; and as he was unwilling\nSpain. to forfeit the fame, or lose the acquisitions of his better years, by attempting to guide the reins of government when he was no longer able to hold them with steadiness; he determined to seek in the tranquillity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, that happiness which he had in vain pursued amidst the tumults of war and the intrigues of state.\n\nIn consequence of this resolution, Charles, who had already ceded to his son Philip the kingdom of Naples and the duchy of Milan, assembled the states of the Low Countries at Brussels; and feasting himself for the last time in the chair of state, he explained to his subjects the reasons of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a>, and solemnly devolved his authority upon Philip. He recounted with dignity, but without ostentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed since the commencement of his administration. \"I have dedicated (observed he), from the 17th year of my age, all my thoughts and attention to public objects, reserving no portion of my time for the indulgence of ease, and very little for the enjoyment of private pleasure. Either in a pacific or hostile manner, I have visited Germany nine times, Spain five times, France four times, Italy seven times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often; and while my health permitted me to discharge the duty of a sovereign, and the vigour of my constitution was equal in any degree to the arduous office of governing such extensive dominions, I never flinched, nor repined under fatigue; but now, when my health is broken, and my vigour exhausted by the rage of an incurable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>, my growing infirmities admonish me to retire; nor am I so fond of reigning, as to retain the sceptre in an impotent hand, which is no longer able to protect my subjects. Instead of a sovereign worn out with diseases (continued he), and scarce half alive, I give you one in the prime of life, already accustomed to govern, and who adds to the vigour of youth all the attention and sagacity of maturer years.\" Then turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees, and kissed his father's hand, \"It is in your power (said Charles), by a wise and virtuous administration, to justify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my paternal affection, and to demonstrate that you are worthy of the extraordinary confidence which I repose in you. Preserve (added he) an inviolate regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be sacred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights of your people; and if the time should ever come when you shall wish to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a son to whom you can resign your sceptre with as much satisfaction as I give up mine to you.\" A few weeks after, he resigned to Philip the sovereignty of Spain and America; reserving nothing to himself out of all these vast possessions but an annual pension of 100,000 crowns.\n\nCharles was now impatient to embark for Spain, where he had fixed on a place of retreat; but by the advice of his physicians, he put off his voyage for some months, on account of the severity of the season; and, by yielding to their judgment, he had the satisfaction before he left the Low Countries of taking a considerable step towards a peace with France. This he ardently longed for; not only on his son's account, whose administration he wished to commence in quietness, but that he might have the glory, when quitting the world, of restoring to Europe that tranquillity which his ambition had banished out of it almost from the time that he assumed the reins of government.\n\nThe great bar to such a pacification, on the part of France, was the treaty which Henry had concluded with the Pope; and the emperor's claims were too numerous to hope for adjusting them suddenly. A truce of five years was therefore proposed by Charles; during which term, without discussing their respective pretensions, each should retain what was in his possession; and Henry, through the persuasion of the confable Montmorency, who represented the imprudence of sacrificing the true interests of his kingdom to the rash engagements that he had come under with Paul, authorized his ambassadors to sign at Vaucelles a treaty, which would injure to him for so considerable a period the important conquest which he had made on the German frontier, together with the greater part of the duke of Savoy's dominions.\n\nThe Pope, when informed of this transaction, was no less filled with terror and astonishment than rage and indignation. But he took equal care to conceal his fear and his anger. He affected to approve highly of the truce; and he offered his mediation, as the common father of Christendom, in order to bring about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFINITIVE\">definitive</a> peace. Under this pretext, he appointed Cardinal Reibio his nuncio to the court of Brussels, and his nephew Cardinal Caraffa to that of Paris. The public instructions of both were the same; but Caraffa, besides these, received a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, to spare neither intrigues, promises, nor bribes, in order to induce the French monarch to renounce the truce and renew his engagements with the holy see. He flattered Henry with the conquest of Naples; he gained by his address the Guises, the queen, and even the famous Diana of Poitiers, duchess of Valentinois, the king's mistress; and they easily swayed the king himself, who already leaned to that side towards which they wished to incline him. All Montmorency's prudent remonstrances were disregarded; the nuncio (by powers from Rome) absolved Henry from his oath of truce; and that weak prince signed a new treaty with the Pope; which rekindled with fresh violence the flames of war, both in Italy and the Low Countries.\n\nNo sooner was Paul made acquainted with the success of this negotiation than he proceeded to the most vexatious indecent extremities against Philip. He ordered the pope and Spanish ambassador to be imprisoned; he excommunicated the Colonnas, because of their attachment to the imperial house; and he considered Philip as guilty of high treason, and to have forfeited his right to the kingdom of Naples, which he was supposed to hold of the holy see, for afterward affording them a retreat in his dominions.\n\nAlarmed at a quarrel with the Pope, whom he had been taught to regard with the most superstitious veneration, as the vicegerent of Christ and the common father of Christendom, Philip tried every gentle method before he made use of force. He even consulted some Spanish divines on the lawfulness of taking arms against a person so favored. They decided in his favour; and Paul continuing inexorable, the duke of Alva, to whom\nthe negotiations as well as the war had been committed, entered the ecclesiastical state at the head of 12,000 veterans, and carried terror to the gates of Rome.\n\nThe haughty pontiff, though still inflexible and undaunted himself, was forced to give way to the fears of the cardinals, and a truce was concluded for 40 days. Mean time the duke of Guise arriving with a supply of 20,000 French troops, Paul became more arrogant than ever, and banished all thoughts from his mind but those of war and revenge. The duke of Guise, however, who had precipitated his country into this war, chiefly from a desire of gaining a field where he might display his own talents, was able to perform nothing in Italy worthy of his former fame. He was obliged to abandon the siege of Civette; he could not bring the duke of Alva to a general engagement; his army perished by disease; and the Pope neglected to furnish the necessary reinforcements. He begged to be recalled; and France stood in need of his abilities.\n\nPhilip, though willing to have avoided a rupture, was no sooner informed that Henry had violated the truce of Vaucelles, than he determined to act with such vigour, as should convince Europe that his father had not erred in resigning to him the reins of government. He immediately assembled in the Low Countries a body of 50,000 men, and obtained a supply of 10,000 from England, which he had engaged in his quarrel; and as he was not ambitious of military fame, he gave the command of his army to Emmanuel Philibert duke of Savoy, one of the greatest generals of that warlike age.\n\nThe duke of Savoy kept the enemy for some time in suspense with regard to his destination; at last he seemed to threaten Champagne; towards which the French drew all their troops; then turning suddenly to the right, he advanced by rapid marches into Picardy, and laid siege to St Quintin. It was deemed in those times entirely deserted a town of considerable strength; but the fortifications had been much neglected, and the garrison did not amount to a fifth part of the number requisite for its defence; it must therefore have surrendered in a few days, if the admiral de Coligny had not taken the gallant resolution of throwing himself into it with such a body of men as could be collected on a sudden. This he effected in spite of the enemy, breaking through their main body. The place, however, was closely invested; and the constable Montmorency, anxious to extricate his nephew out of that perilous situation, in which his zeal for the public had engaged him, as well as to save a town of such importance, rashly advanced to its relief with forces one half inferior to those of the enemy. His army was cut in pieces, and he himself made prisoner.\n\nThe cautious temper of Philip on this occasion saved France from devastation, if not ruin. The duke of Savoy proposed to overlook all inferior objects, and march speedily to Paris, which, in its present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, he could not have failed to make himself master of; but Philip, afraid of the consequences of such a bold enterprise, deferred him to continue the siege of St Quintin, in order to secure a safe retreat in case of any disastrous event. The town, long and gallantly defended by Coligny, was at last taken by storm; but not till France was in a state of defence.\n\nPhilip was now sensible that he had lost an opportunity which could never be recalled, of distressing his enemy, and contented himself with reducing Horn and Catlet; which petty towns, together with St Quintin, were the sole fruits of one of the most decisive victories gained in the 16th century. The Catholic king, however, continued in high exultation on account of his success; and as all his passions were tinged with superstition, he vowed to build a church, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a>, and a palace, in honour of St Laurence, on the day sacred to whose memory the battle of St Quintin had been fought. He accordingly laid the foundation of an edifice, in which all these were included, and which he continued to forward at vast expense, for 22 years. The same principle which dictated the vow directed the building. It was so formed as to resemble a gridiron\u2014on which culinary instrument, according to the legendary tale, St Lawrence had suffered martyrdom. Such is the origin of the famous Escorial near Madrid, the royal residence of the kings of Spain.\n\nThe first account of that fatal blow which France had received at St Quintin, was carried to Rome by the courier whom Henry had sent to recall the duke of Guise. Paul remonstrated warmly against the departure of the French army; but Guise's orders were peremptory. The arrogant pontiff therefore found it necessary to accommodate his conduct to the exigency of his affairs, and to employ the mediation of the Venetians, and of Cosimo de Medici, in order to obtain peace. The first overtures of this nature were eagerly listened to by the Catholic king, who still doubted the justice of his cause, and considered it as his greatest misfortune to be obliged to contend with the Pope. Paul agreed peace conditions to renounce his league with France; and Philip stipulated, on his part, that the duke of Alva should repair in person to Rome, and after asking pardon of the holy father in his own name and in that of his master, for having invaded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a> of the church, should receive absolution from that crime. Thus Paul, through the superstitious timidity of Philip, finished an unpatriotic war not only without any detriment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTOLIC\">apostolic</a> see, but saw his conqueror humbled at his feet: and so excessive was the veneration of the Spaniards in that age for the papal character, that the duke of Alva, the proudest man perhaps of his time, and accustomed from his infancy to converse with princes, acknowledged, that when he approached Paul, he was so much overawed, that his voice failed, and his presence of mind forsook him.\n\nBut though this war, which at its commencement threatened mighty revolutions, was terminated without occasioning any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in those states which were its immediate object, it produced effects of considerable consequence in other parts of Italy. In order to detach Ostatino Farnese, duke of Parma, from the French interest, Philip restored to him the city of Placentia and its territory, which had been seized by Charles V., and he granted to Cosimo de Medici the investiture of Siena, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> for the sums due to him. By these treaties, the balance of power among the Italian states was poised with more equality, and rendered less variable than it had been since it received the first violent shock from the invasion of Charles VIII., and Italy henceforth ceased to be the theatre on which the monarchs of Spain, France, and Germany, contended for fame and dominion. Their hostilities, excited by new objects, stained other regions of Europe with blood,\nThe duke of Guise, who left Rome the same day that his adversary the duke of Alva made his humiliating submission to the Pope, was received in France as the guardian angel of the kingdom. He was appointed lieutenant-general in chief, with a jurisdiction almost unlimited; and, eager to justify the extraordinary confidence which the king had reposed in him, as well as to perform something suitable to the high expectations of his countrymen, he undertook in winter the siege of Calais. Having taken that place, he next invested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-THIONVILLE\">Thionville</a> in the duchy of Luxembourg, one of the strongest towns on the frontiers of the Netherlands; and forced it to capitulate after a siege of three weeks. But the advantages on this quarter were more than balanced by an event which happened in another part of the Low Countries. The mar\u00e9chal de Termes governor of Calais, who had penetrated into Flanders and taken Dunkirk, was totally routed near Gravelines, and taken prisoner by Count Egmont. This disaster obliged the duke of Guise to relinquish all his other schemes, and hasten towards the frontiers of Picardy, that he might there oppose the progress of the enemy.\n\nThe eyes of all France were now turned towards the duke of Guise, as the only general on whose arms victory always attended, and in whose conduct as well as good fortune they could confide in every danger. His strength was nearly equal to the duke of Savoy's, each commanding about 40,000 men. They encamped at the distance of a few leagues from one another; and the French and Spanish monarchs having joined their respective armies, it was expected that, after the vicissitudes of war, a decisive battle would at last determine which of the rivals should take the ascendancy for the future in the affairs of Europe. But both monarchs, as if by agreement, stood on the defensive; neither of them discovering any inclination, though each had it in his power, to risk the decision of a point of such importance on the issue of a single battle.\n\nDuring this state of inaction, peace began to be mentioned in each camp, and both Henry and Philip discovered an equal disposition to listen to any overture that tended to re-establish it. The private inclinations of both kings concurred with their political interests and the wishes of their people. Philip languished to return to Spain, the place of his nativity, and peace only could enable him, either with decency or safety, to quit the Low Countries. Henry was now desirous of being freed from the avocations of war, that he might have leisure to turn the whole force of his government towards suppressing the opinions of the reformers, which were spreading with such rapidity in Paris and the other great towns, that they began to grow formidable to the established church. Court-intrigues conspired with the public and avowed motives to hasten the negociation, and the abbey of Cercamp was fixed on as the place of congress.\n\nWhile Philip and Henry were making these advances towards a treaty which restored tranquillity to Europe, Charles V., whose ambition had so long disturbed it, but who had been for some time dead to the world, ended his days in the monastery of St. Justus in Estremadura, which he had chosen as the place of his retreat, as is particularly related under the article Charles V.\n\nAfter the death of Charles, the kingdom of Spain soon lost great part of its consequence. Though Charles had used all his interest to get his son Philip elected emperor of Germany, he had been totally disappointed; and thus the grandeur of Philip II. never equalled that of his father. His dominions were also considerably abridged by his tyrannical behaviour in the Netherlands. In consequence of this, the United Provinces revolted, and after a long and bloody war obtained their liberty. Revolt of Philip, which brought on a war with Spain. The great losses sustained in these wars exhausted the kingdom of both men and money, notwithstanding the great sums imported from America. Indeed the discovery of that country has much impoverished, instead of enriching Spain; for thus the inhabitants have been rendered lazy and averse to every kind of manufacture or traffic, which only can be a durable source of riches and strength to any nation. Expulsion of the Moors, and its bad consequences. The ruin of the kingdom in this respect, however, was completed by Philip III., who, at the instigation of the inquisition, and by the advice of his prime minister the duke of Lerma, expelled from the kingdom all the Morefores to Spain or Moors, descendants of the ancient conquerors of Spain. Thirty days only were allowed them to prepare for their departure, and it was death to remain beyond that time. The reason for this barbarous decree was, that these people were still Mahometans in their hearts, though they conformed externally to the rites of Christianity, and thus might corrupt the true faith. The Morefores, however, chose themselves a king, and attempted to oppose the royal mandate; but, being almost entirely unprovided with arms, they were forced to submit, and were all banished the kingdom. By this violent and impolitic measure, Spain lost almost a million of industrious inhabitants; and as the kingdom was already depopulated by bloody wars, by repeated emigrations to America, and enervated by luxury, it now sank into a state of languor from which it has never recovered.\n\nThe reign of Philip IV., the successor of Philip III., commenced in 1621. He had not been long seated on the throne before the expiration of the 12 years truce which Philip III. had concluded with the United Provinces, again involved Spain in the calamities of war. The renewed contest was carried on with vigour by both the contending powers, till in the year 1648 the Spanish monarch was compelled to sign the treaty of Munster, by which the United Provinces were declared free and independent. From this period the power of the Spanish monarchy began to decline, as it had already been severely shaken by the loss of Portugal.\n\nThis event took place in 1640, when the Portuguese finally threw off the Spanish yoke, and that country remained an independent kingdom, till the power of Bonaparte compelled its lawful monarch to abandon his European territories. Philip IV. also prosecuted an unsuccessful war with France. This war was terminated in 1659, and Philip died about six years after.\n\nThe new monarch, Charles II., was only four years old when he succeeded to the throne. He was of a feeble constitution, and a weak capacity. The war which had been occasioned by the revolt of Portugal, continued till the year 1668, when a peace was concluded, and the independence of that kingdom was acknowledged. Hostilities had been renewed with France, but...\nbut greatly to the disadvantage of the Spaniards, who lost some of the richest and best fortified towns which they still possessed in Flanders. The peace of Nim\u00e8gue between France and Spain was signed in the year 1678. Charles II. died in 1700, and with him ended the male line of the house of Austria; a dynasty to which Spain owes less than to any other race of its monarchs.\n\nHistorians have been fond of representing the dominion of the Austrian princes in Spain as productive of the greatest glory and advantage to that kingdom. The reign of Charles V. may indeed be said to have been a glorious reign; but little of its glory belonged to Spain, and the emperor certainly neglected her interests in advancing those of his more favoured territories. The picture given by the Spanish historians of the state of Spain at the accession and during the reign of Philip II. fully evinces how little that kingdom had profited by the change in the line of its succession. Agriculture was neglected; commerce was fettered by enormous duties, and the people were held in the chains of ignorance and superstition.\n\nCharles II. was succeeded by Philip V. duke of Anjou, and grandson to Louis XIV. of France, who had been nominated heir to the Spanish throne by the late monarch. The transactions of the war which was soon declared against France and Spain, by England, Holland, and the empire, assisted by Savoy, Portugal, and Prussia, have been already related under the article BRITAIN, from No. 345 to No. 371. The treaty of Utrecht, which terminated the differences between the principal contending powers, was signed in 1713, and in 1715 a permanent peace was concluded between Spain and Portugal. Hostilities, however, still continued with Savoy and Sardinia, and in 1715 the island of Sardinia was taken by a Spanish fleet, and the year following another fleet belonging to the same nation invaded Sicily, but was defeated by the British admiral Byng. By a new treaty in 1720, Sardinia was given to the duke of Savoy, and Sicily to the emperor; and by the treaty of Seville, concluded in 1729, the duchies of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, were ceded to Spain. In 1731, the Spanish king invaded Naples, took possession of that kingdom, and conferred it on his son Don Carlos, in consequence of which war was declared between Spain and the empire in 1733. At the end of that year the palace of Madrid was consumed by fire, and all the archives relating to the Indies perished in the flames.\n\nIn 1739, hostilities were renewed between Spain and Britain, (see BRITAIN, No. 403); but the only successes acquired by the latter power were the capture of Porto Bello by Admiral Vernon, and that of the Manila galleon by Commodore Anson. After a long and turbulent reign, Philip V. died in 1746.\n\nFerdinand VI., a mild, prudent, and beneficent prince, reformed abuses in the administration of justice, and management of the finances. He revived commerce, established manufactures, and promoted the prosperity of his kingdom. In April A.D. 1755, Quito in South America was destroyed by an earthquake.\n\nCharles III. succeeded Ferdinand in 1759. The famous family compact was concluded at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>, A.D. 1761, among the four kings of the house of Bourbon. The English, alarmed by the naval preparations of Spain, declared war in 1762 (see BRITAIN, No. 450), and took Havana in the island of Cuba, and Manilla in the East Indies. Notwithstanding this success, peace was hastily concluded at Fontainebleau, in November, by which the Havana was restored. In 1767 the Jesuits were expelled from Spain. An unsuccessful expedition was concerted against Algiers, A.D. 1775, the particulars of which are related in M. Swinburne's Travels, letter v. In the war between Great Britain and her American colonies, Spain, by the intrigues of the French court, was prevailed on to take up arms in support of the latter. At the conclusion of that calamitous war, Great Britain in a treaty with Spain, ceded to this power, East and West Florida, and the island of Minorca. Charles died in 1788, and was succeeded by his second son, Charles Anthony prince of Asturias, the eldest having been declared incapable of inheriting the crown.\n\nCharles IV. had not long been seated on the throne before the potentates revolution in France involved Europe in a general scene of political and military contest. The king of Spain joined the general confederacy against the new republic, and in consequence was numbered among the objects of its resentment, by a declaration of war in 1793. The military operations of Spain, however, were extremely languid; and after two campaigns, the commencement of offensive war, against the republican armies of France (see FRANCE, No. 411), he was compelled to conclude a treaty of peace, which was signed at Basil on the 22nd July 1795. By this treaty the French republic restored to the king of Spain all the conquests which he had made from him since the commencement of hostilities, and received in exchange all right and property in the Spanish part of St Domingo.\n\nThis treaty was soon followed by a rupture with Great Britain. On 5th October 1796, the court of Spain published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANIFESTO\">manifesto</a> against this country, to which the court of London made a spirited reply; and about the same time was published a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance, which had been concluded about two months before, between the king of Spain and the French republic. In the war which followed between Spain and Great Britain, his Catholic majesty could boast of but little honour or success; and the French republic gained little from its new ally, but the contributions of money, which the time from time compelled him to advance. On the 14th of February 1797, a Spanish fleet of 27 sail of the line was defeated by Sir John Jervis off Cape St Vincent (see FRANCE, No. 482); and four of the Spanish line of battle ships were left in the hands of the victors. From this time till the temporary termination of hostilities by the peace of Amiens in 1802, there is nothing remarkable in the transactions of Spain.\n\nOn the renewal of the war in 1803, Spain was again compelled, by the overbearing power of France, to take an active part against Great Britain, and fitted out a formidable fleet, which was united to a considerable naval force of the new-made emperor of the French. The Spanish declaration of war against Britain is dated at Madrid on the 12th of December 1804; and on the 21st of October 1805, the combined fleets of France and Spain were nearly annihilated by Lord Nelson's decisive victory off Cape Trafalgar.\n\nAfter this terrible blow to the naval power of Spain, nothing\nSpain. nothing of importance took place till 1808, when the designs of Bonaparte against the independence of Spain, which had been long suspected, were openly avowed, in consequence of a domestic dispute, probably fomented by the emissaries of France, which took place between Charles IV. and the prince of Asturias. During the winter of 1827-8 the public mind in Spain had been greatly agitated. Some accused the prince of the Peace, Don Manuel Godoy, (who had long held the helm of state, and was the richest and most powerful subject in the kingdom), of having concerted with the queen to destroy the prince of Asturias. Others accused the prince of Asturias of being at the head of a party to dethrone his father. Solemn councils and long proceedings, followed up by exiles and violent acts, far from calming opinions, served to agitate them still more.\n\nIn March 1828 several disturbances happened at Aranjuez. These disturbances were excited by a report that the royal family were about to quit Spain and emigrate to America. In consequence of this report, the populace of the neighbouring villages repaired in crowds to Aranjuez, where they found the attendants of the court packing up the baggage of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>; and understood that relays of horses were stationed on the road to Seville, and that every thing was prepared for the departure of the royal fugitives, who were to take shipping at that port. It was suspected that Don Manuel Godoy, or, as he has commonly been called, the prince of the Peace, was the chief instigator of this unpopular measure; and the fury of the people was directed chiefly against that nobleman, whose palace they attacked on the 18th of March. He, however, found means to escape for the present, but was afterwards arrested in a garret of his own house. In the meantime the king issued two decrees with a view to allay the popular ferment; but as this still continued, he on the 19th took the extraordinary resolution of abdicating the throne in favour of the prince of Asturias. This resolution was made known by a royal decree, in which Charles declared that, as his natural infirmities no longer permitted him to support the weight of government, and the re-establishment of his health required a change of climate, he had after the most mature deliberation resolved to abdicate his crown in favour of his heir the prince of Asturias; and this resolution he declared to be the result of his own free will.\n\nThe new sovereign was accordingly proclaimed by the title of Ferdinand VII., and issued an edict confiscating the effects of Don Manuel Godoy, and announcing the appointment of the duke of Infanteado, a nobleman deservedly popular for his talents and virtues, to the presidency of Castile and the command of the royal guards.\n\nThese disturbances have commonly been attributed to the machinations of the French emperor, who had gained a complete ascendancy over the weak Charles; and had rendered the prince of the Peace entirely subservient to the views which he had formed on the independence and the liberties of Spain. How far this supposition is correct, it is impossible for us at this time to determine; but it is rendered probable by the active measures taken about this time by Napoleon to awe by a French force the Spanish nation. Murat the grand duke of Berg was at this time on his march towards the capital with a body of French troops; and his march was hastened by the information which he had received of the tumults at Aranjuez. This general caused it to be intimated to Ferdinand, that the emperor of the French was on his journey to Spain, and advised him to meet his master on the road. In the mean time he was tampering with the self-deposed monarch, whom he assured of the affiances of Bonaparte in reinstating him on the throne. Charles accordingly addressed a letter to Bonaparte, in which he contradicts the assertion of his decree of the 19th; and declares that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABDICATION\">abdication</a> was a measure of compulsion; and throws himself on the protection of that great monarch, his friend and ally, from whom alone he and his subjects can hope to derive tranquillity and happiness.\n\nIt appears to have been the design of Murat to draw Bonaparte out of Spain the whole of the royal family, and in this design he completely succeeded. Ferdinand set out to meet Bonaparte, accompanied by the French general Savary, and had advanced as far as Vittoria, where he was left by Savary, and where he found himself surrounded by French troops. He was compelled to remain at Vittoria, until Savary, who had proceeded to Bayonne, where Bonaparte then was, should return and intimate to him the pleasure of his master. When the general returned, he brought with him a letter from Napoleon to Ferdinand. In this letter, which is addressed to Ferdinand as prince of Asturias, and not as king of Spain, Bonaparte assured the prince, that the sole object of his journey into Spain was to make such reforms in that kingdom as would be agreeable to the public feelings. Without pretending to judge respecting the late revolution, he cautions Ferdinand against the danger to be apprehended from sovereigns permitting their subjects to take justice into their own hands. After intimating his own power over the royal family of Spain, and adverting to the tumults that had taken place, in which some of his troops had fallen, he makes use of the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, \"a few of my soldiers may be murdered; but the subjugation of Spain shall be the consequence of it.\"\n\nFerdinand confounded at the conduct of the French emperor, and alarmed for his own personal safety, was compelled to proceed on his journey. When he arrived at Bayonne he was received by the prince of Neuchatel and Duroc, and was conducted to a place by no means suited to his rank or his character as ally of Bonaparte. He however dined with the emperor; but after he had retired, General Savary brought a message from his master, intimating his determination that the present royal family of Spain should give up to him all right and title to the crown of that kingdom, and that they should be succeeded by a branch of his own family. Astonished at this intimation, Ferdinand sent his prime minister Cevallos, to canvass the matter with M. Champagny, the confidential secretary of Napoleon. The conference was held in an apartment adjoining the cabinet of the emperor, and, as it appeared, within his hearing; for when Cevallos was arguing with great warmth and strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on the injustice and even impiety of the proposed measures, both he and Champagny were ordered into the emperor's presence; and the former was reviled in the grossest terms, branded with the appellation of a traitor, accused of having maintained that the recognition of Bonaparte was not necessary to the validity of his master's title to the throne of Spain, and of\nSpain having affirmed that if the French dared to attack the independence of the Spanish monarchy, three hundred thousand men would rise to defend it and repel the invaders. After Napoleon had thus indulged the violence of his temper, he entered in a harsh and arrogant style on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of the points in dispute between his secretary and Cevallos; and finding that he could neither convince nor silence the Spanish minister, he abruptly concluded with the following peremptory declaration: \"I have a system of policy of my own; you ought to adopt more liberal ideas, to be less susceptible on the point of honour, and not sacrifice the prosperity of Spain to the interest of the House of Bourbon.\" From this time the destiny of the Spanish royal family was fixed. Ferdinand the monarch of the people's choice was already a captive, and not many days elapsed before the rest of the royal family was in the same situation. On the first of May, Ferdinand had made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a> renunciation of his crown in favour of his father, and on the fifth of the same month Bonaparte had a long conversation with Charles the fourth and his queen. Ferdinand was called in by his father, to hear, in the presence of him and the queen, the disgusting and humiliating expressions which were uttered by the French emperor, expressions of such a nature, that Cevallos says he dares not record them. All the parties were treated except Ferdinand; he was ordered by his father to make an absolute renunciation of the crown, on pain of being treated as an usurper and a conspirator against the right of his parents. With this requisition Ferdinand complied, and thus completed the abdication of his family; for it appeared that on the preceding day Charles had executed the deed of resignation, which transferred to the emperor of the French his title to the crown of Spain, on consideration of receiving during his life an annuity of eighty millions of reals, or a dowry to his queen of two millions of reals, and to the infant of Spain the annual sum of four hundred thousand livres.\n\nThus had Bonaparte effected the transference of the Spanish nation from the Bourbon dynasty to his own family, so far at least as that transference could be effected by the formal renunciation in his favour of the royal family, and by a strong but fulsorific recommendation from them to the Spanish nation to receive their new sovereign, whoever he should be, with submission and obedience. Filled as the annals of mankind are with examples of treachery, perfidy, and violence, it would be difficult to point out a deed which in every part of its performance, in its own nature, or in the character of the means by which it was effected, bears such strong marks of unjust and lawless tyranny.\n\nIt was soon understood that Napoleon designed the crown of Spain for his brother Joseph, who had some time before been placed on the throne of Naples. In an address to the Spanish nation, which Bonaparte published immediately after the abdication of Charles and Ferdinand, he informed them that he did not mean to reign over them in person, but that he would give them a sovereign every way resembling himself. In the beginning of June Joseph Bonaparte arrived in the neighbourhood of Bayonne, where he was received by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> of the grandees of Spain and from the council of Castile, and presented with a congratulatory address, written in the most fulsome style of adulation, on his accession to the Spanish throne.\n\nBut though the nomination of Joseph Bonaparte was easily effected, it was not so easy to place him on the throne in opposition to the almost unanimous will of the Spanish nation. Ferdinand the seventh was the darling of the people; and his accession to the crown had been hailed by them, both as placing them under the dominion of a beloved monarch, and as releasing them from the tyranny of Godoy, who was an object of almost universal detestation. They had hitherto submitted with patience to the influence and power of France, hopeless of resisting themselves while Charles possessed the throne, and while the prince of the Peace directed his councils; but the accession of Ferdinand, and the consequent disgrace of the favourite, had led them to hope that they should now find a sovereign willing to direct and assist their efforts to regain their independence. Under these expectations, a great part of the nation had come forward to offer their assistance in supporting the claims of the new monarch. The province of Catalonia, the most industrious and the most warlike of the Spanish nation, particularly distinguished itself by the promptitude and extent of its offers. Soon after Ferdinand had ascended the throne, the captain-general of Catalonia, relying on the well-known resources and dispositions of the inhabitants, had come forward with an offer of a military force of above a hundred thousand men; and other provinces would have followed this example, but Ferdinand had discouraged their military preparations, and appeared willing to submit quietly to French bondage.\n\nThe spirit which had animated the Spaniards thus boldly to support their favourite sovereign, was not of a nature to be chilled and repelled by his timidity or example. The hatred which they had conceived against the French daily found fresh sources of nourishment. They saw Ferdinand, who had rejected their proffered services lest he should expose himself to the suspicion or displeasure of Bonaparte, enticed by deceit, or compelled by violence, to relinquish his kingdom and commit himself to the power of his enemy. They anticipated the consequences, and prepared to resist them with vigour and unanimity. The renunciation of the royal family in favour of Bonaparte was no sooner known in Spain, than the northern provinces burst into open insurrection. Asturias and Galicia set the glorious example; and it was soon followed by almost every part of Spain, not immediately occupied or overawed by the armies of France.\n\nOne of the first steps taken by the leaders of the insurrection was, to assemble the juntas or general assemblies of the provinces. When these were organized, they issued proclamations, calling on the Spaniards to rise in defence of their sovereign, and in the assertion of their own independence. Besides these proclamations from the provincial juntas, addresses were published in almost every province by the leaders of the popular cause; in particular, the province of Aragon was addressed by Palafox, a name celebrated in the annals of the Spanish revolution, in a bold and spirited manifesto. The junta of Seville, which assembled on the 27th of May, formed itself into a supreme junta of government, caused Ferdinand to be proclaimed king of Spain, took possession of the military stores, and issued an order for all males from 16 to 45, who had not children, to enroll themselves in the national armies.\n\nIt was natural that, when entering on so determined\nan opposition to the measures of Bonaparte, the Spaniards should turn their eyes towards that nation, by whom alone the ambitious views of that potentate had been successfully combated. A peace and alliance with Britain was evidently not only a measure of policy, but would afford them the most effectual assistance in the formidable struggle in which they were about to engage. Accordingly, deputies were dispatched to Great Britain from several of the provinces, to solicit the aid and friendship of that country, and to concert measures with the British ministry for executing the plans which had been contrived for freeing the kingdom from the French yoke. The junta of Seville issued a declaration of war with France, and declared the Spanish nation on terms of peace and amity with Britain. The Spanish deputies were empowered to solicit supplies of arms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMMUNITION\">ammunition</a>, clothing and money; but it was thought that a supply of British troops would be unnecessary, the Spanish patriots considering themselves as fully equal to the defence of their country. The cause of the Spanish patriots was eagerly embraced by the court of London, and by the British nation at large, and the most active measures were quickly taken to lend them effectual aid.\n\nWhile these preparations were making on the part of the Spaniards, the French forces were collecting in great numbers, both on the frontiers, and in the neighbourhood of the capital. Above 25,000 men, under the command of Bellieres and Laffoles, threatened the provinces of Asturias and Biscay, or occupied the plains of Castile. Ten thousand men were shut up in the citadel of Barcelona; and to relieve them, a strong body of French troops had marched from the frontiers, and laid siege to Zaragoza. A considerable body under General Moncey attacked the city of Valencia; while the grand duke of Berg, after having detached General Dupont at the head of 20,000 men, to quiet the insurrection of the southern provinces, held Madrid with about 15,000 troops. Junot, with about 25,000 men, had entered Portugal, and taken possession of the capital. The whole French force at this time in Spain cannot be computed at less than 100,000 men. These were opposed by a very numerous, but undisciplined force, commanded by generals of acknowledged bravery, but differing widely from each other in experience and military prudence. General Palafox commanded in Aragon; General Caffanos in the southern provinces; and General Blake in the north.\n\nThe first exertions of the Spanish patriots were eminently successful, though they have been greatly exaggerated in the newspapers published under authority of the juntas. The harbour of Cadiz, which contained a numerous and well-appointed fleet, was under the command of the marquis de Solano, a man notoriously attached to the French interest; and here lay a French fleet, consisting of five ships of the line and a frigate. One of the first efforts of the patriots was, to obtain possession both of Cadiz and the French fleet, and in this they completely succeeded. Solano was arrested and put to death, and Don Morla was appointed in his room. In the beginning of June the French fleet was summoned to surrender, and on the admiral's refusal, was furiously attacked by the batteries on shore, and obliged to capitulate. The force detached by Murat, under Dupont, was attacked near Baylon, on the 22d July, by Major-general Reding, second in command under Caffanos, and after having been defeated, was compelled to surrender at discretion. The French force besieging Zaragoza, was repeatedly attacked by General Palafox, and suffered considerable losses, while that city held out with the most heroic bravery. Perhaps there are few instances in the annals of modern warfare, in which such persevering and successful courage has been displayed, as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEFENDERS\">defenders</a> of Zaragoza. All the means of attack which were in possession of the French, directed by the skill with which their long experience and success had supplied them, were made use of. The inhabitants were obliged continually to be upon their guard, and to be prepared to resist the most unexpected and secret, as well as the most open and violent assaults. The city was frequently bombarded in the middle of the night, at the same time that the gates were attempted to be forced, under cover of the shells. More than once the French got into some parts of the town; but they were received with so much coolness and bravery, that they were never able to preserve what they had with so much difficulty and loss acquired. The women vied with their husbands, sons, and brothers, in the display of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and contempt of danger: regardless of the fire of the enemy, they rushed into the very middle of the battle, administering support and refreshment to the exhausted and wounded, and animating, by their exhortations and example, all ranks to such a display of firmness and bravery as long secured this important city. When it is recollected, that the attacks of the French were numerous and varied, that they were constantly repeated with fresh, and generally with increasing forces, and that the sole defence of the city relied with its spirited inhabitants and the army of Palafox; some idea may be formed of the difficulties they must have undergone and surmounted, and of the glory to which they are so justly entitled. The patriots had gained possession of most of the sea ports in the bay of Biscay, and headed by the bishop of St. Andrea, repulsed the French in several attacks. The French force under General Moncey was also repulsed before Valencia, and the patriots were equally successful in several other quarters; so that by the end of July there did not remain above 40,000 French forces within the Spanish territory.\n\nIn the meantime preparations were making at Madrid for the reception of the new sovereign Joseph; and Murat, flight under pretence of ill health, quitted the capital, to give Joseph Bonaparte way to the brother of his master. Joseph Bonaparte arrived at Madrid in the latter end of July, with a guard of 10,000 men; but soon after his arrival the news of the defeat and capitulation of Dupont reached Madrid, and threw the new court into the utmost consternation. They understood that the victorious army of Caffanos was on its march towards the capital; and if he did not speedily retire from so dangerous a position, King Joseph dreaded either falling into the hands of the conqueror of Dupont, or of being intercepted in his retreat by the army of General Blake. In this situation he found himself under the necessity of quitting the capital which he had so lately entered, and before the end of the month he had reached Burgos in his precipitate flight towards the frontiers. Thus, within the space of two months, did the people of Spain behold their country almost entirely freed from the presence of the French; and this glorious and happy issue had been brought about by their own intrepidity. At a time when their situation was the most dispiriting and for-\nSpain.\n\nlorn; when their king had been compelled to forsake them, and to make over his right to the throne to a foreign potentate; when they beheld scarcely any troops surrounding them on all sides, but those of that potentate, they rose in arms, and opposed themselves, unfitted as they were in war, and totally unprepared for it, to a man before whom the mightiest empires in Europe had fallen.\n\nThe successes of the Spanish arms, though brilliant and important, were but transient. The leaders of the insurrection appear to have been but ill calculated to oppose the system of tactics which had been so often practised with success by the conqueror of Marengo, of Jena, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTERLITZ\">Austerlitz</a>. Though the conquests of Austria and Prussia had been effected by the same system which the French were now pursuing in Spain, the military men of this kingdom were incapable of analyzing them, or of adopting effectual measures of opposition or defence. In a series of about 30 bulletins, published from the French army of Spain, comprehending from the beginning of November 1808 to the middle of January 1809, we read of nothing but the rapid movements and successes of the French, and the defeat and annihilation of the best appointed armies of the insurgents. In Galicia, General Blake, after having withstood the duke of Dantzig (Marshal Ney), in several encounters, was at length defeated, and his army dispersed. A division of the army of Extremadura, under Count <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELVEDERE\">Belvedere</a>, which had marched from Madrid to support the city of Burgos, was attacked and defeated by a division of the French army under the dukes of Istria and Dalmatia; while the army of General Ca\u00f1izares was in a great measure dispersed, after a severe conflict on the heights of Tudela. According to the French account, the army of Ca\u00f1izares consisted of 45,000 men. It was opposed by the duke of Montebello, and entirely defeated, with the loss of nearly 4000 killed, and 3000 taken prisoners.\n\nIn the meantime Bonaparte had entered Spain, and taken the command of the French army. He advanced by rapid marches towards Madrid, and at the end of November his advanced guard reached the important pass of Somosierra. This pass was defended by a body of 13,000 Spaniards, with fifteen pieces of cannon. They were attacked by the French under the duke of Belluno, and after making a considerable stand, were entirely defeated. On the 2d of December Bonaparte arrived in the neighbourhood of Madrid, and on the 5th he was master of that capital.\n\nWhile the Spanish patriots were thus pursuing their plan of opposition to French tyranny with various successes, the British cabinet were fitting out formidable expeditions to the coasts of Spain and Portugal. The result of the expedition under Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Arthur Wellesley, the battle of Vimiera, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a> of Cintra, and the consequent evacuation of Portugal by the French, in the month of August 1808, have been already noticed under Portugal, No 49 and 50. After these transactions, the greater part of the British army under the command of Lieutenant-general Sir John Moore, proceeded on their march to the frontiers of Spain. The progress and operations of this army will be detailed mentioned. About the middle of the same month, a body of 13,000 British troops, under the command of Sir David Baird, arrived at Corunna, and proceeded through the interior of the country, intending to join Sir John Moore in the neighbourhood of Madrid. A brigade of 10,000 men under General Hope, reached that capital, and established themselves at the Efeiral; but on the approach of Bonaparte, were under the necessity of retiring.\n\nExperience has shown that in their military campaigns on the continent, British forces have to contend with numerous difficulties, surmountable only by the utmost prudence and vigilance on the part of the commanding officers, and by a considerable degree of skill and foresight on that of the projectors of such undertakings. Never perhaps were these difficulties more severely felt than in the march of Sir John Moore from Portugal to the centre of the Spanish territory. It was found that in whatever direction he might prosecute his march, he would encounter either bad roads or scanty supplies of provisions. In particular, the difficulty of transporting the artillery over the Portuguese mountains was extreme; and the Portuguese at Lisbon were either egregiously ignorant of the state of the roads which led through their own country to the Spanish frontiers, or were unwilling to communicate the information which they really possessed. Under these circumstances it was found necessary to divide the British army; and it was determined to send forward one division consisting of 6000 men under the command of Lieutenant-General Hope, which was directed to march by Elvas, to enter Spain by Badajoz, and to proceed along the Madrid road by way of Elpinar. Another division, consisting of two brigades under General Paget, was detached by way of Elvas and Alcantara, where it was to pass the Tagus. Two brigades under General Beresford moved through Portugal by way of Coimbra and Almeida towards Salamanca, while three brigades under General Frazer marched towards the frontiers of Spain by Abrantes and Almeida.\n\nBurgos had been recommended by the Spanish government as the point of union for the British troops, and Madrid and Valladolid were appointed for magazines. The British had been led to expect that they would find between 60,000 and 70,000 Spaniards assembled under General Blake and the marquis de la Romana in the provinces of Alturas and Galicia, and that a much greater number was ready to co-operate with them under the command of Ca\u00f1izares on the front and left of the principal French position. The Spaniards had been represented as unanimous in their enthusiasm for the cause of liberty, and as ready to treat the British troops as the favourites of their country. How far this information was correct, will be seen presently.\n\nIn marching through the Portuguese territory, the troops first encountered difficulties which they were not prepared to expect. The contractor at Lisbon, who had agreed to supply the divisions with rations on the march, failed in his contract, and excessive inconvenience was experienced from the want of money. The divisions under Generals Frazer and Beresford were obliged to halt, and it was some time before they could again set forward. The proceedings of the central junta, on which all the movements both of the British and Spanish armies chiefly depended, were languid, tardy, and irrefutable; and before the British troops could advance in any force in Spain, the principal armies of the patriots had been defeated and dispersed in almost every\nSpain. every quarter. On the 8th of November Sir John Moore reached Almeyda. The weather was at this time extremely unfavourable, and the troops were exposed to almost incessant rain. They entered Spain on the 11th of November, and on the 13th Sir John arrived with his advanced guard at Salamanca, where he halted, intending to assemble there all the troops which were on their march through Portugal. While he remained at Salamanca, he was informed that a considerable French force had advanced and taken possession of Valladolid, at the distance of only twenty leagues, by which one of the places that had been intended for magazines was lost. At this time Sir John had with him only three brigades of infantry without artillery, and it would be at least ten days before the whole of the divisions could come up. He was thus exposed to almost an immediate attack by the French without any effectual support from the boasted patriotism of the Spaniards.\n\nThe situation of affairs in Spain had now become extremely critical; and every account sent to Sir John Moore by men of sound judgment, was filled with convincing proofs that the Spanish government had concealed from their ally the very desperate state of their affairs. General Hope, by a long and tiresome march, had reached the neighbourhood of Madrid, whence he wrote a letter to Sir John, stating that every branch was affected by the disjointed and inefficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the government. On the 28th of November Sir John was advertised of the late defeat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of Ca\u00f1izares, and of the little probability there was of his being able to march forward, so as to effect anything of advantage. He therefore determined to fall back, though this determination was evidently in opposition to the wishes and advice of his officers. Fresh dispatches, however, from the seat of government, diminishing the losses which had been sustained by the patriots, and exaggerating the ardour with which the people were actuated, induced him to delay his retreat, especially as he had now a complete, though small corps, with cavalry and artillery, and could, by a movement to the left, easily effect a junction with Sir David Baird, while the division under General Hope had, by rapid marches, arrived in the neighbourhood of Salamanca.\n\nIn addition to the misrepresentations by which the commanders of the British forces, and the British envoy at Aranjuez, had been deceived, they had now to contend with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> men, who, it soon appeared, were in the French interest. These were Don Morla, the late governor of C\u00e1diz, and a M. Charmilly. By the machinations of these men, Mr Frere was led to advise, and Sir John Moore strongly incited to undertake, bringing the whole of the British force to the neighbourhood of Madrid, where they would soon have been completely within the power of the enemy. Though by these arts Sir John was effectually misled, he did not suffer himself to be drawn into so dangerous a snare. He, however, advanced beyond Salamanca, and sent forward the reserve and General Beresford's brigade towards Toro on the Douro, where they were to unite with the cavalry under Lord Paget, who had advanced thither from Altorga. On December 12th, Lord Paget, with the principal part of the cavalry, marched from Toro to Tordefilas, while the brigade under General Stewart moved from Arivolo. In the vicinity of Tordefilas, near the village of Rueda, the British forces were first opposed by the French, a small party of whom were attacked and defeated.\n\nWhile Sir John Moore was at Toro, he received intelligence that the duke of Dalmatia was at Saldana with a considerable body of French troops, that Junot, duke of Abrantes, was marching with another towards Burgos, and that a third under the duke of Trevilo was destined for Zaragoza. He was very desirous that the first of these generals should advance to meet him, and with this view he had come forward to Toro, which he reached on the 16th of December. He had hoped for effectual assistance from the corps commanded by the marquis de la Romana, but he soon found that this general could render him no support. He had now resolved to threaten the communication between France and Madrid; and, if a favourable opportunity offered, to attack the duke of Dalmatia's corps, or any of the covering divisions that should present themselves. He foresaw that this would necessarily draw upon him a large French force, and of course would prove an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a> in favour of the Spaniards; who would by this means have the opportunity of collecting in the south, and restoring their affairs. The army was now near the French position. The cavalry under Lord Paget were pushed so forward, that their patrols reached as far as Valladolid, and had frequent successful skirmishes with the enemy. Colonel Otway met a detachment of French cavalry, charged them, and made the whole prisoners.\n\nOn the 18th of December, Sir John's head-quarters were at Castro Nuevo, and Sir David Baird's at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVENTE\">Benevente</a>, on the road to join him. On the 20th Sir John reached Majorga, where he was joined by Sir David Baird. The united British army now amounted to rather fewer than 26,000 men, of whom about 2000 were cavalry. The weather was extremely cold, and the ground covered with deep snow. Still the exertions of the troops were indefatigable, and the cavalry in particular attacked and defeated a considerable body of French horse. On the 21st the army reached Sahagun, where Sir John established his head-quarters, and determined to halt for some time, to refresh his troops, after the fatigues which they had undergone.\n\nSir John had now arrived within a very short distance from Saldana, where the duke of Dalmatia was posted, with the flower of the French army; and preparations were made for an attack, which was waited for with all the ardour and impatience which distinguish British troops. In the meantime, however, repeated couriers arrived at head-quarters, the bearers of unpleasant intelligence. Certain information was received, that a strong French reinforcement had arrived at Carrion, a little to the right of Sahagun, that the French corps, which was marching to the south, had halted at Talavera, and that the enemy were advancing from Madrid in considerable force. Sir John now saw that his motions had been watched by Bonaparte, and that all the arts of this experienced general had been preparing to entrap him. To advance was madness; to retreat, almost in the face of an enemy, was a measure of the utmost danger, but it was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a>.\n\nOn the 24th of December Sir John began silently his retreat, and secretly to prepare for his retreat, and to provide, as far as possible, for the defence of those parts of the country.\ncountry which were still held by the patriots. With this latter view, he directed Sir David Baird to take the route towards Valencia de Don Juan, while the rest of the army was to proceed by Castro Gonzalo. By this division the magazines and stores which had been deposited at Benevente and Zamora, were also effectually secured.\n\nAccording to the arrangement made, General Frazer, followed by General Hope, marched with their divisions on the 24th December to Valderos and Majorga, and Sir David Baird proceeded with his to Valencia. To conceal this movement, Lord Paget was ordered to push on strong patrols of cavalry close to the advanced posts of the enemy. The reserve, with two light corps, did not retire from Sabagun till the morning of the 25th, following General Hope. Lord Paget was ordered to remain with the cavalry until evening, and then follow the reserve. These last were accompanied by Sir John. The retreat commenced in this deliberate manner. On the 26th of December, Sir David Baird reached the Eslar, and passed the ferry with less difficulty than was expected. He took post, according to his orders, at Valencia, and wrote to the marquis of Romana, urging him to blow up the bridge of Manilla. The other divisions of infantry proceeded unmolested to Castro Gonzalo. On the 24th the advanced guard of Bonaparte's army marched from Torrefellas, 120 miles from Madrid, and strong detachments of cavalry had been pushed forward to Villapando and Majorga. On the 26th, Lord Paget fell in with one of these detachments at the latter place. His lordship immediately ordered Colonel Leigh, with two squadrons of the 10th hussars, to attack this corps, which had halted on the summit of a steep hill. One of Colonel Leigh's squadrons was kept in reserve; the other rode briskly up the hill; on approaching the top, where the ground was rugged, the colonel judiciously reined-in to refresh the horses, though exposed to a severe fire from the enemy. When he had nearly gained the summit, and the horses had recovered their breath, he charged boldly and overthrew the enemy; many of whom were killed and wounded, and above 100 surrendered prisoners. Nothing could exceed the coolness and gallantry displayed by the British cavalry on this occasion. The 18th dragoons had signalized themselves in several former skirmishes; they were successful in five different attacks. Captain Jones, when at Palencia, had even ventured to charge 100 French dragoons with only 30 British; 14 of the enemy were killed, and six taken prisoners. The cavalry, the horse-artillery, and a light corps, remained on the night of the 26th, at Castro Gonzalo; and the divisions under Generals Hope and Frazer marched to Benevente. On the 27th, the rear guard crossed the Eslar, and followed the same route, after completely blowing up the bridge.\n\nWe shall not attempt any farther detail of this dangerous and calamitous retreat, in which our army suffered extremely, from the fatigues of constant marching, from the badness of the weather, and even from the brutality of the Spaniards, in whose cause they had embarked. Before they reached Astorga, it was found necessary to divide the army. A body of 3000 men, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIGADIER\">Brigadier</a>-general Crawford, was detached on the road to Orense towards Vigo, while the main body, under the command of Sir John Moore, marched by Astorga and Lugo, on the road to Corunna. They left Astorga on the 30th of December, and on the 11th January came in sight of Corunna. The army had now reached the sea port from which they were to embark, but adverse winds had detained the transports, or the whole of the troops would have been speedily and safely on board. Only a few ships lay in the harbour, and in these some sick men and a few stragglers, under pretence of sickness, had immediately embarked.\n\nDuring the whole march from Sabagun to Corunna, closely followed by the British army was closely followed by the French, led by Bonaparte and the duke of Dalmatia; and the French, two armies were often so near each other, that the French patrols fell in, during the night, with the cavalry piquets of the British. The duke of Dalmatia had joined Bonaparte at Astorga, and had increased his force to nearly 70,000 men, while the whole force of the British did not exceed 26,000. When Sir John's army reached Lugo, it was found that three divisions of the French were arranged in front, and it was thought advisable, on the 8th of January, to offer the enemy battle. This offer, however, the French thought proper to decline, and the duke of Dalmatia stirred not from his post. When the army reached Corunna, the French were far in the rear, and it was hoped that the transports might arrive before the enemy could come up.\n\nThe retreat of the British, considering the circumstances under which it was effected, was a brilliant and successful achievement. Two hundred and fifty miles of country had been traversed in 11 days, during the worst season of the year, through bad roads, over mountains, defiles, and rivers, and in almost daily contact with an enemy nearly three times their numbers. Though often engaged, the rear guard of the British had never been beaten, nor even thrown into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. Many losses had indeed been sustained, in baggage, artillery, and horses, and many stragglers had fallen into the hands of the enemy; but neither Napoleon nor the duke of Dalmatia could boast of a single military trophy taken from the retreating army. The greatest danger was still to be incurred; the position of Corunna was found to be extremely unfavourable; the transports had not arrived, and the enemy began to appear upon the heights. The situation of the army was by most of the officers thought so desperate, that they advised the general to propose terms to the duke of Dalmatia, that they might be suffered to embark unmolested; but this advice Sir John, without hesitation, rejected.\n\nOn the 12th of January, the French were seen moving in considerable force on the opposite side of the river Mero. They took up a position near the village of Perillo, on the left flank of the British, and occupied the houses along the river. In the mean time Sir John was incessantly occupied in preparing for the defence of his post, and in making every arrangement for the embarkation of the troops.\n\nOn the 13th, Sir David Baird marched out of Corunna with his division, and took post on a rising ground, where he determined to remain all night. A division under General Hope was sent to occupy a hill on the left, which commanded the road to Betanzos, forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> with Sir David Baird's division on the right. General Frazer's division was drawn up near the road to Vigo, about half a mile from Corunna, and communicated\ncommunicated with that under Sir David Baird, by means of the rifle corps attached to the latter, which formed a chain across the valley. The reserve under Major-general Paget occupied a village on the Betanzos road, about half a mile from the rear of General Hope. The higher grounds on the rear and flanks of the British were policed by the French, a situation which gave the latter a considerable advantage.\n\nIn the evening the transports from Vigo hove in sight; but the enemy was now so near, and had, during this day, thrown so much disposition to molest the British, that a general action became inevitable. On the 15th, the enemy had advanced to a height where, the day before, a magazine, containing nearly 4000 barrels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, had been blown up, and which was immediately opposite to the position of the British. On this day some skirmishes took place.\n\nOn the 16th, everything was prepared for a general action. Most of the artillery had been embarked, as it was found that, from the nature of the ground, much artillery could not be employed with advantage. During the 13th and 14th, the sick, the dismounted cavalry and horses, were also nearly all embarked. On the morning of the 16th, the French on the hills were apparently quiet, and it was hoped that the embarkation might be effected in the course of that night; but about noon the enemy, who had in the morning received reinforcements, and had placed some guns in front of the right and left of his line, was observed to be getting under arms, to be moving troops towards his left flank, and forming various columns of attack at that extremity of the strong and commanding position which he had taken on the 15th, in front of the British line. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of his intention was immediately succeeded by a rapid and determined attack on the division under Sir David Baird, which formed the right wing, and was the weakest part of the line. The first effort of the enemy was met by Sir John Moore and Sir David Baird at the head of the 42nd regiment, and the brigade under Lord William Bentinck. The village on the right became an object of oblate contest. While leading on his division to support this position, Sir David had his arm shattered with a grape shot.\n\nNot long after, while Sir John Moore was riding from post to post, everywhere encouraging his troops, and pointing out the most advantageous opportunities for attack or defence, his conspicuous situation had exposed him to the fire of the enemy. A cannon-ball struck his left shoulder, and beat him to the ground. He raised himself, and sat up with an unaltered countenance, looking intently at the Highlanders, who were warmly engaged. Captain Hardinge threw himself from his horse, and took him by the hand; then, observing his anxiety, he told him the 42nd were advancing, upon which his countenance immediately brightened. His friend Colonel Graham now dismounted to assist him; and, from the composure of his features, entertained hopes that he was not even wounded; but observing the horrid laceration and effusion of blood, he rode off for surgeons. The general was carried from the field on a blanket, by a sergeant of the 42nd, and some soldiers. On the way he ordered Captain Hardinge to report his wound to General Hope, who assumed the command. Many of the soldiers knew that their two chiefs were carried off; yet they continued to fight with undiminished courage; and, by the most determined bravery, not only repelled every attempt of the enemy to gain ground, but actually forced him to retire, though he had brought up fresh troops in support of those originally engaged.\n\nThe enemy finding himself foiled, in every attempt to force the right of the position, endeavoured by numbers to turn it. A judicious and well-timed movement, which was made by Major-general Paget, with the reserve, which corps had moved out of its cantonments to support the right of the army, by a vigorous attack, defeated this intention. The major-general having pushed forward the 95th (rifle corps) and 1st battalion 52nd regiment, drove the enemy before him; and, in his rapid and judicious advance, threatened the left of the enemy's position. This circumstance, with the position of Lieutenant-general Frazer's division (calculated to give still farther security to the right of the line) induced the enemy to relax his efforts in that quarter. They were, however, more forcibly directed towards the centre, where they were again successfully resisted by the brigade under Major-general Manningham, forming the left of Sir David Baird's division, and a part of that under Major-general Leith, forming the right of the division under General Hope. Upon the left the enemy at first contented himself with an attack upon our pickets, which, however, in general, maintained their ground. Finding, however, his efforts unavailing on the right and centre, he seemed determined to render the attack on the left more serious, and had succeeded in obtaining possession of the village through which the great road to Madrid passes, and which was situated in front of that part of the line. From this point, however, he was soon expelled with considerable loss, by a gallant attack of some companies of the 2nd battalion of the 14th regiment, under Lieutenant-colonel Nicholls. Before five in the evening, the British had not only successfully repelled every attack made upon the position, but had gained ground in almost all points, and occupied a more forward line than at the commencement of the action, whilst the enemy confined his operations to a cannonade, and the fire of his light troops, with a view to draw off his other corps. At six the firing ceased. The different brigades were reassembled on the ground which they occupied in the morning, and the pickets and advanced posts resumed their original stations.\n\nNotwithstanding the decided and marked superiority which at this moment the gallantry of the troops had given them over an enemy, who, from his numbers and the commanding advantages of his position, no doubt expected an easy victory, General Hope did not, on reviewing all circumstances, conceive that he should be warranted in departing from what he knew was the previous and fixed determination of the late commander of the forces, to withdraw the army on the evening of the 16th, for the purpose of embarkation, the previous arrangements for which had already been made by his order, and were in fact far advanced at the commencement of the action. The troops quitted their position about 10 at night, with a degree of order that did them credit. The artillery that remained unembarked, having been withdrawn, the troops followed in the order prescribed, and marched to their respective points of embarkation in the town and neighbourhood of Corunna. The pickets remained at their posts till five in the\nthe morning of the 17th, when they were also withdrawn with similar order, and without the movement having been discovered by the enemy.\n\nBy the unremitting exertion of the captains of the royal navy, who had been entrusted with the service of embarking the army, and in consequence of the arrangements made by the agents for transports, the whole of the forces were embarked with an expedition which has been seldom equalled. The brigades under Major-generals Hill and Beresford were destined to remain till daylight, in order to watch the movements of the enemy. The brigade under General Beresford, which was alternately to form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-guard</a>, occupied the land in front of Corunna, while that under General Hill was stationed on the promontory in the rear of the town by way of reserve.\n\nThe enemy pushed his light troops towards the town, soon after eight o'clock in the morning of the 17th, and shortly after occupied the heights of St Lucia, which commanded the harbour. But notwithstanding this circumstance, and the manifold defects of the place, there being no apprehension that the rear-guard could be forced, and the disposition of the Spaniards appearing to be good, the embarkation of Major-general Hill's brigade was commenced and completed by three in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>. After having fully explained, to the satisfaction of the Spanish governor, the nature of the movement, and having made every previous arrangement, General Beresford withdrew his corps from the land in front of the town soon after dark, and was, with all the wounded that had not previously been removed, safely embarked before one o'clock of the morning of the 18th.\n\nIn this action the British troops had come off with glory, and there can be no doubt, from the repulse of the French forces, and their subsequent inactivity, that the honour of the victory belonged to the British. The victory had indeed cost them dear. They had lost one of their best generals; and probably nearly 1000 men had been killed or wounded during the action. It had been achieved at the termination of a long and harassing service. The superior numbers, and advantageous position of the enemy, not less than the actual situation of the British army, did not admit of any advantage being reaped from success. The lustre of the British arms had, however, been maintained under the most disadvantageous circumstances. The army which had entered Spain amidst the fairest prospects, had no sooner completed its junction, than owing to the multiplied difficulties that dispersed the native armies around it, it was left to its own resources. The advance of the British troops from the Douro afforded the best hope, that the south of Spain might be relieved; but this generous effort to save an unfortunate people, also afforded the enemy the opportunity of directing every effort of his numerous troops, and concentrating all his principal resources for the destruction of the only regular force in the north of Spain. These circumstances had produced the necessity of rapid and harassing marches, which had diminished the numbers, exhausted the strength, and impaired the equipment of the army. Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, and those more immediately attached to a defensive position, which the imperious necessity of covering the harbour of Corunna, for a time, had rendered indispensible to assume, the native and un-\n\ndaunted valour of British troops was never more conspicuous.\n\nAt daybreak on the 18th, the English convoy was under sail, and on the 19th it had entirely left the Spanish coasts.\n\nNotwithstanding the ill success which had thus extended the expedition under Sir John Moore, the spirit of patriotism which appeared still to animate the southern provinces of Spain, and the hope that the common cause might there be supported to greater advantage, induced the British ministry to send another military force to the western peninsula of Europe, to co-operate with the patriots who still continued in arms. Accordingly, a body of about 15,000 forces, under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley, whose bravery and good conduct in the battle of Vimiera, had recommended him, in a particular manner, both to the ministry and the nation, was dispatched towards the coast of Portugal, where Marshal Beresford still maintained a British force; while General Hill, with about 5000 infantry, and 400 cavalry, sailed from Ireland with the same destination. General Hill arrived at Lisbon on the 4th of April, and soon after Sir Arthur landed with the main body. On the 7th of April the army moved forward towards the Douro, and crossed that river during the night of the 11th, a little above Oporto. Here they fell in with a French detachment from the army of the duke of Dalmatia, which they routed and put to flight, after a short but well-contested action.\n\nAfter this action the duke of Dalmatia found it necessary to retreat. He passed through the defiles of Salamanca, and thus gained considerably on the British army, though he was obliged to leave behind him part of his artillery. On the 19th of May he was at Allariz, and on the 20th he continued his retreat across the Minho, which he passed at Orense, thus leaving Portugal once more in possession of the British forces.\n\nSir Arthur Wellesley, after having remained for some time in the Portuguese territory, to refresh his men after the fatigues which they had undergone, advanced into Spain, and effected a junction with General Cuesta, who then commanded a considerable part of the remains of the patriotic army. In the latter end of July, the allied army had advanced to Talavera de la Reyna, in the neighbourhood of which they were encountered by a formidable French force, consisting of a corps commanded by Marshal Victor, another under General Sebastiani, the guards of Joseph Bonaparte, amounting to 8000 men, and the garrison of Madrid. This large force was commanded by Joseph Bonaparte in person, assisted by Marshals Jourdan and Victor, and General Sebastiani.\n\nOn the 27th of July, an attack was made by the French army on that of the allies, who had taken up Talavera. Their position at Talavera. The attack was vigorous, but was repelled with great spirit and success, though not without considerable loss on the part of the British.\n\nThe defeat of this attempt was followed about noon of the 28th by a general attack of the enemy's whole force, on the whole of that part of the position which was occupied by the British army. The general attack began by the march of several columns of infantry into the valley, with a view to attack the height occupied by\nSpain by Major-general Hill. These columns were immediately charged by the 1st German light dragoons, and the 23rd dragoons, under the command of General Anlon, and supported by General Fane's brigade of heavy artillery; and although the 23rd dragoons suffered considerable loss, the charge had the effect of preventing the execution of that part of the enemy's plan. At the same time an attack was directed upon Brigadier-general Alexander Campbell's position in the centre of the combined armies, and on the right of the British. This attack was most successfully repulsed by Brigadier-general Campbell, supported by the king's regiment of Spanish cavalry, and two battalions of Spanish infantry; and the allies were left in possession of the enemy's cannon.\n\nAn attack was also made at the same time on Lieutenant-general Sherbrooke's division, which was on the left and centre of the first line of the British army. This attack was most gallantly repulsed by a charge with bayonets, by the whole division; but the brigade of guards which were on the right, having advanced too far, were exposed on their left flank to the fire of the enemy's battery, and of their retiring columns; and the division was obliged to retire towards the original position, under cover of the second line of General Cotton's brigade of cavalry, which had moved from the centre, and the 1st battalion 43rd regiment. This regiment was removed from its original position on the heights, as soon as the advance of the guards was perceived, and formed in the plain; it advanced upon the enemy, and covered the formation of Lieutenant-general Sherbrooke's division. Shortly after the repulse of this general attack, in which apparently all the enemy's troops were employed, he commenced his retreat across the Alberche, which was conducted in the most regular manner, and effected during the night, leaving in the hands of the British 25 pieces of cannon, ammunition, tumbrils, and some prisoners.\n\nThough the French were defeated in this engagement, and, according to Sir Arthur Wellesley's account, must have lost at least 10,000 men, the loss of the British was very great. By the official returns it is stated to exceed 5000, namely, in killed, 34 officers, 28 sergeants, 2 drummers, and 735 rank and file; in wounded 195 officers, 165 sergeants, 16 drummers, and 3537 rank and file; and in missing 9 officers, 15 sergeants, 9 drummers, and 620 rank and file. The action, though brilliant, does not appear to have been attended with much advantage to the allies, as, from the reinforcements which the French army was daily receiving, Sir Arthur Wellesley (now Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-WELLINGTON\">Wellington</a>) was soon compelled to fall back towards the frontiers of Portugal, leaving behind him much of his baggage, and the whole of his sick and wounded. It must be recorded to the honour of the French commander, into whose hands these unfortunate men had fallen, that, in consequence of a representation in their favour by Lord Wellington, he treated them with the utmost humanity, and afforded them every accommodation which the nature of their situation admitted.\n\nSince the battle of Talavera, nothing of importance has transpired respecting the state of affairs in Spain. It appears that the patriots still continue to make a stand against their invaders; but it cannot be expected that their opposition shall be ultimately attended with success. The resources of the French are so numerous and extensive, and the force which he is able to draw towards the Spanish peninsula, has been so much increased in consequence of the peace lately concluded between France and Austria, that the liberties of Spain must, we fear, fall a sacrifice, and that kingdom must contribute to swell the already exorbitant power of the house of Bonaparte.\n\nWe shall conclude the historical part of this article with a summary recapitulation of the principal revolutions which have taken place in Spain.\n\nFrom the year 240 B.C. to the year 206 B.C., Spain was in some degree under the dominion of the Carthaginians. From the year 206 B.C. to the commencement of the fifth century of the Christian era, it continued almost entirely in possession of the Romans. The Goths reigned in Spain from the year 411 to 711; the Moors from the year 711 till 716, in part of the Asturias; till 820 in Catalonia; till 750 in Sobrarbe; till 923 in Leon; till 1073 in different parts of the two Caltiles; till 1118 in Aragon; till 1236 in Cordova and Jaen; till 1248 in Seville; till 1264 in the kingdom of Valencia; till 1265 in that of Murcia; and even so late as 1492 in Granada. During the wars against the Moors, the Goths reigned in the Asturias, Galicia, and, finally, in the kingdom of Leon till 1038.\n\nThe house of Navarre, descended from the French house of Bigorre, which had previously reigned in Castile for 10 years, united with it the crown of Leon till the year 1126. This was succeeded by the family of Bourbon, descended from the royal family of France, which reigned over these countries till 1555. The house of Charlemagne, a French family descended from that prince, ruled over Catalonia from the year 802 till 1132. The French family of Bigorre first reigned in Sobrarbe, and afterwards in Aragon, from the year 750 to 1162; at that period the French family of Barcelona succeeded to the government, and united to the crown of Aragon that of Catalonia, and afterwards the kingdom of Valencia, over which it reigned till the year 1430. These parts of Spain then came into the possession of the princes of the French branch of Navarre, which reigned in Castile, and continued in their descendants to 1515; at which time the different states of the Spanish monarchy were united under the government of Joanna the Foolish, who reigned over them till her death, which happened in 1555. The Austrian family then possessed the throne till 1700, since which time it has been occupied by a branch of the house of Bourbon, till the late revolution, by placing the Spanish monarchs in the power of the French, has given rise to a new dynasty of princes in the person of Joseph Bonaparte.\n\nThe earliest Spanish antiquities which can be with certainty ascertained, belong to the Roman period; and of these the examples are extremely numerous. They abound in the provinces of Catalonia, Valencia, and those which border on the Pyrenees. We cannot here enumerate, much less describe, all the remains of Roman antiquity mentioned by Swinburne, Townend, De Laborde, and other travellers in Spain. The most remarkable are, the aqueduct at Segovia, in Old Castile, consisting of 159 arches, extending about 742 yards, and being at least 94 feet high, where it crosses the valley; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a> of the ancient Soguntum, near\nthe modern Morviedro in Valencia, which was hewn out of the solid rock, and appears to have been capable of containing 10,000 spectators; a superb Roman arch, supported by Corinthian pillars, and having a very lofty gateway, not far from Tarragona; a monument near the same place, supposed to be the tomb of the father and uncle of Scipio Africanus; and a considerable amphitheatre on an eminence near Seville. It is supposed that the ancient city of Italica, built by Scipio Africanus for the reception of his wounded soldiers, stood near this spot; but we are assured by Mr Swinburne, that no traces of it now remain.\n\nOf the Gothic edifices, no certain remains are to be found; but the Moorish antiquities are numerous and splendid. Of these, the most remarkable are the palace of the Alhambra in the city of Granada, and the mosque of Cordova. Of the former we have already given an account under Alhambra. The mosque, now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Cordova, was begun by Abdoulrahman I. caliph of Cordova, and is computed to contain not fewer than 800 columns. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> of its doors, windows, and arches, especially those of the chapel of the Koran, at least equals that of the Alhambra in grandeur of design, and beauty of execution, and exceeds that palace in variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a>. This superb edifice has been minutely described by Mr Swinburne, in his travels into Spain, Letter 35. Not far from Cordova stood the magnificent city of Zehra, built by Abdoulrahman III. and which is said to have employed 25 years in building, and to have cost more than 2,500,000l. of our present sterling money. In this city was a palace containing 1173 columns, of African, Spanish, Italian, and Asiatic marbles. This splendid palace, and the city in which it stood, were entirely destroyed during the wars by which Spain was desolated in the middle ages.\n\nIt has been computed, that under the dominion of the Romans, Spain contained a population of nearly 50,000,000 of people; but this calculation is, by De Laborde, diminished to 22,000,000.\n\nAt the close of the 14th century, the population is stated by most Spanish writers as follows.\n\n| In the states of Castile | 11,000,000 |\n|--------------------------|------------|\n| States of Aragon         | 7,700,000  |\n| Kingdom of Granada       | 3,000,000  |\n|                          | 21,700,000 |\n\nOn what De Laborde deems better authority, he reduces this number to 16,000,000.\n\nIn the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, at the end of the 15th century, the total population of Spain has generally been estimated at 20,000,000, but this too is reduced by Laborde to 14,000,000 or 15,000,000.\n\nThe population was reduced\n\n- In 1688 to - - - - 10,000,000\n- 1700 - - - - 8,000,000\n- 1715 - - - - 6,000,000\n\nAccording to the table of the provinces, collected chiefly from De Laborde, it amounted, at the end of the 18th century, to 10,308,505; by the last census, taken in the years 1797 and 1798, the statements of which have not been published, but were lately locked up in the office belonging to the minister of finance, it appears that the population, at the end of the 18th century, exceeded 12,000,000.\n\nFrom these statements we observe, that the population of Spain had gradually diminished from its conquest by the Romans, to the reign of Philip V. in the beginning of the 18th century; but that during the last hundred years it has rapidly increased.\n\nVarious causes have been assigned for the remarkable depopulation that had taken place in the Spanish dominions. Perhaps the following by Dr Playfair are sufficiently plausible. \"The pestilential fevers and epidemic diseases, which carried off one-third of the inhabitants in the year 1347, and have produced great mortality during the two last centuries; almost incessant struggles for dominion, from 714 till the conquest of Granada, and union of the two crowns of Castile and Aragon; the expulsion of about 400,000 Jews by Ferdinand and Isabella, and of 900,000 Moors, A.D. 1610; the discovery of South America in 1493, which has gradually drained the country of its inhabitants and its industry; the calamities of war, during two centuries, from the accession of the emperor Charles V.; the form of government, and national prejudices, which discourage foreigners from settling in the kingdom, and are inimical to manufactures, commerce, and agriculture; the debauchery that prevails among all ranks; the great number of convents; the celibacy of the clergy; religious oppression, and numerous festivals, which lessen the number of working days, and so abridge the labour of the people.\"\n\nOf the number above stated, the clergy are reckoned at least 147,722: viz. of secular clergy, 60,240; of monks 49,270; of nuns and friars, 22,337; and of subaltern ministers of the church, 15,875. The numbers of the clergy have indeed diminished by more than 27,000, during the last 30 years of the 18th century, as in the year 1768 they amounted to 176,557.\n\nAccording to a calculation in the year 1776, the cities, towns, villages, and hamlets, amounted to 84,459 (D); towns, villages, &c., and public edifices and temples to 30,496.\n\nIt appears that there exist in Spain 2,628,557 individuals of both sexes, who do not contribute, or at least are not supposed to contribute, to the population. From this view, and the progress we have already stated, it will be easy to discover, by comparative calculations with the detailed statements of population in other countries, the proportionate number of births, deaths, marriages, &c., which annually take place in Spain.\n\nThe Spanish government, which was of a limited nature, during the dynasties of the kings of Castile and Aragon, afterwards became an absolute monarchy. At that\n\n(D) In the year 1788, the number of villages was estimated at 19,219; and that of parishes at 20,080.\nthat period the royal prerogative was confined both by the express tenor of the laws and the forms of their administration. The peculiar privileges of the two states of Castile and Aragon continued to exist long after their reunion; but the royal authority was constantly taking umbrage at their exercise. The princes of the Austrian family did not openly attack them, but had recourse to the more effectual method of secretly undermining them; and thus they were so far diminished, that at the close of the 17th century they amounted to little more than mere forms. The attachment of Aragon to the cause of the archduke Charles, induced the first sovereign of the royal family of France to abolish them entirely. Philip V., having subdued Aragon, supprest the states-general, the last meeting having been held at Zaragoza in the year 1720, on which occasion Queen Isabella of Savoy presided in the absence of her husband, who was at that time in Italy. Since that period no further power is left the Cortes of Castile and Aragon, but the privilege of nominating deputies to the states-general of the kingdom, whenever they are summoned by the monarch.\n\nThe whole authority, previous to the late revolution, centred in the king and his ministers; the national affairs were conducted by the different councils, appointed by the crown, which deliberated and formed their plans in the capital. Some of these possessed both legislative and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a>, and exercised the double function of advising the king and administering justice. The council of Castile, in this distribution of power, was paramount; its decrees being decisive in the courts, but its judgements were under the control of the king. The resolutions were transmitted to the monarch by a certain number of members, under the title of the Chamber of Castile, whose influence was prodigiously great. This council was so denominated, because the members chosen by the king formerly co-operated with ministers in expediting the affairs of state in the royal chamber, and for this purpose they attended the court wherever it was held.\n\nBesides the council of Castile, there was the royal and supreme council of the Indies, invested with the same powers, and exercising similar functions with respect to the American colonies, as the council of Castile with respect to the European territory.\n\nIt is not easy to ascertain the amount of the revenues under the late government. They arose from a tax on imports and exports; from the chief objects of internal consumption; from the monopolies of the crown; from landed estates; from tithes of church and abbey lands; from the sale of indulgences; and from the trade with the American colonies. Their total amount has been variously stated. M. Jordan has computed it to exceed 7,000,000l. sterling; by M. De Laborde, the revenues for the European continent alone, are calculated to exceed 8,000,000l. sterling.\n\nIt would be absurd to attempt any estimate of the military strength of Spain in its present state of disorganization and confusion. During the latter part of the 18th century, the land forces in time of peace seldom exceeded 50,000 ill-disciplined troops; but in time of war, the army was capable of being augmented to a formidable force. In the year 1798 the standing forces of the Spanish monarchy amounted to 100,000 effective men.\n\nTill of late the Spanish navy was highly respectable, both as to strength and discipline. In the year 1778 the Spanish fleet consisted of 143 vessels of all descriptions; and of these more than 60 were ships of the line. In 1788, the number of ships of the line amounted to 68, and that of large frigates to 47. In the present long contest among the powers of Europe, the navy of Spain has been greatly diminished; and the only fleet of any importance now existing is that in the harbour of Cadiz.\n\nThere are in Spain several orders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>, or Orders as they are called, military orders. The principal order of knighthood is that of the Golden Fleece, instituted in the year 1430, by Duke Philip the Good. The order of St Jago di Compostella was instituted by Ferdinand II., in the year 1175, and its badge is a red uniform cross in twelve departments. The order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALATRAVA\">Calatrava</a>, instituted by Sancho III. of Castile, has for its badge a red cross in five departments. The order of Alcantara was instituted by Ferdinand II.; and its badge is a lily placed crossways. The order of Montesa, instituted in the year 1317, by James III. king of Aragon, is composed of 19 commanderies.\n\nThe money of Spain is either real or imaginary, the former serving for the purpose of exchange, the latter for keeping accounts and transacting business. Both these are common throughout the whole kingdom; but several kinds of both are to be found in the different provinces.\n\nTwo kinds of real money, both in gold and silver, are distinguished in Spain; the old, that is, such as were coined before the year 1772, and those coined subsequent to that period. None of the former are uniform, but consist of small pieces of different sizes unequally cut, and their currency is only by weight. The latter uniformly bear the head of the sovereign on the obverse, and on the reverse side the arms of Spain; the ancient gold coins are more intrinsically valuable than the modern. The last only will be here described.\n\n**Modern Gold Coins.**\n\n| Coins                  | Value in Sterling money |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Durito                |                         |\n| Escudo chico de oro   | 4s. 2d.

De Laborde's tables; in which their value is estimated in money tournois, computing the livre tournois at 10d. sterling, and the sol at \u00bdd. sterling.\nModern Silver Coins.\n\n| Coins                  | Value in sterling money |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Real                  |                         |\n| Real de vellon        | 2\u00bdd.                    |\n| Medio real de plata   |                         |\n| Real de plata         | 5d.                     |\n| Media pecata          |                         |\n| Real de a dos         | 10d.                    |\n| Escudo                |                         |\n| Medio duro            | 2s. 1d.                 |\n| Duro                  |                         |\n| Pezoduro              | 4s. 2d.                 |\n| Real de a ocho        |                         |\n\nThe Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and measures</a> vary considerably in different parts of the kingdom, as almost every province has both peculiar to itself. The pound generally consists of 16 ounces in that part of the kingdom formerly belonging to the crown of Castile, and of 12 ounces in those annexed to the crown of Aragon; viz. in Aragon, in the kingdom of Valencia, and in Catalonia; but the ounce is not the same. We shall here only particularize the weights of Castile.\n\nIn the Castiles they reckon by charges, quintals, arobas, arredles, pounds, ounces, and drams. The following table gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> value of the Castilian weights.\n\n| The charge contains | lb. oz. |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| quintal            | 3      |\n| aroba              | 4      |\n| arredle            | 25     |\n| pound              | 4      |\n| ounce              | 16     |\n| dram               | 16     |\n| grain              | 30     |\n\nThe measures are still more complicated than the weights; and especially the measures of capacity, will require to be considered rather more in detail. We shall, as usual, distinguish them into long measure, superficial or land measure, and measures of capacity.\n\nLong measure.\u2014The standard lineal measure in Spain is the royal foot, consisting of 153.47 lines; and bearing to the English foot the proportion of about 153 to 144, or of 17 to 16. This foot, however, is not in general use, almost every province having its own foot, which is generally rather less than the royal foot. Thus, the foot in Castile is 8 lines less, and that of Valencia about 9\u00bd lines less than the standard.\n\nOf royal feet 100 are equivalent to 102 feet 7 inches of Catalonia, to 107 feet of Valencia, to 115 feet 10 inches and 4 lines of Castile.\n\nOne hundred feet of Catalonia are equal to 92 feet 2 inches 3 lines of the royal foot, to 97 feet 5\u00bd lines of Valencia, and 104 feet 11 inches 11 lines of Castile.\n\nIn Valencia 100 feet are equivalent to 93 feet 4 inches 10 lines of the royal foot, to 98 feet 9 inches of Catalonia; and 107 feet 2 inches 6 lines of Castile.\n\nIn Castile, 100 feet are equal to 86 feet 1 inch 5 lines of the royal foot; to 93 feet 4 inches 9\u00bd lines of Valencia; and 92 feet 2 inches 3 lines of Catalonia.\n\nCloths and stuffs in Catalonia are measured by canas, in other parts of the kingdom by varas; the cana is divided into 8 pams, the vara into four. The proportions which these bear to the royal foot will be seen from the following table:\n\n| Pam of Catalonia, | Feet Inches Lines |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| Cana of Catalonia,| 0 7 4             |\n| Six pams make the Paris ell, | 4 10 8 |\n| Pam of Castile, | 0 7 8             |\n| Vara of Castile, | 2 6 8             |\n| Pam of the kingdom of Valencia, | 2 9 4 |\n| Five pams and a little more than \u00bcth, or one vara one pam and a little more than \u00bcth, make a Paris ell. |\n| Pam of Aragon, | 0 6 7\u00bd           |\n| Vara of the Asturias, | 2 5 9             |\n| Vara of Aragon, | 2 5 9\u00bd           |\n| A little less than 6 pams, or one vara two pams, make a Paris ell. |\n| Pam of Galicia for linen drapery, | 0 9 2 |\n| Vara of Galicia for ditto, | 2 6 8             |\n\nLand Measure.\u2014Land in the provinces belonging to the crown of Castile is measured by ungadas, fanegas, efadales, braffes, varas, pas, and aranzadas. Of these the ungada contains 50 fanegas, about 204\u00be feet; the fanega 400 efadales = about 4\u00bd feet; the efadale two braffes = about ten feet; the braffes two varas, or about 5 feet 1 inch 4 lines; the pas about 1\u00bdd of a vara, and the aranzada about 73 varas. This last is only used for measuring vineyards.\n\nIn Biscay land is measured by carros, plazas, and celemines; and in Valencia by yugadas, calizadas, fanegas, braffes, and pams.\n\nMeasures of Capacity.\u2014Corn is measured in the provinces belonging to the crown of Castile by cahizas, fanegas, celemines, and quartillos; and in Biscay the same measures are used, with the exception of the cahiza. The cahiza contains 12 fanegas, and is = about 1\u00bd lb. French; the fanega contains 12 celemines = 124 lb.; the celemine 4 quartillos = 10lb. 5\u00bd ounces, and the quartillo = 2 lb. 7\u00bd ounces.\n\nIn Catalonia grain is measured by salmas, charges, quarteras, cortans, and picotas. The salma contains 2 charges or 6 quintals = 540lb.; the charge contains 2 quarteras or 3 quintals = 273lb.; and the cortan contains 4 picotas or 13 lb. of 12 oz. = 11 lb. 6 oz.; and the picota 3\u00bdlb. of 12 oz. = 2lb. 13\u00bd oz.\n\nThe measures for liquids vary exceedingly, according to the liquid they are intended to contain. Thus, at Madrid, honey is measured by arobas and quartillos, the quartillo being about 1\u00bd lbs. and the aroba containing 32 quartillos. Oil is measured in New Castile also by arobas and quartillos, but the quartillo is = 6\u00bd lbs.; and the aroba contains 4 quartillos, or 25 lbs. In Seville, oil is measured by the pipe and aroba, the pipe containing 34 arobas; while in Valencia it is measured by charges, arobas, and cantaros, the charge containing 12 arobas, and the cantaro equal 28 lbs. 1 oz.\n\nWine in New Castile is measured by moyos, an imaginary measure, cantaras, azumbres, quartillos, and lexarios.\nThe moyo contains 16 cantaras, the cantara 12 azumbres, the azumbre 4 quartillos, each equal to 1 lb. At Cadiz wine is measured by tonneaux, arobas, azumbres, and quartillos. The tonneau contains 30 arobas, the aroba 8 azumbres, the azumbre 4 quartillos, each of which is equal to 1 lb. 1 oz. At Seville the measures for wine are cantaras, azumbres, and quartillos. The cantara contains 8 azumbres, the aroba the same, the azumbre 4 quartillos, each of which is equal to 17 ounces.\n\nIn Valencia these measures are, botas or tonneaux, charges, arobas, or cantaras, and azumbres or cuentas; and in Catalonia, pipes, charges, quintals, arobas, quarteros, and quartos, of which the pipe contains 4 charges, the charge 3 quintals, the quintal 4 arobas, the aroba 22 quarteros, the quarto 4 quartos, and the quarto is equal to nearly 3 ounces of Catalan measure.\n\nThe laws of Spain, which for a long time varied greatly in the different states of the monarchy, are at present reduced to a considerable degree of uniformity. Navarre and Bilcay have retained their ancient laws and constitution; but the revolution which took place in Spain at the beginning of the 18th century, enabled Philip V. to introduce into Catalonia and the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia the laws of Castile; which, excepting a few alterations, rendered necessary by local peculiarities, still continue in full effect.\n\nThe laws of Castile, which are thus become those of almost all Spain, are contained in the codes known by the titles of the Fuero juzgo, Ley de las siete partidas, Ordenamiento real, Fuero real, and Recepcion; of these the last is a collection of occasional edicts of the kings of Spain, and enjoys the highest authority.\n\nThe Roman law has no validity in Spain, and though it may be studied by a few lawyers, as containing first principles universally applicable; yet it is never quoted in the courts, and is expressly excepted against by some of the old laws of Castile.\n\nThe conducting of a law suit in Spain is subject to very complicated forms; whence necessarily results a slowness of progress. The whole business is carried on by writers, a peculiar branch of the legal profession. In the superior tribunals, the management of causes is in like manner committed to a kind of subaltern magistrates, called reporters (relatores), who contrive to render their own department a situation of much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> than that of the judge.\n\nIn all the branches of civil, military, ecclesiastical, and judicial administration, in Spain, is evident a spirit of mildness and paternal indulgence, which often degenerates into great abuse. By multiplying courts for the administration of justice, and by establishing the long series of appeals from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, in order that each case may be heard and re-heard, and receive an equitable sentence, the still more important advantages of prompt decision are sacrificed, and a door is opened for chicanery.\n\nIt is universally acknowledged that the courts of exception are far too numerous; they enfeeble the authority of the established judges, and withdraw a number of individuals from the superintendence of magistrates who reside among them, and are readily accessible, to confine them to the care of dilatory and dilatory tribunals.\n\nA considerable degree of jealousy and opposition also subsists among many of the tribunals; hence they mutually weaken each other's authority, and the clients are configned over from court to court; so that lawsuits become intolerably protracted, and a family is held in suspense for two or three generations. The consequence of this is, that the rich wear out those of inferior fortune.\n\nEven the ordinary and regular forms of civil process are slow and complicated. The husbandman is called from his labour, the merchant from his commercial concerns, the artist from his work, and all from their domestic affairs. Nearly an equal tardiness takes place in criminal processes, so that witnesses die, and means of proof are lost, while the guilty often escape unpunished; and those who have been formally acquitted, are still subject to a long detention in prison, whence they are at length dismissed without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDEMNITY\">indemnity</a>, and irretrievably ruined.\n\nIn consequence of the great number of courts, the facility of appeal from one to the other, and the tediousness of law suits; the multitude of judges, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, writers, and other subordinate officers employed in the administration of justice is prodigious. The number of persons employed in the different law establishments has been estimated at 100,000, which is nearly an hundredth part of the population of the country; and the very last general enumeration of the inhabitants of Spain makes the number of advocates amount to 5675, and of writers to 9351; besides the judges and their secretaries, the attorneys and their clerks, and the innumerable host of alguazils and inferior officers.\n\nAnother serious inconvenience in the administration of Spanish law, is the necessity of repaying entire and blind confidence in a class of subaltern officers of the courts, called writers. This appears to be a branch of the profession wholly peculiar to Spain; the writer exercising at the same time the functions of secretary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLICITOR\">solicitor</a>, notifier, registrar, and being the sole medium of communication between the client and the judge.\n\nIt is not customary in Spain to allow either of the parties concerned any copy of the documents requisite for carrying on a suit, except by the express order of the judge. All the writings on both sides are collected together and bound up into a volume, which remains slavishly in the possession of the writer, who entrusts it for a certain time to the attorneys of the parties for the instruction of advocates. The writer, to whose care the documents of any suit are committed, also registers the decrees and sentences of the judges on the case, and notifies to the parties concerned, each step of the process, by reading to them the proper instrument; without, however, allowing them to have a copy of it.\n\nThe union of so many important functions in the same person, necessarily affords various opportunities for dishonesty; and the chance of being imposed upon is still further increased by an unwise regulation which obliges the defendant, in any action, to choose the same writer as is employed by the plaintiff.\n\nIt may be remarked that scarcely any other persons are under equal temptations to dishonesty on account of the almost total impunity that they enjoy in consequence of the following regulation. In all those districts where there are either a corregidor and superior alcade, or two superior alcades; each of these officers has an independent tribunal for the decision of law suits; and the right of pronouncing sentence in any particular case belongs to him of the two at whose tribunal the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>\nNow the established salaries of these officers are so small, that the largest part of their emoluments arises from their fees; this portion of their income depends wholly on the writers, who have the power of instituting suits in which of the two courts they please. The natural consequence is, that the judges are induced to overlook and pass by in silence those malpractices of the writers which they cannot prevent without incurring a serious personal loss. Finally, the authority of the writers is irrefragably established by the entire control that they execute over all causes. They alone receive the declarations and personal answers of the parties concerned; they alone receive the depositions of the witnesses on each side; put what questions to them they please; and record the answers without the interposition, and even in the absence, of the judges.\n\nAnother serious defect in the administration of justice in Spain, is, that the party condemned, however clearly unjust may have been his demand, or however weak may have been his defence, is scarcely ever obliged to pay his adversary's costs of suit; whence it perpetually happens, that the expenses of gaining a just cause are much greater than the loss of submitting to an unjust demand; hence also it is in the power of a rich villain to oppress and ruin all those who are unable to support the expenses of a law suit; which in Spain are enormous, and perhaps the more so, because the established charges are very light.\n\nThe religion of Spain is the Roman Catholic; which, in this country and Portugal, has been carried to a pitch of fanaticism unknown to the Italian states, or even in the papal territory. The inquisition, has in these unhappy kingdoms, been invested with exorbitant power, and has produced the most ruinous effects; having been formerly conducted with a spirit totally the reverse of the mildness and charity of Christianity. This evil has been recently subdued in a considerable degree; but one fanatic reign would suffice to revive it. A yet greater evil, which has sprung from fanaticism, is the destruction of morals; for the monks being extremely numerous, and human passions ever the same, those ascetics atone for the want of marriage by the practice of adultery; and the husbands, from dread of the inquisition, are constrained to connive at this enormous abuse. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> is feared by the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ABJURATION\">abjuration</a>, and the mind becomes reconciled to the strangest of all phenomena, theoretic piety and practical vice united in bonds almost indissoluble.\n\nAccording to the returns made to the government, the Spanish clergy then stood as follows:\n\n| Category                                      | Number |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Parochial clergy, called curas                | 16,689 |\n| Assistants, called tenientes curas             | 5,771  |\n| Sacristans or sextons                         | 10,873 |\n| Acolitos to assist at the altar               | 5,593  |\n| Ordinados de patrimonio, having a patrimony   | 13,244 |\n| of three rials per day                        |        |\n| Ordinados de menores, with inferior ecclesiastical orders | 10,774 |\n| Beneficiados, or canons of cathedrals, and other beneficiaries | 23,692 |\n| Monks                                         | 61,617 |\n\nCarry forward 148,163\n\nThe archbishoprics were eight in number; and the bishoprics 46. The most opulent see was that of Toledo, supposed to yield annually about 90,000l. The Mozarabic Missal, composed by St Ildefons for the Gothic church, after the conversion from Arianism to the Catholic faith, continued to be used in Spain till the Moors were subdued, when the Roman form was introduced.\n\nThe Spanish clergy, in proportion to the population of the country, is less numerous than was the clergy of state of France prior to the revolution; even their wealth is Spanish less considerable, but better administered; and their clergy-contribution to the public revenue is much greater. As to the general conduct of the Spanish church, and its influence on the state, we may remark that after all the perverted and malicious industry that has been exerted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of this question, the result has turned out highly favourable to the superior orders of the Spanish clergy, who are, for the most part, free from those irregularities which are charged on the clergy of other countries. The conspicuous situations in the Spanish church are by no means considered as the patronage of the rich and noble, but as the well-merited reward of irreproachable conduct. Whatever may be the rank of an ecclesiastic in the sacerdotal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a>, he never habitually absents himself from his proper place of residence, where he expends the revenue of his benefice in alms or public works. From the period of the reconquest of Spain from the Moors, most of the public establishments owe their foundation to the clergy, by whom also whole towns have been rebuilt and raised from their ruins. The most beautiful aqueducts, fountains, and public walks in the cities, have been constructed at the expense of their bishops; from them also the poor have received the most effectual relief in times of scarcity, epidemic disease, and war. The bishop of Orense converted his episcopal palace into an almshouse, where were lodged and supported 300 French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, condemned to transportation during the furies of the revolution; the prelate himself took his place at their table, and refused to partake of any indulgence that he could not also procure for his guests. Cardinal Orenzana, archbishop of Toledo, converted the alcazar of that city into an establishment wherein are received 200 children, and 700 poor persons of all ages. The bishop of Cordova, during the scarcity of 1804, and for a long time afterwards, made a daily distribution of 1200 rations of bread to the poor inhabitants of his diocese. The aqueduct which conveys water to the city of Tarragona is the work of their archbishop, who has thus conferred upon the place the inappreciable benefits of cleanliness and health; to both of which it was long a stranger. Similar instances of public merit may be found in almost every diocese.\n\nWith regard to the religious orders, their conduct is certainly less exemplary, though by no means meriting the reproaches that have been so liberally cast upon them.\nthem. The reforms that have taken place at various periods have stopped the progress of the abuses introduced by length of time; and as the numbers of the monks have diminished, their pernicious influence on public opinion has proportionally declined. Some progress has been made in the desirable policy of uniting the different orders of the same rule into a single order; and from the present prohibition to receive novices, it is probable that several orders are about to be totally suppressed.\n\nThe Spanish language is one of the great southern dialects which spring from the Roman; but many of the words become difficult to the French or Italian student, because they are derived from the Arabic used by the Moors. The speech is grave, sonorous, and of exquisite melody, containing much of the flow and formal manner of the orientals.\n\nThe Spanish language is, in some respects, very rich; it abounds in compound words, in superlatives, derivatives, augmentatives, diminutives, and frequentative verbs; it has many quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> words, and others which well express the different shades of meaning. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms of arts and sciences it is, however, extremely poor; a few of these it has borrowed from the Latin, and almost all the rest from the French.\n\nOn the whole, the Spanish is one of the finest of the European languages. It is dignified, harmonious, energetic, and expressive; and abounds in grand and florid expressions, which unite into measured periods, whose cadence is very agreeable to the ear. It is a language well adapted to poetry; but it also inclines to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>, and its vehemence easily degenerates into bombast. Though naturally grave, it easily admits of pleasantry. In the mouth of well educated men it is noble and expressive; lively and pointed in that of the common people; sweet, seductive, and persuasive, when uttered by a female. Amongst the orators it is touching and imposing, though rather diffuse; at the bar and in the schools it is barbarous, and is spoken about the court in a concise and agreeable manner.\n\nThe literature of Spain is highly reputable, though little known to the other countries of Europe since the decline of Spanish power. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIBLIOTHECA\">Bibliotheca</a> Hispanica of Antonio will completely satisfy the curious reader on this subject. Among the fathers of literature in this country must be named Isidore of Seville, many of whose works are extant, and inferior in merit to few of that epoch. Lives of saints, and chronicles, are also found among the earliest productions; and successive writers may be traced to the 11th century, when they become numerous; but before mentioning some Spanish authorities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to that period, it will be proper to recollect that Arabian learning flourished under the caliphs of Cordova, and produced many illustrious names well known to the oriental scholar, as Aben Roe, or Averroes, Aben Zoar, Rhazes, &c., nor must it be forgotten that Aben Nazan wrote a book on the learning and authors of Spain. On this subject the inquisitive are referred to the work of Cafriri.\n\nIn the 11th century, the Spanish authors began to increase in number, and the native language begins to appear. This was the epoch of the famous Cid, Roderic Didac de Bivar, whose actions against the Moors were celebrated in contemporary songs, and by a long poem written in the following century. After the 13th century, it would be idle to attempt enumerating all the Spanish authors, among whom are Alphonsus the Wise, who wrote the Libro del Terolfo, a treatise on the Three Parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>; and at whose command were compiled the famous Alphonse Tables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>. Raymond Lully is said to have written not fewer than 319 books, full of metaphysical froth. In the 15th century appeared Juan de Mena, a poet of surprising powers, since which time a department of literature can scarcely be mentioned in which the Spaniards have not excelled. It would be unnecessary to repeat the well-known names of Cervantes, Quevedo, Lopez de Vega, and others, whose works are known to all Europe. The history of Mexico has been celebrated as a composition; but in fact it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> and erroneous. The name of Bayer in learning, and of Feyjos in general knowledge, have recently attracted deserved respect; nor has the *Pinkerton* line of royal authors failed, an elegant translation of *Don Quixote* having been published by the heir apparent to the monarchy, the present Ferdinand VII.\n\nAs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> are in Spain generally imparted by the monks, it can scarcely be expected that useful knowledge should be common in that country. The accounts given on this subject by travellers, have thrown so little light on the state of education in Spain, that it can be generally understood only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with other Catholic countries. In this comparison Spain will be found inferior to France and Italy, but in many respects superior to Austria and the German states.\n\nThe number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> in Spain was formerly Universities, 24, but only the following 17 now remain, viz. that of Pamplona, in Navarre; of Oviedo, in the Asturias; of San Jago, in Galicia; of Seville, and of Granada, in the provinces of the same name; of Huesca and Zaragoza, in Aragon; of Avila, Olma, and Valladolid, in Old Castile; of Toledo, Siguenza, and Alcala de Henares, in New Castile; of Cervera, in Catalonia; of Orihuela and Valencia, in Valencia; and of Salamanca, in the province of Leon. Of these the most celebrated, are the universities of Zaragoza, Toledo, Alcala, Cervera, and Salamanca.\n\nThe university of Zaragoza has 22 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a>, and that of Toledo has 24; about 900 students attend the classes of the former, and nearly 3000 those of the latter; yet neither of these establishments is known in Europe, or regarded as of high reputation even in Spain.\n\nThe university of Alcala, established at a prodigious expense by Cardinal Ximenes, answered for nearly a century the views of its illustrious founder. This splendid institution consists of 31 general professors, and 13 colleges, each of which has its particular establishment of masters and professors, and of students, who receive gratuitous support and instruction. At present, however, this university is gone so entirely to decay, that scarcely a vestige of its ancient splendour remains, and the whole number of students scarcely amounts to 500.\n\nThe university of Cervera, founded at the commencement of the 18th century, with a magnificence truly royal, possesses 43 professors, five colleges, about 900 students; but it partakes of the radical fault of all the Spanish universities; the course of study is incomplete and antiquated, and the very name of the institution is scarcely known beyond the boundaries of Catalonia.\nThe university of Salamanca, the most ancient of any in Spain, has enjoyed a degree of celebrity which entitles it to a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\nIt was founded by Alfonso IX. between the years 1230 and 1244, and was considerably enlarged by Ferdinand III. his grandson. But its most magnificent patron was Alfonso X. surnamed the Wise, son and successor of the last mentioned sovereign. This prince richly endowed it, and drew up a set of statutes for its government. He established a professorship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>, with a salary of 500 maravedies; a professorship of canon law, with a salary of 300 maravedies; two professorships of decrets with salaries of 500 maravedies; two professors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a>, and as many of logic, with salaries of 200 maravedies each; and two masters of grammar, with salaries of 300 maravedies. It experienced also the liberality of many succeeding sovereigns, and received from the popes a vast extent of privileges.\n\nFor many years this university enjoyed a high reputation; its fame extended over all Europe; it was consulted by kings and by popes, and its deputies were received into the general councils, where they well sustained the character of the body which they represented. Students flocked to it not only from all the provinces of Spain and Portugal, and from the islands of Majorca and the Canaries, but also from the West Indies and New Spain, and even from France, Flanders, and England. The number of students who attended the classes amounted nearly to 15,000. The whole of this vast establishment consisted of 25 colleges, a library, and an hospital, called Del Estudio, intended for the amelioration of poor scholars.\n\nThe celebrity of Salamanca continued in full vigour during many ages; but, at length, as rival institutions sprang up, declined by slow degrees, so that by the year 1595, the number of students did not exceed 7000.\n\nAfter the evacuation of Spain by the Romans, theatrical representations were discontinued till they were restored by the Moors, and from them adopted by the Gothic Spaniards, who soon became passionately fond of the stage, a taste which they have ever since preserved.\n\nThey had at first neither theatres nor a stage, their dramas were acted in a court, a garden, or the open fields; the actors and spectators were mingled, and were equally exposed to the injuries of the weather.\n\nAt a subsequent period the stage was marked out by a kind of boarded platform, and was surrounded by old clothes, drawn back, on occasion, by means of cords, which formed the only decorations, and behind which the actors dressed. Their properties consisted only of crooks, some wigs and false beards, and a few white skins, trimmed with gold fringe.\n\nTheatrical exhibitions became more regular and decent towards the end of the 16th century, when a new form was given to them by the exertions of Bartholomew Naharro, a middling dramatic poet. Theatres were then erected, but the greatest part were upon trestles, and two parallel pieces of canvas formed their scenes, which were sometimes chequered with various colours, sometimes covered with miserable paintings, or adorned with foliage, trees, or flowers.\n\nDuring all these periods, the prompter, with a candle in his hand, stationed himself on the stage by the side of the performers who were speaking, and jumped from side to side whenever the actors changed their places.\n\nThis custom prevailed at the end of the 17th century, and even still prevails among the strolling companies of small towns.\n\nTheatres have at length, however, assumed a handsomer appearance in this country, and customs more conformable to the rest of Europe. Handsome theatres have been multiplied, and their stages are now well arranged and decorated; all the great cities are well provided with them, and many of the smaller towns may boast of elegant and not ill furnished playhouses.\n\nThe prompter no longer runs from one side of the stage to the other; he is placed in the middle before the scenes, in a kind of well, where he no longer offends the sight and taste of the spectator; but an old custom which is still observed, greatly injures the interest and effect of the representation. The prompter, who has the piece before him, does not wait till the actor is at a loss to prompt him, but recites the whole drama aloud, so that the actor appears to follow him in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>. By this means two voices are heard in the theatre pronouncing the same words, which are confounded, and often produce a discord, and the spectator who has first heard the piece recited, no longer takes an equal interest in the same verses, phrases, and words, which the actor afterwards declaims.\n\nThe Spanish theatres are divided into a patio, or area, and boxes called balco and gradas. The orchestra, where the musicians are stationed, adjoins the stage; an inclosure between it and the pit is let round with arm chairs, and destined for the reception of the higher class; the patio, or pit, is placed behind, and filled with benches, and the gradas consist of two rows of benches disposed amphitheatrically on each side below the boxes, and sometimes also across the lower end of the theatre. This last division is found only in a few theatres; in the others, the space beneath the boxes is empty, and persons stand in it. The patio and the gradas contain the common people, the most numerous, most noisy, and most impertinent part of the public.\n\nThere are commonly only two tiers of boxes, sometimes three; they extend on each side from the stage to the end of the theatre. The form is the usual one, but they are divided from each other by partitions, which completely shut them up on each side, a circumstance which greatly injures the beauty of the general effect.\n\nThere is commonly at the end of the theatre fronting the stage, a large box with seats placed semicircularly behind one another, which is called the cazuela. No man is allowed to enter it, and only women muffled up in their mantelas are admitted.\n\nThere are several things very singular and amusing in this cazuela. Women of every age and condition are there united; the married are confounded with the single; the wives of the common people with those of tradesmen and the ladies of the court; the poor woman with the rich one who would not be at the trouble of dressing to appear in her box. Their appearance is most curious; they are all covered with their mantelas, a kind of white or black veil, and give the idea of a choir of nuns. It is the place for chattering, and between the acts there proceeds from the cazuela a confused noise like the hum of bees, which afflicts and diverts all who hear it for the first time. Scarcely is the performance ended, when the door of this box, its galleries, passages, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAIRCASE\">staircase</a> leading to it, are all\nSpain all besieged by a great crowd of men of every condition; some attracted by curiosity; others coming to wait upon the women who are in it.\n\nNotwithstanding all that has been done for its improvement, the Spanish stage is still far from the celebrity which it once possessed; and the people do not lend the efforts of their best writers. The acting is in a still lower state. The performers possess neither that dignity which characterizes great personages, and ennobles a subject without injuring its interest; nor that sweet expression of voice and gesture which goes to the heart, and awakens the sentiments it expresses. In their acting everything is violent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a>; everything departs from nature. Their recitation is a feat of strength, and is performed at the sole expense of the lungs. Cries and shrieks are its most impressive part, and the most applauded by the majority of the audience. They put nothing in its proper place; all their action is exaggerated; when they threaten they roar; when they command they thunder; when they sigh, it is with an effort which completely exhausts the breath. They substitute anger for dignity, violence for spirit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> for gallantry. Their gestures rarely correspond with the sentiments they ought to express; but resemble their recitation; and are usually monotonous, capricious, ignoble, and almost always violent. The women, in their bursts of passion, become furies; warriors become villains; generals robbers; and heroes braves. Nothing, as they manage it, is pathetic; nothing makes any impression on the audience. The spectators, equally unmoved at the end of the piece, as at the beginning, see it, without having experienced a single moment of interest or emotion.\n\nLabour and culture are reckoned derogatory to the Spanish character, a sufficient quantity of grain for the support of the inhabitants is not raised, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> for the encouragement of agriculture have been established in different parts of the kingdom. The principal products are wine, delicious fruits, oil, silk, honey, and wax. A considerable proportion of the mountains and valleys is pastured by immense flocks of sheep, whose wool is extremely fine and valuable. Extremadura is noted for its excellent pastures; and the wool in Old Castile is reputed the finest in the kingdom. In Catalonia the hills are covered with forest and fruit trees. Valencia is celebrated for its silk, and for the exquisite flavour of its melons. Murcia abounds in mulberry trees; and the southern provinces yield the most delicious wines and fruits. Upon the whole, it has been observed of Spain, that few countries owe more to nature, and less to industry.\n\nThe soil in general repose on beds of gypsum, which is an excellent manure. The common course of husbandry about Barcelona begins with wheat; which being ripe in June, is immediately succeeded by Indian corn, hemp, millet, cabbage, kidney beans, or lettuce. The second year these same crops succeed each other as before. The next year they take barley, beans, or vetches; which coming off the ground before midsummer, are followed, as in the former years, by other crops, only changing them according to the season, so as to have on the same spot the greatest possible variety. Near Cartagena the course is wheat, barley, and fallow. For wheat they plough thrice, and sow from the middle of November to the beginning of December; in July they reap from 10 to 100 for one, as the season happens to be humid. The rich vale of Alicante yields a perpetual succession of crops. Barley is sown in September, reaped in April; succeeded by maize, reaped in September; and by a mixed crop of cereals which follow. Wheat is sown in November, and reaped in June; flax in September, pulled in May. In the vale of Valencia wheat yields from 20 to 40; barley from 18 to 24; oats from 20 to 30; maize 100; rice 40. The Spanish plough is generally light; and is drawn by oxen with the yoke over the horns; the most proper and natural mode, as the chief strength of the animal centres in the head. For a very minute account of agriculture in Spain, see De Laborde's View, vol iv. chap. 2.\n\nThat prejudice which regards the mechanic arts as state of base, is not yet extinguished in Spain; hence it happens the arts, that these arts are either neglected, or abandoned to such unskilful hands as in general to render the Spaniards much behind their neighbours, in the useful arts of life. The influence of this prejudice is least in the province of Catalonia, where the laws, customs, and opinions are favourable to artisans; and it is accordingly in this province that the mechanic arts have made the greatest progress. Foreign artists experience great difficulties in this country. They are not allowed to practice without gaining admission into some incorporation or company, and this has almost always been refused them.\n\nSome arts have, however, made considerable progress in Spain, especially those of gilding leather, and printing, which has lately acquired a great degree of perfection.\n\nThe fabrication of articles of gold and silver might become an important object in a country where these metals abound; but it is neglected, and the demand is almost entirely supplied from foreign markets. What little they perform in this way at home is usually very ill executed, and exorbitantly dear. Madrid, however, begins to possess some good workmen in this way; encouragement would increase their number, and facilitate the means of improvement; but manual labour is there excessively dear. Hence the Spaniards prefer foreign articles of this kind, which, notwithstanding the expense of carriage, the enormous duties which are paid on these articles, and the profits of the merchants, are still cheaper than those made at home.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERAL_ARTS\">liberal arts</a> are cultivated in this country with more assiduity and success. The 16th century was the most brilliant period of the arts in Spain, as well as of the sciences, of literature, and of the power and grandeur of the monarchy. A crowd of able architects appeared at once under Charles V. and Philip II. They erected numerous edifices, which will immortalize the reigns of these princes and the names of the artists. Juan de Herrera and Cepedes displayed the highest talents; Pedro de U\u00f1a constructed the magnificent bridge of Almaraz, in Extremadura; John-Baptist-Monegro of Toledo, assisted in the building of the Escorial, and of the church of St Peter at Rome.\n\nThe structures of that age are the finest in Spain, and perhaps the only ones in the country which deserve to fix the attention of the skilful spectator. There are some among them which, in regularity, solidity, and magnificence, deserve to be compared with the fine buildings of the Romans. The bridges of Badajoz over the Guadiana, and of Toledo, over the Manzanares, are of this period; as are also the grand house or palace, now the council-\nSpain now possesses an academy of painting, at Seville, and two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> of the fine arts, one at Madrid, and the other at Valencia. The first owes its origin to an association of the painters of Seville formed by themselves, about the year 1665; Charles III. revived it, and established there a school of the fine arts. That of Madrid was founded by Philip V. The last was established by the exertions of some private persons, affiliated by the benediction of Andrew Marjoral, archbishop of Valencia, and the protection of the municipal body. Charles III. came to its affluence 26 years after its establishment, with an annual gift of nearly 700l. These academies have for their object the study and improvement of painting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, and architecture; they give public lessons on these three arts, and distribute annual prizes among their pupils. That of Madrid, or San-Fernando, sends its pupils to Rome at the expense of government, to complete their studies.\n\nPublic and gratuitous schools for drawing have been established within the last 20 years in different places; at Madrid, Cordova, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Barcelona, &c. The last of these is supported by the merchants; that of Vergara was founded by the patriotic society of Biscay; and those of Zaragoza and Cordova owe their birth to the zeal and generosity of two individuals; the first to Don Martin Noy Cocher, the last to Don Antonio Cavallero, the present bishop of Cordova. Those of Madrid, Seville, and Valencia, depend on the academies of these cities.\n\nThe manufactures of Spain were more flourishing during the government of the Moors in that country, than they have been at any subsequent period. So completely had the kingdom declined in this respect at the end of the 16th century, when Philip V. ascended the throne, that it is said by De Laborde to have been absolutely destitute of trade. The intestine wars which ravaged the kingdom during the first 14 years of that reign, and the low state to which the national finances were reduced, prevented the government from paying attention to manufactures; and it was not till after tranquillity had been restored, and regulations adopted with respect to the public revenue, that the natives were induced to wear articles of their own manufacture. Since the reigns of Ferdinand VI. and Charles III., this part of the internal trade of the kingdom has greatly improved, and the manufactures of Spain are now once more on a respectable footing.\n\nThe Spanish manufactures enumerated by De Laborde, in his View of Spain, are those of cloth and other woollen goods; silks; brocaded stuffs in gold and silver; linens and other articles formed from flax or hemp; cottons; leather, and other articles manufactured from skins and hides; paper; china and delft ware; brandies; beer; aquafortis; salt of lead; shears for the woollen trade; copper, iron, and brass goods; glass and mirrors; soap; hats; articles for the marine; military implements; arms and ammunition; tobacco and snuff. Of these, the most important are, the woollen and silk manufactures; leather; brandy; military weapons; soap and tobacco.\n\nThe principal places for the woollen manufactures are, Aubert, Atens, Vich, and the convent of Girona in Catalonia; Jaca, and the district of Cincavilla in Aragon, and Burgos in Old Castile, for woollen stockings; Barcelona, Zaragoza, and Burgos, for blankets; Junquera, Segovia, Burgos, and many others for baizes and\nSpain has long been famous for its manufacture of Spain military weapons; and it is well known that the swords, sabres, hangers, and bayonets, made at Toledo and Barcelona, are of a very superior temper. Large manufactories for fire-arms occur in the district of Guip\u00fazcoa, and two royal foundries for brass cannon, are established at Barcelona and Seville.\n\nThere is only one manufactory for tobacco and snuff in Spain, viz. at Seville; but this is on a most extensive scale, and is supposed to yield an annual profit of about \u00a3800,000 sterling. Here are employed 202 mills, turned by 300 horses or mules; and the various operations call for the daily labour of above 1,400 persons.\n\nConsidering the extent of sea coast belonging to the commerce kingdom of Spain, its commerce is but inconsiderable, and principally takes place between the mother-country and the American colonies. Spain, indeed, carries on a foreign trade with every country in Europe; but its principal transactions are, with England, Holland, Italy, and France. Its exports to these countries consist almost entirely of raw produce, as, if we except oil, wine, brandy, shoes, salt, and a few coarse cloths and filken articles, the trade in manufactured goods is almost wholly confined to the interior of the country. Its chief exports, and the amount yielded by each for the several provinces, as well as the whole amount of the export trade of Spain, to the rest of Europe, will be seen in the following table.\n\n### Value of Exports from each Province in pounds sterling.\n\n| Goods exported | Catalonia | Valencia | Andalusia | Murcia | Aragon | Other Provinces | Total |\n|----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------|\n| Nuts           | L. 26,000 | L.       | L.        | L.     | L.     | L. 8,336        | L. 34,336 |\n| Oil            | 26,667    |          | 208,333   |        |        |                 | 235,000 |\n| Cork           | 235,990   |          |           |        |        |                 | 235,990 |\n| Wine           | 2,667     | 103,333  | 508,333   | 31,250 |        |                 | 645,583 |\n| Linens and cotton stuffs | 295,007 |          |           |        |        |                 | 295,007 |\n| Silk handkerchiefs | 51,042   |          |           |        |        |                 | 51,042 |\n| Paper          | 73,333    |          |           |        |        |                 | 73,333 |\n| Brandy         | 262,500   | 125,000  |           |        |        |                 | 387,500 |\n| Shoes and shoe foles | 22,024   |          |           |        |        |                 | 22,024 |\n| Raifins        | 10,625    |          | 625,000   |        |        |                 | 635,625 |\n| Dried figs     | 5,333     |          | 34,375    |        |        |                 | 39,708 |\n| Almonds        | 6,563     |          |           |        |        |                 | 6,563 |\n| Dates          | 6,250     |          |           |        |        |                 | 6,250 |\n| Barylla        | 15,875    |          | 108,333   |        |        |                 | 124,208 |\n| Kermes         | 7,292     |          |           |        |        |                 | 7,292 |\n| Salt           | 9,250     | 833,333  |           |        |        |                 | 842,583 |\n| Spart worked   |          |          | 4,166     |        |        |                 | 4,166 |\n| Silk           |          |          | 229,166   | 38,333 |        |                 | 267,499 |\n| Cutlery        |          |          | 5,000     |        |        |                 | 5,000 |\n| Ribbons        |          |          | 2,083     |        |        |                 | 2,083 |\n| Corn           |          |          | 78,041    | 53,437 |        |                 | 131,478 |\n| Saffron        |          |          | 2,500     |        |        |                 | 2,500 |\n| Wool           |          |          | 48,750    | 641,682|        |                 | 690,432 |\n| Flax           |          |          | 1,458     |        |        |                 | 1,458 |\n| Coarse cloths  |          |          | 2,666     |        |        |                 | 2,666 |\n| Silk and wool mixtures |          |          | 5,833     |        |        |                 | 5,833 |\n| Worsted stockings |          |          | 540       |        |        |                 | 540 |\n| Salt provisions|          |          |           |        |        |                 | A large quantity from Galicia. |\n| Oranges and lemons |          |          | 79,063    |        |        |                 | 79,063 |\n| Hemp           |          |          |           |        |        |                 | From Old Castile |\n| Madder         |          |          |           |        |        |                 | 66,667 |\n| Brooms         | 6,875     |          |           |        |        |                 | 6,875 |\n\nTotal: 1,002,103, 289,521, 2,209,374, 460,539, 230,080, 716,685, 4,908,304\nThe above table is confined almost entirely to the European exports. To these must be added the amount of Spanish exports to the American colonies in order to acquire a just view of the total amount of the export commerce. The following table will show the amount of the exports, both of home and foreign produce, from Spain to America in 1784, as estimated by Mr Townfend in pounds sterling.\n\n| Port     | Home produce | Foreign produce | Total |\n|----------|--------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Cadiz    | 1,438,912    | 2,182,531       | 3,621,443 |\n| Malaga   | 196,379      | 14,301          | 210,680 |\n| Seville  | 62,713       | 30,543          | 93,256 |\n| Barcelona| 122,631      | 21,240          | 143,871 |\n| Corunna  | 64,575       | 39,062          | 103,537 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-SANTANDER\">Santander</a>| 36,715       | 92,173          | 128,888 |\n| Canaries | 24,974       |                 | 24,974 |\n| Tortosa  | 7,669        | 289             | 7,958 |\n| Gijon    | 4,381        | 10,190          | 14,471 |\n| **Total**| **L.1,958,849** | **L.2,389,229** | **L.4,348,878** |\n\nOf these exports we are to regard chiefly those of Spanish produce, and these Mr Townfend has probably estimated too high. M. de Laborde, on whose authority we are more disposed to rely, states the value of Spanish domestic merchandise exported to America in the year 1788, as amounting to 1,633,658l. sterling, while in 1792, it amounted to 2,812,500l.; and on an average of five years, from 1788 to 1792, it amounted to 1,843,333l. sterling. The amount of foreign merchandise exported in 1788, was 1,434,315l. sterling. Adding the average to this last sum, we have 3,317,648l. sterling for the whole export trade to America. This added to 4,908,304l. sterling, makes a grand total of 8,225,952l. sterling for the whole export trade of Spain.\n\nThe Spanish imports are much more considerable than the exports. Before the present troubles, Spain imported from Holland, tapes, linen drapery, common lace, cutlery goods and paper; from Silecia linen drapery; from Germany, more particularly from Hamburg, quantities of haberdashery; from England, calicoes, iron and steel goods, fine cloth, quantities of cod fish and ling; the value of the last articles is estimated at three millions of duros, five millions livres tournois, (208,333l. 19s. 4d.) from France, calicoes, linen drapery, silk stockings, silks, camlets, and other kinds of worsted stuffs, fine cloths, gilded articles, jewellery, iron goods, haberdashery, steel goods, and perfumery.\n\nWe have not satisfactory documents sufficient to ascertain the amount of these imports, but it was certainly much less than that of the imports from the American colonies. These latter, according to Mr Townfend's statement, amounted in 1784 to 12,635,172l. sterling; to which, if we add nearly half a million for duty, we shall have a total of above thirteen millions sterling for American imports alone. De Laborde estimates the total amount of American imports for the year 1788 at 8,382,320l. sterling, of which Cadiz alone imported 6,617,573l. sterling. If to the above amount we add 577,679l. for the duty at the same period, we shall have a total of 8,960,000l. sterling against the mother country, deducing from this 3,317,648l. for the average exports, we have 5,642,351l. as the balance of trade in favour of the Spanish colonies.\n\nThough there are in Spain many navigable rivers, few canals of communication have been constructed to improve the internal navigation of the country. The canal of Aragon, completed during the reign of Charles IV., must be highly beneficial to that province. Two canals, viz. that of Tucuitre and the imperial canal, both of which begin at Navarre, run in various windings through Aragon, by turns receding from or approaching the river Ebro, where at length they terminate. Besides the dykes, banks, sluices, and bridges necessary in the course of these canals, an aqueduct has been constructed in the valley of Riozalen, 710 fathoms in length, and 17 feet thick at the base, in which the canal runs.\n\nThe canal of Castile, projected and begun in the last reign, has been almost abandoned. It was to commence at Segovia, fifteen leagues north of Madrid, to follow the course of the Eneima, that falls into the Douro, and to be continued as far north as Reynosa; which is twenty leagues from St Ander, a sea port. At Reynosa is the communication with the canal of Aragon, that unites the Mediterranean to the bay of Biscay. Above Palencia, a branch goes westward through Rio-Seco and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVENTO\">Benevento</a> to Zamora; making the canal of Castile, in its whole extent 140 leagues; where it is completed, viz. between Reynosa and Rio-Seco, its width at top is 56 feet, at bottom 25, and nine in depth.\n\nIn 1784, a canal was planned, which, from the foot of the mountains of Guadarama near the Escar, should proceed southward to the Tagus; afterwards to the Guadiana, and terminate at the Guadalquivir above Andaxar. Some other attempts to improve the inland navigation of the country have been unsuccessful.\n\nThere is no nation in Europe which displays such a general variety of national character as Spain. In no two provinces are the manners and character exactly alike. It is therefore difficult to collect traits on which to found the national character of the Spaniards; and this character has been variously represented by different writers. From the transactions which have lately taken place between that people and the British nation, we confess ourselves prejudiced against them; and we shall therefore, instead of sketching their character according to our own preconceived notions, endeavour to delineate it as concisely as possible from De Laborde, who is probably a sufficiently competent judge.\n\nThe national pride, says the author, is everywhere the same. The Spaniard has the highest opinion of his nation and himself, and this he expresses with energy, in his gestures, words, and actions. This opinion is discovered among all ranks in life, and all classes of society. Its result is a kind of haughtiness, sometimes repulsive to him who is its object, but useful in giving to the mind a sentiment of nobleness and self-esteem which fortifies it against all misfortunes.\n\nIn later times the Spaniards have not degenerated from the valour of their ancestors. The Spanish soldiery is still one of the best in Europe, when placed under an experienced general, and brave and intelligent officers. He possesses a cool and steady valour; he long endures fatigue and hunger, and easily induces himself to labour.\n\nThe Spaniards are very reserved, and rather wait for\nthan court the advances of a stranger. Yet in spite of their apparent gravity, they possess an inward gaiety, which frequently shines out when proper occasions call it forth.\n\nThe Spaniard is very slow in all his operations; he often deliberates when he ought to act, and spoils affairs as much by temporizing as the natives of other countries do by precipitation. This tardiness would be but a slight defect, did it not proceed from a serious radical want, from the invincible indolence and hatred of labour which prevails among all ranks of society.\n\nThat jealousy which was formerly proverbial among the Spaniards, is now greatly diminished; husbands are much less suspicious, and women much more accessible. Lattices have disappeared; duennas exist only in romances; veils are exchanged for mantles; houles are thrown open, and the women have recovered a liberty by which they are less tempted to go astray than when their virtue was entrusted to locks and grates, and to the superintendence of guards often faithless and easily corrupted.\n\nIn fine, the Spaniards are sober, discreet, adroit, frank, patient in adversity, slow in decision, but wise in deliberation; ardent in enterprise, and constant in pursuit. They are attached to their religion, faithful to their king, hospitable, charitable, noble in their dealings, generous, liberal, magnificent; good friends, and full of honour. They are grave in carriage, serious in discourse, gentle and agreeable in conversation, and enemies to falsehood and evil speaking.\n\nSuch is the Spanish character as drawn by De Laborde. Its varieties in the several provinces are thus stated by the same author. The Old Castilians are silent, gloomy, and indolent, and are the most severely grave of all the Spaniards; but they possess a steady prudence, an admirable constancy under adversity, an elevation of soul, and an unalterable probity and uprightness. The character of the natives of New Castle is nearly the same, but more open, and less grave and taciturn. Indolence and conceit make part of the character of the people of Navarre; they are distinguished by lightness and adroitness. The Biscayans are proud, impetuous, and irritable; abrupt in discourse and in action; haughty and independent, but industrious, diligent, faithful, hospitable, and sociable. The Galicians are gloomy, and live very little in society; but they are bold, courageous, laborious, very sober, and distinguished for their fidelity. The Asturians partake of the character of the Galicians and Biscayans; but they are less industrious than the former, less civilized, less sociable, less amiable, and more haughty than the latter. The people of Extremadura are proud, haughty, vain, ferocious, indolent; but remarkably sober, honourable, and much attached to their own province, which they seldom quit. The Murcians are lazy, listless, plotting, and suspicious; attached neither to sciences, arts, commerce, navigation, nor a military life. The Valencians are light, inconstant, and indecisive; gay, fond of pleasure, little attached to each other, and still less to strangers, but affable, agreeable, and diligent. The Catalans are proud, haughty, violent in their passions, rude in discourse and in action, turbulent, untractable, and passionately fond of independence; they are not particularly liberal, but active, industrious, and indefatigable; they are sailors, husbandmen, and builders, and resort to all corners of the world to seek their fortunes. They are brave, intrepid, sometimes rash, obstinate in adhering to their schemes, and often successful in vanquishing, by their steady perseverance, obstacles which would appear insurmountable to others.\n\nThe natives of almost every province have some distinguishing peculiarity in their dress, manners, and pursuits. Before the accession of the house of Bourbon to the throne, the usual dress of a Spanish nobleman consisted of a flopped hat, a long black or brown cloak, short jerkin, and straight breeches, with a long Toledo sword; but French dresses are now introduced at court. The higher classes wear their hats under their arm. The common people wrap themselves up to the eyes in a brown cloak, called alepoa, that reaches to the ground; and conceal their hair beneath a cotton cap, and a broad hat called a sombrero. When a lady walks abroad, her head and upper part of her body are covered with a mantilla; that is, a white or black veil, so that it impossible she should be known. At home, the dress is a jacket and a petticoat of silk or cotton. The hair is generally a fine black; and powder is rare.\n\nIn romance, the ladies are celebrated for beauty, and some of them deserve that character; yet beauty is not their general character. They are of a slender make, but with great art they supply the defects of nature. By an indiscriminate use of paint, they disfigure their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> and flatter their skin.\n\nSeveral of the Spanish customs and habits, which seem ridiculous to foreigners, are gradually wearing out, and in process of time will no doubt be corrected. The higher classes at breakfast use chocolate, and seldom tea. Dinner generally consists of beef, veal, pork, mutton, and beans, boiled together. They are fond of garlic; and it is proverbial that olives, salad, and radishes, are food for gentlemen. The men drink little wine, and the women use water or chocolate. Both sexes sleep after dinner, and air themselves in the cool of the evening. Their repasts are composed of sweetmeats, biscuit, coffee and fruit, which servants distribute to the company; who keep their seats, and have little conversation.\n\nDancing and cards are favourite amusements. Theatrical exhibitions are generally insipid or ridiculous bombast, low wit, absurdity, and buffoonery. The combats of the caballeros and bull fights, are almost peculiar to this country. On these occasions young gentlemen were used to show their courage to their mistresses; and were honoured and rewarded according to their success. But these exhibitions were lately conducted with greater economy and parsimony; and mercenary champions studied in the most secure and graceful manner to destroy the devoted animal. See BULL-FIGHTING.\n\nThe chief defect in all ranks is an aversion to labour and industry. The higher orders bestow no attention on agriculture and commerce; they reside for the most part at court and in the metropolis, reckoning it beneath their dignity to live in villas on their estates among their tenants. In their estimation, a labouring man quits the dignity of the Spanish character, and renders himself an object of contempt. Hence a little's indolence prevails. Thousands waste their time in total want of every incitement to action. Their intellectual powers lie dormant, and their views and exertions are confined within the narrow sphere of mere existence. The common people have no encouragement to industry; and must feel little concern\nconcern for the welfare of a country where a few overgrown families engross everything valuable, and never think of the condition of their vassals. The indigent Spaniard does not bestir himself unless impelled by want, because he perceives no advantage to be derived from industry. A stranger to intemperance and excess, his scanty fare is easily procured; and under a climate so propitious, few clothes are required. The hovel which he occupies, together with all its contents, has a mean, filthy, despicable appearance; and all that relates to him bears the imprestion of wretchedness and misery.\n\nThere are certain customs which may be regarded as peculiar to the Spaniards, or which at least are scarcely found in any other European country. The number of servants retained in the families of the higher ranks is prodigious; and even a tradesman's wife, in narrow circumstances, will frequently have four maid servants, though she cannot, with propriety, employ more than two. The houses of gentlemen, and especially of grandees, swarm with them; and, not unfrequently, all the principal servants will have their wives and children lodged with them, and supported by their master. We have heard of one nobleman who was at the daily expense of \u00a320l. merely for the maintenance of his numerous retainers.\n\nThe Spaniards are fond of meeting in the evening in parties, which are often very numerous. On these occasions, the ladies as they arrive place themselves in one room, and the gentlemen in another; or else the ladies range themselves in a line along the side of the room, the lady of the house always taking the lowest place next to the door, whilst the men remain standing, or seat themselves on the opposite side. They remain separated in this manner till the card parties are introduced. They play at loo, loto, and other games of a similar kind. Those who do not play, either look on, or embrace the opportunity of chatting with the person most interesting to them. Others form little circles, where the conversation is usually very animated. These parties very much resemble the French evening, and the English rout.\n\nA refresco sometimes makes part of these entertainments, but only on particular occasions, when the company is more than usually numerous. But orange, lemonade, orangeade, ices of different kinds, sweetmeats, and biscuits, are distributed with uncommon profusion; and chocolate ends the function, as all these entertainments are called.\n\nMany precautions are taken in Spain against the heat. The rooms are watered several times a day, and the windows are shaded on the outside with awnings of cloth or ticking, or on the inside by large and full curtains. In some places, as at Valencia, the glas is taken out of the windows at the approach of summer, and the doors of the apartments are all left open.\n\nThe beds in Spain are hard, being made of mattresses, laid on paillasses, resting on a wooden bottom. The furniture of the houses is usually very simple, and the floors are covered with matting or printed cloth. The chairs have rush bottoms, and are usually of different heights, those for the ladies being one-third lower than those for the gentlemen.\n\nAmong the principal amusements of the Spaniards must be reckoned music and dancing. Though the Spaniards have a taste for music, they are by no means proficient in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. Their principal instrument is the guitar, which is in the hands of every body. Different provinces have also their peculiar instruments. Thus the Gallicians use a dull and heavy bagpipe; the Catalonians a large flageolet, and a little drum or tabor; and the Biscayans a short flute, with four holes. Castanettes are also extremely common, and are employed with great dexterity and address in the national dances.\n\nThe Spaniards are passionately fond of dancing, and they have certain dances which are peculiar to Spain. Of these the fandango is the most celebrated, and appears to be the most ancient. It is a very extraordinary dance, in which the whole body is thrown into a regular and harmonious convulsion, expressive of the most laudable ideas.\n\nThe passion of the Spaniards for these dances is carried to a height which can scarcely be imagined. No sooner are the guitar and the singing to which they are danced heard in a ball-room or theatre, than a murmur of delight arises on all sides; all faces become animated; the feet, hands, and eyes of all present are put in motion: it is impossible to describe the effect produced. Mr Townfend, an English traveller, affirms, that if a person were to come suddenly into a church or a court of justice playing the fandango, or the colero, priests, judges, lawyers, criminals, audience, one and all, grave and gay, young or old, would quit their functions, forget all distinctions, and all let themselves a dancing.\n\nThe Spanish balls are directed by two persons chosen among the visitors, who are called bailereras, and with the hat under the arm, and the cane in the hand, perform the office of masters of the ceremonies. One is for the gentlemen, the other for the ladies. It is their business to appoint who is to dance, whether minuets or country dances; they are in general very attentive to the observance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> and etiquette, and have usually the complaisance to contrive that those shall dance together to whom it is peculiarly agreeable to meet.\n\nA singular custom is observed at these balls, which appears new and strange to a foreigner. The lady chosen to dance rises, crosses the room alone, and places herself where she is to begin dancing, without waiting for her partner to lead her out; and after the dance is over, her partner makes his bow to her again in the middle of the room without taking any further concern about her, or handing her back to her place. But this custom prevails only in the provinces.\n\nThe bull-fights noticed above were once not only a favourite but a fashionable spectacle in Spain. Every city, and almost every small town, had a place set apart for these daring combats; and hither all ranks and ages resorted with the greatest avidity, and witnessed the prowess of the combatants, and the torture of the wretched animals, whom they were hired to butcher, with the most savage expressions of delight. These fights made a part of every festival, and, as soon as they were announced, the housewife left her family, the tradesman forsook his shop, the artist his work-room, the labourer his field, and joy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> were painted on every countenance. To the honour of the nation, these cruel sports are at length abolished, and Spain has thus set an example of humanity, which Britain, with all her civilization and refinement, need not blush to copy.\nNew-Spain. See Mexico.\n\nSpalatro, or Spalatto, a rich, populous, and strong town of the republic of Venice, capital of Venetian Dalmatia, with a good harbour and an archbishop's see. Here are the ruins of the palace of Dioecissus, of which the late Mr Robert Adam published in 1764 a splendid account, enriched with 71 folio plates. In 1784, Spalatro was nearly depopulated by the plague. It is strong by situation, being built on a peninsula, which is joined to terra firma by a neck of land half a mile over. It is seated on the gulf of Venice, 35 miles south-east of Sebenico, and 102 north-west of Ragusa.\n\nE. Long. 17\u00b0 31'. N. Lat. 44\u00b0 4'.\n\nSpallanzani, Lazarus, a celebrated naturalist, was born at Scandiano, in the duchy of Modena, in January 1729. He began his studies in his native country, and went to Reggio de Modena at 15 years of age, to prosecute them further. He was instructed in the belles lettres by the Jesuits, who contended with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a> in order to secure his attachment; but his thirst for knowledge determined him to go to Bologna, where his relative Laura Balbi, a woman highly celebrated for her genius, eloquence, and skill in natural philosophy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, was one of the most distinguished professors of the Institute and of Italy. Under this enlightened guide, he was taught to prefer the study of nature to that of her commentators, judging of the real value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> by its resemblance to the original. He availed himself of the wisdom of that lady's counsels, the happy effects of which he very soon experienced. Spallanzani's taste for philosophy was not exclusive, for he carefully studied his own language, became a proficient in the Latin tongue, and attached himself above every other to the Greek and French. By the advice of a father whom he ardently loved, he applied himself to jurisprudence; but being urged by Anthony Vallifinieri to renounce his vocation, by procuring the consent of his father, he gave himself up to the study of mathematics with more zeal than ever, at the same time devoting himself to the study of languages, both living and dead.\n\nIt was not long before he was known all over Italy, and what is seldom the case, his own country first put that value on his talents which they justly merited. He was chosen professor of logic, metaphysics and Greek, in the university of Reggio, in the year 1745, where he taught during ten years, devoting every moment of his leisure time to the study and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the works of nature. The attention of Haller and Bonnet was fixed by his observations on the animalcule of infusions, the latter afflicting him in his laudable career, and ever after distinguishing him as one of the learned interpreters of nature.\n\nSpallanzani was invited to the university of Modena in the year 1763, and some years after he declined to accept of the offers made to him by the academy of Petersburg, as well as similar ones from Coimbra, Parma, and Cefalu, though extremely advantageous. He preferred his native spot, and therefore continued at Modena till the year 1768, and saw raised up, by his care a generation of men constituting at that time the glory of Italy, among whom we find Venturi, Belloni, Lucchesini, and Angelo Mazzo.\n\nWhile Spallanzani remained at Modena, he published his Saggio di Osservazioni Microscopiche concernente il Sistema di Needham e Buffon, in 1763, in which he establishes, by a number of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and solid experiments, the animality of microscopic animalcula. This work was sent by the author to Bonnet, who drew from it a prediction respecting the future celebrity of Spallanzani, which he lived to see accomplished. This circumstance gave birth to the most intimate friendship, which lasted to the close of life, and constituted their chief happiness. During the same year he published a truly original work, entitled De Lapidibus ab aqua rosilentibus, in which he proves, in opposition to the commonly received opinion, by the most satisfactory experiments, that what are called ducks and drakes, are not produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> of the water, but by the effect naturally resulting from the change of direction experienced by the stone in its movement, after it has struck the water, and that it has been carried over the hollow of the cup formed by the concavities.\n\nWhen the university of Padua was re-established upon a larger scale, the Count de Firmian was directed by the empress Maria Theresa, to invite Spallanzani to be professor of natural history, to which his great reputation made him competent, although it was solicited by many celebrated characters; and he merited it by his success, as immense crowds of students thronged to his lectures. He had a fine genius, and his knowledge was of vast extent; his method was simple, but rigorous in its nature, and what he knew he connected with principles firmly established. He acquired the valuable art of interpreting nature by herself, which diffused such a light over his lectures, that everything became perspicuous, which could be said to afford any instruction. His discourses were plain and animated, and the elegance and purity of his style charmed every hearer. He prepared his lectures a year before hand, and it was his chief aim to render them useful in an eminent degree. His new observations made them always new and engaging. Many learned persons who attended his lectures were not above becoming his scholars, in order to acquire a more extensive knowledge of what they knew before, and to learn that which otherwise they might probably never have known. The Contemplation de la Nature of Bonnet was his text book, the vacancies of which he ably filled up, fully explained the ideas, and established the theories by his own experiments. This work was translated by him into the Italian language, and he added much to its value by notes of his own, the first volume of which he published in 1769, and the second the following year.\n\nHis connection with Bonnet tended, in a great measure, to influence his genius, which yielded to the severe method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> adopted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of Geneva. He was proud of being the pupil of such an illustrious character, upon whose writings he incessantly bestowed every leisure moment, and thus became anxious to learn from Nature herself the proofs of Bonnet's sentiments respecting the generation of organized bodies, the pleasing nature of which research captivated his attention for a considerable time.\n\nThe first two volumes of this work entitled Opuscoli di Fisica Animale e Vegetabile, were published in the year 1776, containing the explanation of part of the microscopic observations which were previously given to the world.\n\nIf it must be admitted that the art of accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>...\ntion is by far the most difficult, it cannot be denied that it is at the same time the most necessary, and requires the most brilliant talents and abilities, which were possessed by Spallanzani in a remarkable degree, as is fully convinced by all his researches and all his admirable writings.\n\nThe polite manner in which he conducted his dispute with Needham respecting the phenomena of generation, secured for him a high degree of applause. On this occasion he treated of the influence of cold upon animals, and proved that the torpidity of some during winter, does not depend on the impression the blood may receive from it, since a frog deprived of blood, becomes torpid when reduced to the same cold state by being immersed in ice, and swims as formerly when restored to a proper degree of warmth.\n\nSpallanzani travelled through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> and the Grisons in the year 1779, after which he went to Geneva, spending a month with his friends, by whom his conversation was as much admired as his masterly writings. From this place he returned to Pavia, and in 1780 published two more volumes of his \"Diffrazione di Fisica Animale e Vegetabile,\" wherein he unfolded the secrets of the interpretation of two very intricate phenomena, concerning the economy of animals and vegetables. He was led to this study from some experiments made by him upon digestion, for his lectures; and he repeated the experiments of Reaumur on gallinaceous birds, remarking that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRITURATION\">trituration</a> which in this case is favourable to digestion, could not be a very powerful means. He perceived that the gizzard of those birds, by which the stones of fruit are pulverized, did not digest the powder thus formed, it being necessary that it should undergo a new operation in the stomach, previous to its becoming chyle for the production of the blood and other humours.\n\nThis subject may be regarded as one of the most difficult in physiology, because the observer is always under the necessity of acting and looking in the midst of darkness; the animal must be managed with care, that the derangement of the operations may be avoided; and when the experiments are completed with great labour, it is requisite that the consequences be well distinguished. Spallanzani in this work is truly enchanting, analysing facts with scrupulousness, in order to ascertain their causes with certainty; comparing Nature with his experiments, in order to form a correct judgement respecting them; laying hold of every thing essential to them in his observations, and measuring their solidity by the increase or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of supposed causes.\n\nMr John Hunter appears to have been greatly hurt by this work, which led him to publish, in the year 1795, \"Some Observations upon Digestion,\" in which he threw out some bitter sarcasms against the Italian naturalist, who took ample revenge by publishing this work in the Italian language, and addressing to Caldani in 1788, \"Una Lettera Apologetica in Risposta alle Offenzive del Signor Giovanni Hunter.\" In this he exposed with great moderation, but at the same time with logic which nothing could resist, the mistakes and errors of the British physiologist, leaving the power of a reply altogether hopeless.\n\nThe generation of animals and plants is treated of in the second volume of this last-mentioned work, in which he proves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRE_EXISTENCE\">pre-existence</a> of germs to fecundation, by experiments as satisfactory as surprising; shewing also the existence of tadpoles in the females of five different species of frogs, in salamanders, and toads, before their fecundation. He likewise recounts the success of some artificial fecundations upon the tadpoles of those five species, and even upon a quadruped.\n\nIn the year 1781, he took the advantage of the academical vacation, for the purpose of making a journey, in order to add to the cabinet of Pavia. He set out for Marseilles in the month of July that year, where he began a new history of the sea, which presented him with many new and curious facts on numerous genera of the natives of the ocean. He went also to Finale, Genoa, Malta, and Carrara, to make observations on the quarries of marble, held by flutuators in such estimation. He then returned to Spezzia, and brought from thence to Pavia a vast number of fishes, which he deposited in the cabinet of that city, wholly collected by himself. With the same view and success he visited the coasts of Istria in 1782, and the Apennine mountains the following year, taking notice of the dreadful hurricanes, and the astonishing vapours by which that year became so noted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">meteorology</a>. The emperor Joseph, on examining this cabinet presented Spallanzani with a gold medal. In 1785, he was offered the chair of natural history by the university of Padua, vacant by the death of Anthony Vallini; but in order to prevent his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of it, his salary was doubled by the archduke, and he went to Constantinople with Chevalier Zuliani, who had been appointed ambassador from the Venetian republic. He set out on the 21st of August, and reached the Turkish metropolis on the 11th of October, where he remained during eleven months. His attention was fixed by the physical and moral phenomena of this country, which were new even to Spallanzani. He strayed along the borders of the two seas, and ascended the mountains in the vicinity; he paid a visit to the island of Chalki, discovering to the Turks a copper mine, the existence of which they had never once conjectured. He discovered an iron mine not far from Constantinople, in the island of Principi, of which the Turks were equally ignorant, and prepared to return for Italy on the 16th of August 1786.\n\nA voyage by sea was undoubtedly the safest, but the dangers to which he would be exposed by land were regarded as nothing when contrasted with the idea of being beneficial to science and to man. Having reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BUCHAREST\">Bucharest</a>, Muroceni the friend of science, received Spallanzani with marks of distinction, presented him with many rarities which the country produced, and gave him horses for travelling, with an escort of 30 troopers, to the utmost confines of his own dominions. Our philosopher passed by Hermannstadt in Transylvania, and reached Vienna on the 7th of December, where he remained during five days, and had two long conferences with the emperor Joseph II., was much esteemed by the nobility of that city, and respectfully visited by many literary characters. When he arrived at Pavia, the students went out of the city gates to meet him, and testified their joy at his return by repeated acclamations. He was almost instantly drawn to the auditory, and compelled to ascend the chair from which he had been accustomed to deliver his fascinating lectures; but their demonstrations of joy and shouts of applause made him request of them to give over, and indulge him with that\nthat repulse in his own house which was now so absolutely necessary. His students this year exceeded 500.\n\nSo extensive was the fame of Spallanzani become by this time, that envy was determined, if possible, to wound his reputation. If his discoveries were too new, solid, and original, to be successfully disputed, that vile passion, or rather feuds, began to question his integrity and uprightness respecting the administration of the cabinet of Pavia; but this injurious attempt to tarnish his honour, only made it thenceforth with redoubled splendour. The juridical examination of the tribunals made his integrity appear even purer than before; and it must be mentioned to his honour, that he had the fortitude to forget this event; his enemies in general confessed their mistake, renounced their unprovoked animosity, and still hoped to regain a friendship of which they had proved themselves unworthy.\n\nIn the voyage of Spallanzani we meet with what may be denominated a new volcanology. We are there instructed how to measure the intensity of volcanic fires, and in his analysis of the lava, almost to touch the particular gas which tears those torrents of stone in fusion from the bowels of the earth, and raises them to the top of Mount Etna. This delightful work is closed by some important enquiries into the nature of Swallows, the mildness of their dispositions, the rapidity of their flight, discussing the celebrated problem respecting their remaining torpid during the winter season, proving that artificial cold, much more intense than what is ever naturally experienced in our climates, does not reduce these birds to the torpid state.\n\nThings apparently impossible were often discovered by Spallanzani. In the year 1795 he made one of this description, which he gave to the world in his Lettere sopra il sospetto d'un nuovo senso nei Pipistrelli. In that work we are informed that bats, if deprived of sight, act with the same precision in every instance as those which have their eyes; that they scan in the same manner the most trivial obstacles, and also know where to fix themselves when their flight is terminated. Several philosophers confirmed these astonishing experiments, from which a suspicion arose, that these animals must have a new sense, as it appeared to Spallanzani that the other known senses could not compensate for the want of sight; but he afterwards inclined to think, in consequence of Professor Jardine's experiments on the organ of hearing in bats, that in this particular instance the sense of hearing might possibly supply the want of sight.\n\nThe literary career of this celebrated naturalist was terminated by a letter to Giobert, entitled Sopra la pianta chiusa ne' casi dentro l'acqua e l'aria, esplose a l'immediata lume solare e a Pombara. These numerous works, which met with the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>, do not comprehend the whole of his multifarious labours; for the phenomena of respiration had occupied his attention a considerable time; their points of resemblance and dissimilitude in many species of animals; and he had nearly finished his voyage to Constantinople, as well as collected many valuable materials for a history of the sea, when his life and labours were unfortunately terminated.\n\nHe was seized with a retention of urine on the 4th of February 1799, and next morning was deprived of the regular use of his faculties, only enjoying a sound mind during very short intervals. Tourdes and Professor Spallanzani did everything to save him, which could be produced by the joint exertions of genius, experience, and friendship, but in vain. He died on the 17th; but we know not what credit is due to the affection, that he edified those around him during his last moments by his piety. Be that as it may, while his works exist to speak for themselves, impartial posterity will regard him as a very extraordinary man. These works have been translated into almost every European language, and he was admitted a member of the academies and learned societies of London, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a>, Holland, Lyons, Bologna, Turin, Padua, Mantua, and Geneva, and he received from Frederick the Great the diploma of member of the academy of Berlin.","sp":86,"ep":155},{"h":"SPANDRELLI","t":"the solid work on each launch of an arch, to keep it from spreading.","sp":155,"ep":155},{"h":"SPANHEIM","t":"Ezekiel, a learned writer in the 17th century, was born at Geneva in 1629; and in 1642 went to Leyden to study.

This task our author discharged to the entire satisfaction of the elector; by whom he was also employed in divers negotiations at foreign courts. He afterwards entered into the service of the elector of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDENBURG\">Brandenburg</a>, who in 1680 sent him envoy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> to the court of France, and soon after made him a minister of state.

See the article Lycurgus.\n\nAfter his death, the first important transaction which we find mentioned in the Spartan history is the Messenian war, which commenced in the year 752 B.C. and ended in the total reduction of the Messenian territory, as related under the article Messenia. During this period, according to some authors, a great change took place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Sparta. This was the creation of the ephori, which is ascribed to one of the kings named Theopompus. This man perceiving that there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for leaving magistrates to execute the laws, when the kings were obliged to be in the field, appointed the magistrates above mentioned, who afterwards made so great a figure in the state (see Ephori). One great privilege of the ephori was, that they did not rise up at the presence of the kings, as all other magistrates did; another was, that if the kings offended against the laws, the ephori took cognizance of the offence, and inflicted a suitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. From the first election of the ephori, the year was denominated, as at Athens, from the first election of the archons.\n\nThe conquest of Messenia gave Sparta the superiority over the rest of the states, excepting only that of Athens, which for a long time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be a very troublesome rival: but the contests between these two rival states have been so fully related under the article Attica, that nothing more is requisite to be added in this place.\u2014In the time of the Persian war, Leonidas the Spartan king, distinguished himself in such a manner, as to become the admiration not only of that but of every succeeding age. It being resolved in a general council to defend the straits of Thermopylae against the Persians, 7000 foot were put under the command of Leonidas; of whom, however, only 300 were Spartans. Leonidas did not think it practicable to defend the pass against such multitudes as the Persian king commanded; and therefore privately told his friends, that his design was to devote himself to death for his country.\n\nXerxes advancing near the straits, was strangely surprised to find that the Greeks were resolved to dispute his passage; for he had always flattered himself, that on his approach they would betake themselves to flight, and not attempt to oppose his innumerable forces. However, Xerxes still entertaining some hopes of their flight, waited four days without undertaking any thing, on purpose to give them time to retreat. During this time, he used his utmost endeavours to gain and corrupt Leonidas, promising to make him master of all Greece if he would come over to his interest. His offers being fed with contempt and indignation, the king ordered great ed him by a herald to deliver up his arms. Leonidas, slaughtered in a style and with a spirit truly laconical, answered, \"Come thyself, and take them.\" Xerxes, at this reply, transported with rage, commanded the Medes and Cilicians to march against them, take them all alive, and bring them to him in fetters. The Medes, not able to stand the shock of the Greeks, soon betook themselves to flight; and in their room Hydarnes was ordered to advance with that body which was called Immortal, and consisted of 10,000 chosen men; but when these came to close with the Greeks, they succeeded no better than the Medes and Cilicians, being obliged to retire with great slaughter. The next day the Persians, reflecting on the small number of their enemies, and supposing too many of them to be wounded that they could not possibly maintain a second fight, resolved to make another attempt; but could not by any efforts make the Greeks give way: on the contrary, they were themselves put to a shameful flight. The valour of the Greeks exerted itself on this occasion in a manner so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, that Xerxes is said to have three times leaped from his throne, apprehending the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of his army.\n\nXerxes having lost all hopes of forcing his way through troops that were determined to conquer or die, was extremely perplexed and doubtful what measures he should take in this posture of affairs; when one Epialtes, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a great reward, came to him, and discovered a secret passage to the top of the hill which they overlooked and commanded the Spartan forces. The known a king immediately ordered Hydarnes thither with his feet over each body of 10,000 Persians; who marching all night, surrounded arrived at break of day, and possessed themselves of that the Greeks advantageous post. The Phocians, who defended this pass, being overpowered by the enemy's numbers, retired with precipitation to the very top of the mountain, prepared to die gallantly. But Hydarnes neglecting to pursue them, marched down the mountain with all possible expedition, in order to attack those who defended the straits in the rear. Leonidas being now apprised that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to bear up against the enemy, obliged the rest of his allies to retire; but he stood himself, with the Thebians, Thebans, and 300 Lacedemonians, all resolved to die with their leader; who being told by the oracle, that either Sparta should be destroyed or the king lose his life, determined without the least hesitation to sacrifice himself for his country. The Thebans indeed remained against their inclination, being detained by Leonidas as hostages; for they were suspected to favour the Persians. The Thebians, with their leader Demophilus, could not by any means be prevailed upon to abandon Leonidas and the Spartans. The augur Megistias, who had foretold the event of this enterprise, being pressed by Leonidas to retire, sent home his only son; but remained himself, and died by Leonidas. Those who stood did not feed themselves with any hopes of conquering or escaping, but looked upon Thermopylae as their graves; and when Leonidas, exhorting them to take some nourishment, said, that they should...\nSparta should all sup together with Pluto, with one accord they set up a shout of joy, as if they had been invited to a banquet.\n\nXerxes, after pouring out a libation at the rising of the sun, began to move with the whole body of his army, as he had been advised by Epialtes. Upon their approach, Leonidas advanced to the broadest part of the passageway, and fell upon the enemy with such undaunted courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, that the Persian officers were obliged to stand behind the divisions they commanded, in order to prevent the flight of their men. Great numbers of the enemy falling into the sea, were drowned; others were trampled under foot by their own men, and a great many killed by the Greeks; who knowing they could not avoid death upon the arrival of those who were advancing to fall upon their rear, exerted their utmost efforts. In this action fell the brave Leonidas; which Abrocomes and Hyperanthus, two of the brothers of Xerxes, observing, advanced with great resolution to seize his body, and carry it in triumph to Xerxes. But the Lacedemonians, more eager to defend it than their own lives, repulsed the enemy four times, killed both the brothers of Xerxes, with many other commanders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, and rescued the body of their beloved general out of the enemy's hands. But in the meantime, the army that was led by the treacherous Epialtes, advancing to attack their rear, they retired to the narrowest place of the passageway, and drawing all together except the Thebans, posted themselves on a rising ground. In this place they made head against the Persians, who poured in upon them on all sides, till at length, not vanquished, but oppressed and overwhelmed by numbers, they all fell, except one who escaped to Sparta, where he was treated as a coward and traitor to his country; but afterwards made a glorious reparation in the battle of Platea, where he distinguished himself in an extraordinary manner. Some time after, a magnificent monument was erected at Thermopylae, in honour of those brave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEFENDERS\">defenders</a> of Greece, with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>; the one general, and relating to all those who died on this occasion, importing, that the Greeks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>, to the number only of 4,000, made head against the Persian army, consisting of 3,000,000. The other related to the Spartans in particular, and was composed by the poet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIMONIDES\">Simonides</a>, to this purport: \"Go, passenger, and acquaint the Spartans that we died here in obedience to their just commands.\" At those tombs a funeral oration was yearly pronounced in honour of the dead heroes, and public games performed with great solemnity, wherein none but the Lacedemonians and Thebans had any share, to show that they alone were concerned in the glorious defence of Thermopylae.\n\nAt the end of the 77th Olympiad, a most dreadful earthquake happened at Sparta, in which, according to Diodorus, 20,000 persons lost their lives; and Plutarch tells us, that only five houses were left standing in the whole city. On this occasion the Helotes or slaves, whom the Spartans had all along treated with the utmost cruelty, attempted to revenge themselves, by taking up arms, and marching directly to the ruins of the city, in hopes of cutting off at once those who had escaped from the earthquake. But in this they were prevented by the prudence of the Spartan king Archidamus; for he, observing that the citizens were more desirous of preserving their effects than taking care of their own lives, caused an alarm to be founded, as if he had known that an enemy was at hand. On this the citizens armed themselves in haste with such weapons as they could come at; and having marched a little way from the city, met the Helotes, whom they soon compelled to retire. The latter, however, knowing that they had now no mercy to expect from those who had already treated them with such cruelty, resolved to defend themselves to the last. Having therefore seized a sea-port town in Messenia, they from thence made such incursions into the Spartan territories, that they compelled those imperious masters to ask assistance from the Athenians. This was immediately granted; but when the Spartans saw that the skill of the Athenians in besieging towns was much greater than their own, they became jealous, and disdained their allies, telling them, that they had now no farther occasion for their services. On this the Athenians left them in disgust; and as the Helotes and Messenians did not choose to come to an engagement with a Spartan army in the field, but took shelter in their fortified places, the war was protracted for ten years and upwards. At last the Helotes were reduced to their former misery; and the Messenians were obliged to leave Peloponnesus, on pain of being made slaves also. These poor people were then received by the Athenians, who granted them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAUPACTUS\">Naupactus</a> for their residence, and afterwards brought them back to a part of their own country, from whence in the course of the Peloponnesian war they had driven the Spartans.\n\nIn the year 431 B.C. the Peloponnesian war commenced; of which a full account has been given under the article Attica, No. 116\u2014165. It ended most unfortunately for the Athenians; their city being taken and dismantled, as related in the article above mentioned. Thus were the Spartans raised to the highest pitch of glory; and, in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGESILAUS\">Agesilaus</a>, they seemed to be on the point of subverting the Persian empire, as related under the article Persia, No. 34. But here their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> and their views of empire were suddenly checked. Agesilaus had carried on the war in Asia with the greatest success; and as he would have nothing to terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, a Persian governor named Tithraustes, having first attempted in vain to bribe the king, dispatched Timocrates the Rhodian with 50 talents into Greece, in order to try whether he could there meet with any person less incorruptible than the Spartan monarch. This agent found many who inclined to accept his offers; particularly in Thebes, Corinth, and Argos. By distributing the money in a proper manner, he inflamed the inhabitants of these three cities against the Spartans; and of all others the Thebans came into his terms with the greatest readiness. They saw that their antagonists would not of their own accord break with any of the states of Greece, and did not choose to begin the war themselves, because the chiefs of the Persian faction were unwilling to be accountable for the event. For this reason they persuaded the Locrians to invade a small district which lay in dispute between the Phocians and themselves. On this the Phocians invaded Locri; the Locrians applied to the Thebans, and the Phocians to the Spartans. The latter were glad of an opportunity of breaking with the Thebans; but met with a much warmer reception than they expected. Their old general Lygander, who had\nreduced Athens, was defeated and killed, with the loss of 1000 men; on which disaster Agesilaus was recalled, and obliged to relinquish all hopes of conquering the Persians. His return changed the fortune of the war so much, that all the states began to grow weary of a contest from which nobody derived any advantage except the king of Persia. In a short time a treaty was concluded, known in history by the name of the peace of Antalcidas. The terms of this treaty were highly advantageous and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to the Greeks; for even the Spartans, though successful in Greece, had lost a great battle at sea with the Persian fleet under Conon the Athenian, which entirely broke their power in Asia.\n\nBy the peace of Antalcidas, the government of Boeotia was taken from the Thebans, which they had for a long time enjoyed; and by this they were so much provoked, that at first they absolutely refused to accede to the treaty; but as Agesilaus made great preparations to invade them, they thought proper at last to comply. However, it was not long before a new war commenced, which threatened the total subversion of the Spartan state. As, by the peace of Antalcidas, the king of Persia had in a manner guaranteed the sovereignty of Greece to Sparta, this republic very soon began to exercise its power to the utmost extent. The Mantineans were the first who felt the weight of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, although they had been their allies and confederates. In order to have a pretence for making war against them, they commanded them to quit their city, and to retire into five old villages which, they said, had served their forefathers, and where they would live in peace themselves, and give no umbrage to their neighbours. This being refused, an army was sent against them to besiege their city. The siege was continued through the summer with very little success on the part of the Spartans; but having during the winter season dammed up the river on which the city stood, the water rose to such a height, as either to overflow or throw down the houses; which compelled the Mantineans to submit to the terms preferred to them, and to retire into the old villages. The Spartan vengeance fell next on the Phliasians and Olynthians, whom they forced to come into such measures as they thought proper. After this they fell on the Thebans, and, by attempting to seize on the Pireum, drew the Athenians also into the quarrel. But here their career was stopped: the Thebans had been taught the art of war by Chabrias the Athenian; so that even Agesilaus himself took the command of the Spartan army in vain. At sea they were defeated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMOTHEUS\">Timotheus</a> the son of Conon; and by land the battle of Leuctra put an end to the superiority which Sparta had held over Greece for near 500 years. See LEUCTRA.\n\nAfter this dreadful defeat, the Spartans had occasion to exert all their courage and resolution. The women and nearest relations of those who were killed in battle, instead of spending their time in lamentations, shook each other by the hand, while the relations of those who had escaped from the battle hid themselves among the women; or if they were obliged to go abroad, they appeared in tattered clothes, with their arms folded, and their eyes fixed on the ground. It was a law among the Spartans, that such as fled from battle should be degraded from their honours, should be constrained to appear in garments patched with divers colours, to wear their beards half-shaved, and to suffer any to beat them who pleased, without resistance. At present, however, this law was dispensed with; and Agesilaus by his prudent conduct kept up the spirits of the people, at the same time that by his skill in military affairs he checked the progress of the enemy. Yet, during the lifetime of Epaminondas the Theban general, the war went on greatly to the disadvantage of the Spartans; but he being killed at the battle of Mantinea, all parties became quickly desirous of peace. Agesilaus did not long survive; and with him, we may say, perished the glory of Sparta. Soon after this all the states of Greece fell under the power of Alexander the Great; and the Spartans, as well as the rest, having become corrupt, and lost their martial spirit, became a prey to domestic tyrants, and to foreign invaders. They maintained their ground, however, with great resolution against the celebrated Pyrrhus king of Epirus; whom they repulsed for three days successively, though not without assistance from one of the captains of Antigonus. Soon after this, one of the kings of Sparta named Agis, perceiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> degeneracy that had taken place, made an attempt to reform the laws and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of Lycurgus, by which he supposed the state would be restored to its former glory. But though at first he met Agis and with some appearance of success, he was in a short time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CLEOMENES\">Cleomenes</a> tried and condemned by the ephori as a traitor to his country. Cleomenes, however, who ascended the throne in 216 B.C., accomplished the reformation which Agis had attempted in vain. He suppressed the ephori; cancelled all debts; divided the lands equally, as they had been in the time of Lycurgus; and put an end to the luxury which prevailed among the citizens. But at last he was overcome by the number of enemies which surrounded him; and being defeated in battle by Antigonus, he fled to Egypt, where he put an end to his own life. With him perished every hope of retrieving the affairs of Sparta: the city for the present fell into the hands of Antigonus; after which a succession of tyrants took place; till at last all disturbances were ended by the Romans, who reduced MACEDON and GREECE to provinces of their empire, as has been related under these articles.\n\nIt remains now only to say something concerning the institutions character, manners, and customs of the Spartans, which, as they were founded on the laws of Lycurgus, may best be learned from a view of these laws.\n\nThe institutions of Lycurgus were divided into 12 His laws tables. The first comprehended such of the Spartan concerning laws as regarded religion. The statues of all the gods religion, and goddesses were represented in armour, even to Venus herself; the reason of which was, that the people might conceive a military life the most noble and honourable, and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a>, as other nations did, sloth and luxury to the gods. As to sacrifices, they consisted of things of very small value; for which Lycurgus himself gave this reason. That want might never hinder them from worshipping the gods. They were forbidden to make long or rash prayers to the heavenly powers, and were enjoined to ask no more than that they might live honestly and discharge their duty. Graves were permitted to be made within the bounds of the city, contrary to the custom of most of the Greek nations; nay, they buried close by their temples, that all degrees\nof people might be made familiar with death, and not conceive it such a dreadful thing as it was generally esteemed elsewhere: on the same account, the touching dead bodies, or afflicting at funerals, made none unclean, but were held to be as innocent and honourable duties as any other. There was nothing thrown into the grave with the dead body; magnificent sepulchres were forbidden; neither was there so much as an inscription, however plain or modest, permitted. Tears, sighs, outcries, were not allowed in public, because they were thought dishonourable in Spartans, whom their lawgiver would have to bear all things with equanimity. Mourning was limited to 11 days; on the 12th the mourner sacrificed to Ceres, and threw aside his weeds. In favour of such as were slain in the wars, however, and of women who devoted themselves to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> life, there was an exception allowed as to the rules before mentioned; for such had a short and decent inscription on their tombs. When a number of Spartans fell in battle, at a distance from their country, many of them were buried together under one common tomb; but if they fell on the frontiers of their own state, then their bodies were carefully carried back to Sparta, and interred in their family sepulchres.\n\nII. Lycurgus divided all the country of Laconia into 30,000 equal shares: the city of Sparta he divided into 900, as some say; into 600, as others say; and as a third party will have it, into 450. The intent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> was, that property should be equally divided among his citizens, so that none might be powerful enough to oppress his fellows, or any be in such necessity, as to be therefrom in danger of corruption. With the same view he forbade the buying or selling their possessions. If a stranger acquired a right to any of these shares, he might quietly enjoy it, provided he submitted to the laws of the republic. The city of Sparta was unvalled; Lycurgus trusting it rather to the virtue of its citizens than to the art of masons. As to the houses, they were very plain; for their ceilings could only be wrought by the axe, and their gates and doors only by the saw; and their utensils were to be of a like stamp, that luxury might have no instruments among them.\n\nIII. The citizens were to be neither more nor less than the number of city lots; and if at any time there happened to be more, they were to be led out in colonies. As to children, their laws were equally harsh and unreasonable; for a father was directed to carry his new-born infant to a certain place, where the gravest men of his tribe looked upon the infant; and if they perceived its limbs straight, and thought it had a wholesome look, they then returned it to its parents to be educated; otherwise it was thrown into a deep cavern at the foot of the mountain Taygetus. This law seems to have had one very good effect, viz. making women very careful, when they were with child, of either eating, drinking, or exercising, to excess; it made them also excellent nurses; for which they were in mighty request throughout Greece. Strangers were not allowed to reside long in the city, that they might not corrupt the Spartans by teaching them new customs. Citizens were also forbidden to travel, for the same reason, unless the good of the state required it. Such as were not bred up in their youth according to the law, were not allowed the liberty of the city, because they held it unreasonable, that one who had not submitted to the laws in his youth should receive the benefit of them when a man. They never preferred any stranger to a public office; but if at any time they had occasion for a person not born a Spartan, they first made him a citizen, and then preferred him.\n\nIV. Celibacy in men was infamous, and punished in a most extraordinary manner; for the old bachelor was and marooned to walk naked, in the depth of winter, through the market-place: while he did this, he was obliged to sing a song in disparagement of himself; and he had none of the honours paid him which otherwise belonged to old age, it being held unreasonable, that the youth should venerate him who was resolved to leave none of his progeny behind him, to revere them when they grew old in their turn. The time of marriage was also fixed; and if a man did not marry when he was of full age, he was liable to an action; as were such also as married above or below themselves. Such as had three children had great immunities; such as had four were free from all taxes whatsoever. Virgins were married without portions; because neither want should hinder a man, nor riches induce him, to marry contrary to his inclinations. When a marriage was agreed on, the husband committed a kind of rape upon his bride. Husbands went for a long time, secretly and by stealth, to the beds of their wives, that their love might not be quickly and easily extinguished. Husbands were allowed to lend their wives; but the kings were forbidden to take this liberty. Some other laws of the like nature there were, which as they were evidently against modesty, so they were far from producing the end for which Lycurgus designed them; since, though the men of Sparta were generally remarkable for their virtue, the Spartan women were as generally decried for their boldness and contempt of decency.\n\nV. It was the care of Lycurgus, that, from their very birth, the Lacedemonians should be inured to conquer their appetites: for this reason he directed children, that nurses should accustom their children to spare meals, and now and then to fasting; that they should carry them, when 12 or 13 years old, to those who should examine their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and who should carefully observe whether they were able to be in the dark alone, and whether they had got over all other follies and weaknesses incident to children. He directed, that children of all ranks should be brought up in the same way; and that none should be more favoured in food than another, that they might not, even in their infancy, perceive any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between poverty and riches, but consider each other as equals, and even as brethren, to whom the same portions were assigned, and who, through the course of their lives, were to fare alike: the youths alone were allowed to eat flesh: older men ate their black broth and pulse; the lads slept together in chambers, and after a manner somewhat resembling that still in use in Turkey for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">Janizaries</a>: their beds, in the summer, were very hard, being composed of the reeds plucked by the hand from the banks of the Eurotas: in winter their beds were softer, but by no means downy, or fit to indulge immoderate sleep. They ate altogether in public; and in case any abstained from coming to the tables, they were fined. It was likewise strictly forbidden for any to eat or drink at home before they came to the common meal; even then each\neach had his proper portion, that every thing might be done there with gravity and decency. The black broth was the great rarity of the Spartans, which was composed of salt, vinegar, blood, &c., so that, in our times, it would be esteemed a very unsavoury soup. If they were moderate in their eating, they were so in their drinking also; thirst was the sole measure thereof; and never any Lacedemonian thought of drinking for pleasure: as for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, it was both infamous and severely punished; and, that young men might perceive the reason, slaves were compelled to drink to excess, that the baseness of the vice might appear. When they retired from the public meal, they were not allowed any torches or lights, because it was expected, that men who were perfectly sober should be able to find their way in the dark: and, besides, it gave them a facility of marching without light; a thing wonderfully useful to them in time of war.\n\nVI. As the poor ate as well as the rich, so the rich could wear nothing better than the poor; they neither changed their fashion nor the materials of their garments; they were made for warmth and strength, not for gallantry and show; and to this custom even their kings conformed, who wore nothing gaudy in right of their dignity, but were contented that their virtue should distinguish them rather than their clothes. The youths wore a tunic till they were twelve years old; afterwards they had a cloak given them, which was to serve them a year; and their clothing was, in general, so thin, that a Lacedemonian vest became proverbial. Boys were always used to go without shoes; but when they grew up, they were indulged with them, if the manner of life led required it; but they were always inured to run without them, as also to climb up and slip down steep places with bare feet; nay, the very shoe they used was of a particular form, plain and strong. Boys were not permitted to wear their hair; but when they arrived at the age of twenty, they suffered their hair and beard to grow. Baths and anointing were not much in use among the Lacedemonians; the river Eurotas supplied the former, and exercise the latter. In the field, however, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMPTUARY_LAWS\">sumptuary laws</a> did not take place so strictly as in the city; for when they went to war, they wore purple habits; they put on crowns when they were about to engage the enemy; they had also rings, but they were of iron; which metal was most esteemed by this nation. Young women wore their veils or jerkins only to their knees, or, as some think, not quite so low; a custom which both Greek and Roman authors censure as indecent. Gold, precious stones, and other costly ornaments, were permitted only to common women; which permission was the strongest prohibition to women of virtue, or who affected to be thought virtuous. Virgins went abroad without veils, with which married women, on the contrary were always covered. In certain public exercises, in which girls were admitted as well as boys, they were both obliged to perform naked. Plutarch apologizes for this custom, urging, that there could be no danger from nakedness to the morals of youth whose minds were fortified and habituated to virtue. One of Lycurgus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> views in his institutions, was to eradicate the very seeds of civil dissension in his republic. Hence proceeded the equal division of estates enjoined by him; hence the contempt of wealth, and the neglect of other distinctions, as particularly birth, he considering the people of his whole state as one great family; distinctions which, in other commonwealths, frequently produce tumults and confusions that shake their very foundation.\n\nVII. Though the Spartans were always free, yet it was with this restriction, that they were subservient to their own laws, which bound them as strictly in the city as soldiers, in other states, were bound by the rules of war in the camp. In the first place, strict obedience to their superiors was the great thing required in Sparta. This they looked upon as the very basis of government; without which neither laws nor magistrates availed much. Old age was an indubitable title to honour in Sparta: to the old men the youth role up whenever they came into any public place; they gave way to them when they met them in the streets, and were silent whenever their elders spoke. As all children were looked upon as the children of the state, so all the old men had the authority of parents: they reprehended whatever they saw amiss, not only in their own, but in other people's children: and by this method Lycurgus provided, that as youth are everywhere apt to offend, they might be nowhere without a monitor. The laws went still further: if an old man was present where a young one committed a fault, and did not reprove him, he was punished equally with the delinquent. Amongst the youths there was one of their own body, or at most two years older than the rest, who was styled ir\u00e9n: he had authority to question all their actions, to look strictly to their behaviour, and to punish them if they did amiss; neither were their punishments light, but, on the contrary, very severe; whereby the youth were made hardy, and accustomed to bear stripes and rough usage. Silence was a thing highly commended at Sparta, where modesty was held to be a most becoming virtue in young people; nor was it restrained only to their words and actions, but to their very looks and gestures; Lycurgus having particularly directed, that they should look forward, or on the ground, and that they should always keep their hands within their robes. A stupid inconsiderate person, one who would not listen to instruction, but was careless of whatever the world might lay of him, the Lacedemonians treated as a scandal to human nature; with such a one they would not converse, but threw him off as a rotten-branch and worthless member of society.\n\nVIII. The plainness of their manners, and their being so very much addicted to war, made the Lacedemonians less fond of the sciences than the rest of the Greeks. A soldier was the only reputable profession in Sparta; a mechanic or husbandman was thought a low fellow. The reason of this was, that they imagined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a> which required much labour, some constant posture, being continually in the house, or always about a fire, weakened the body and depressed the mind: whereas a man brought up hardly, was equally fit to attend the service of the republic in time of peace, and to fight its battles when engaged in war. Such occupations as were necessary to be followed for the benefit of the whole, as husbandry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, and the like, were left to their slaves the Helotes; but for curious arts, and such as served only to luxury, they would not so much as suffer them to be introduced in their city; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which, rhetoricians, augurs,\nSparta, bankers, and dealers in money, were shut out. The Spartans admitted not any of the theatrical diversions among them; they would not bear the representation of evil even to produce good; but other kinds of poetry were admitted, provided the magistrates had the perusal of pieces before they were handed to the public.\n\nAbove all things, they affected brevity of speech, and accustomed their children, from their very infancy, never to express themselves in more words than were strictly necessary; whence a concise and sententious oratory is to this day styled Laconic. In writing they used the same conciseness; of which we have a signal instance in a letter of Archidamus to the Eleans, when he understood that they had some thoughts of afflicting the Arcadians. It ran thus: \"Archidamus to the Eleans: It is good to be quiet.\" And therefore Epaminondas thought that he had reason to glory in having forced the Spartans to abandon their monosyllables, and to lengthen their discourses.\n\nThe greatest part of their education consisted in giving their youth right ideas of men and things: the iron or master proposed questions, and either commended the answers that were made him, or reproved such as answered weakly. In these questions, all matters, either of a trivial or arbitrary nature, were equally avoided; and they were confined to such points as were of the highest importance in civil life; such as, Who was the best man in the city? wherein lay the merit of such an action? and, Whether this or that hero's fame was well-founded? Harmless raillery was greatly encouraged; and this, joined to their short manner of speaking, rendered laconic replies universally admired.\n\nMusic was much encouraged; but in this, as in other things, they adhered to that which had been in favour with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; nay, they were so strict therein, that they would not permit their slaves to learn either the tune or the words of their most admired odes; or, which is all one, they would not permit them to sing them if they had learned them. Though the youth of the male sex were much cherished and beloved, as those that were to build up and continue the future glory of the state, yet in Sparta it was a virtuous and modest affection, untinctured with that lasciviousness which was so scandalous at Athens. The good effects of this part of Lycurgus's institutions were seen in the union that reigned among his citizens; and which was so extraordinary, that even in cases of competition, it was hardly known that rivals bore ill-will to each other; but, on the contrary, their love to the same person begat a secondary friendship among themselves, and united them in all things which might be for the benefit of the person beloved.\n\nSome authors have accused this great lawgiver of encouraging theft in his institutions; which, they say, was not held scandalous among the Spartans, if it were so dexterously managed as that the person was not detected in it. But this is certain, and seems to be a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> of the heinous charge, that when a theft was discovered, it was punished with the utmost severity: a person even suspected of it would endure the heaviest punishments rather than acknowledge it, and be branded with so base a crime.\n\nIX. The exercises instituted by law fall under the ninth table. In these all the Greeks were extremely careful, but the Lacedemonians in a degree beyond the rest; for if a youth, by his corpulence, or any other means, became unfit for these exercises, he underwent public contempt at least, if not banishment.\u2014Hunting was the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a> of their children; nay, it was made a part of their education, because it had a tendency to strengthen their limbs, and to render those who practised it supple and fleet: they likewise bred up dogs for hunting with great care. They had a kind of public dances, in which they exceedingly delighted, and which were common alike to virgins and young men: indeed, in all their sports, girls were allowed to divert themselves with the youths: insomuch, that, at darting, throwing the quoit, pitching the bar, and such like robust diversions, the women were as dexterous as the men. For the manifest oddity of this proceeding, Lycurgus assigned no other reason, than that he sought to render women, as well as men, strong and healthy, that the children they brought forth might be so too. Violent exercises, and a laborious kind of life, were only enjoined the youth; for when they were grown up to men's estate, that is, were upwards of 30 years old, they were exempted from all kinds of labour, and employed themselves wholly either in affairs of state or in war. They had a method of whipping, at a certain time, young men in the temple of Diana, and about her altar; which, however palliated, was certainly unnatural and cruel. It was esteemed a great honour to sustain these flagellations without weeping, groaning, or showing any sense of pain; and the thirst of glory was so strong in these young minds, that they very frequently suffered death without shedding a tear or breathing a sigh. A desire of overcoming all the weaknesses of human nature, and thereby rendering his Spartans not only superior to their neighbours, but to their species, runs through many of the institutions of Lycurgus; which principle, if well attended to, thoroughly explains them, and without attending to which it is impossible to give any account of them at all.\n\nX. Gold and silver were, by the constitutions of Money, Lycurgus, made of no value in Sparta. He was so &c. well apprized of the danger of riches, that he made the very possession of them venal; but as there was no living without some sort of money, that is, some common measure or standard of the worth of things, he directed an iron coinage, whereby the Spartans were supplied with the useful money, and at the same time had no temptation to covetousness afforded them; for a very small sum was sufficient to load a couple of horses, and a great one must have been kept in a barn or warehouse. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of all foreign money was also prohibited, that corruption might not enter under the name of commerce. The most ancient method of dealing, viz. by barter, or exchange of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> for another, was preserved by law in Sparta long after it had gone into disuse everywhere else. Interest was a thing forbidden in the Spartan commonwealth; where they had also a law against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a> of lands, accepting presents from foreigners, even without the limits of their own country, and when their authority and character might well seem to excuse them.\n\nXI. Such of the laws of Sparta as related to courts of justice may be brought under the 11th table. Thirty Justice years must have passed over the head of him who had a right to concern himself in juridical proceedings.\nYoung men were thought unfit for them; and it was even held indecent, and of ill report, for a man to have any fondness for law-suits, or to be buying himself at the tribunals, when he had no affairs there of his own. By these rules Lycurgus thought to shut out litigousness, and to prevent that multiplicity of suits which is always scandalous in a state. As young people were not permitted to inquire about the laws of other countries, and as they were hindered from hearing judicial proceedings in their courts, so they were likewise forbidden to ask any questions about, or to endeavour to discover, the reasons of the laws by which themselves were governed. Obedience was their duty; and to that alone they would have them kept. Men of abandoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, or who were notoriously of ill fame, lost all right of giving their votes in respect of public affairs, or of speaking in public assemblies; for they would not believe that an ill man in private life could mean his country better than he did his neighbour.\n\nXII. Till a man was 30 years old, he was not capable of serving in the army, as the best authors agree; though some think that the military age is not well ascertained by ancient writers. They were forbidden to march at any time before the full-moon; the reason of which law is very hard to be discovered, if indeed it had any reason at all, or was not rather founded on some superstitious opinion, that this was a more lucky <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> than any other. They were likewise forbidden to fight often against the same enemy; which was one of the wisest maxims in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> system of Lycurgus: and Agesilaus, by offending against it, destroyed the power of his country, and lost her that authority which for many ages she maintained over the rest of Greece; for, by continually warring against the Thebans, to whom he had an inveterate hatred, he at last beat them into the knowledge of the art of war, and enabled them, under the command of Epaminondas, to maintain for a time the principality of Greece. Maritime affairs they were forbidden to meddle with, though the necessity of things compelled them, in process of time, to transgress this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, and by degrees to transfer to themselves the dominion of the sea as well as of the land: but, after the Peloponnesian war, they again neglected naval affairs from a persuasion that sailors and strangers corrupted those with whom they conversed. As they never fortified Sparta, they were not ready to undertake sieges: fighting in the field was their proper province, and, while they could overcome their enemies there, they rightly conceived that nothing could hurt them at home. In time of war they relaxed somewhat of their strict manner of living, in which they were singular. The true reason for this was, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, that war might be less burdensome to them; for, as we have more than once observed, a strong desire to render them bold and warlike was the reigning passion of their legislator. They were forbidden to remain long encamped in the same place, as well to hinder their being surprized, as that they might be more troublesome to their enemies, by wasting every corner of their country. They slept all night in their armour; but their outguards were not allowed their shields, that, being unprovided of defence, they might not dare to sleep. In all expeditions they were careful in the performance of religious rites; and, after their evening meal was over, the soldiers sung together hymns to their gods. When they were about to engage, the king sacrificed to the mules, that, by their affluence, they might be enabled to perform deeds worthy of being recorded to latest times. Then the army advanced in order to the sound of flutes, which played the hymn of Caius. The king himself sung the paean, which was the signal to charge. This was done with all the solemnity imaginable; and the soldiers were sure either to conquer or die: indeed they had no other choice; for if they fled they were infamous, and in danger of being slain, even by their own mothers, for disgracing their families. In this consisted all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXCELLENCY\">excellency</a> of the Spartan women, who, if possible, exceeded in bravery the men, never lamenting over husbands or sons, if they died honourably in the field; but deploring the shame brought on their house, if either the one or the other escaped by flight. The throwing away a shield also induced infamy; and, with respect to this, mothers, when they embraced their departing sons, were wont to caution them, that they should either return armed as they were, or be brought back to them when they were dead; for, as we have observed, such as were slain in battle were nevertheless buried in their own country. When they made their enemies fly, they pursued no longer than till victory was certain; because they would seem to fight rather for the honour of conquering, than of putting their enemies to death. According to their excellent rules of war, they were bound not to spoil the dead bodies of their enemies; but in process of time, this, and indeed many other of their most excellent regulations, fell into desuetude. He who overcame by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>, offered up an ox to Mars; whereas he who conquered by force, offered up only a cock; the former being esteemed more manly than the latter. After 40 years service, a man was, by law, no longer required to go into the field; and consequently, if the military age was 30, the Spartans were not held invalids till they were 70.","sp":156,"ep":162},{"h":"SPARTANUS","t":"AELIUS, a Latin historian, who wrote the lives of Adrian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARACALLA\">Caracalla</a>, and four other Roman emperors.

See Botany Index.\n\nThe flower buds are in some countries pickled, and eaten as capers; and the seeds have been used as a bad substitute for coffee. The branches are used for making besoms, and tanning leather. They are also used instead of thatch to cover houses. The old wood furnishes the cabinet-maker with beautiful materials for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENEERING\">veneering</a>. The tender branches are in some places mixed with hops for brewing, and the macerated bark may be manufactured into cloth.\n\nThe junceum, or Spanish broom, grows naturally in the southern provinces of France, as well as in other parts of the south of Europe. It grows in the poorest soils, on the steepest declivities of the hills, in a stony soil, where hardly any other plant could vegetate. In a few years it makes a vigorous shrub; infusing its roots between the interstices of the stones, it binds the soil, and retains the small portion of vegetable earth scattered over these hills, which the autumnal rains would otherwise wash away.\nSpartium, wise wash away. It is most easily raised from seed, which is usually sown in January, after the ground has received a slight dressing.\n\nThe shrub serves two useful purposes. Its branches yield a thread of which linen is made, and in winter support sheep and goats.\n\nIn manufacturing thread from broom, the youngest plants are cut in the month of August, or after harvest, and gathered together in bundles, which at first are laid in the sun to dry; they are then beaten with a piece of wood, washed in a river or pond, and left to steep in the water for about four hours. The bundles thus prepared are taken to a little distance from the water, and laid in a hollow place made for them, where they are covered with fern or straw, and remain thus to steep for eight or nine days; during which time, all that is necessary, is to throw a little water once a day on the heap, without uncovering the broom. After this, the bundles are well washed, the green rind of the plant or epidermis comes off, and the fibrous part remains; each bundle is then beaten with a wooden hammer upon a stone, to detach all the threads, which are at the same time carefully drawn to the extremity of the branches. After this operation, the faggots are untied, and spread upon stones or rocks till they are dry. The twigs must not be peeled till they are perfectly dry; they are then dressed with the comb, and the threads are separated according to the fineness, and spun upon a wheel.\n\nThe linen made of this thread serves various purposes in rural economy. The coarsest is employed in making sacks and other strong cloths for carrying grain or seeds. Of the finest is made bed, table, and body linen. The peasants in several places use no other, for they are unacquainted with the culture of hemp or flax, their soil being too dry and too barren for raising them. The cloth made with the thread of the broom is very useful; it is as soft as that made of hemp; and it would perhaps look as well as that made of flax if it was more carefully spun. It becomes white in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as it is steeped. The price of the finest thread, when it is sold, which seldom happens, is generally about a shilling a pound.\n\nThe other use to which this broom is applied, is to maintain sheep and goats during winter. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol9.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a> these animals have no other food from November to April, except the leaves of trees preserved. The branches of this broom therefore are a resource the more precious, that it is the only fresh nourishment which at that season the flocks can procure, and they prefer it at all times to every other plant. In fine weather the sheep are led out to feed on the broom where it grows; but in bad weather the shepherds cut the branches, and bring them to the sheep folds. There is, however, an inconvenience attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> use of this food. It generally produces inflammation in the urinary passages. But this inconvenience is easily removed by cooling drink, or a change of food, or by mixing the broom with something else.\n\nIt is perhaps needless to add, that it differs much from the broom that is common everywhere in the north of Europe, though this too, in many places, is used for food to cattle. Both of them produce flowers that are very much resorted to by bees, as they contain a great quantity of honey juice. And this should be another inducement to the cultivation of the Spanish broom.","sp":162,"ep":163},{"h":"SPARUS","t":"GILTHEAD, a genus of fishes belonging to the order of thoracici.

By specific medicines we understand such medicines as are found to be more uniform in their effects than others in any particular disorder.\n\nSPECIFIC Gravity, is a term much employed in the discussions of modern physics. It expresses the weight of any particular kind of matter, as compared with the weight of the same bulk of some other body of which the weight is supposed to be familiarly known, and is therefore taken for the standard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. The body generally made use of for this purpose is pure water.\n\nThe specific gravity of bodies is a very interesting question both to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and to the man of business. The philosopher considers the weights of bodies as measures of the number of material atoms, or the quantity of matter which they contain. This he does on the supposition that every atom of matter is of the same weight, whatever may be its sensible form. This supposition, however, is made by him with caution, and he has recourse to specific gravity for ascertaining its truth in various ways. This shall be considered by and by. The man of business entertains no doubt of the matter, and proceeds on it as a sure guide in his most interesting transactions. We measure commodities of various kinds by tons, pounds, and ounces, in the same manner as we measure them by yards, feet, and inches, or by bushels, gallons, and pints; nay, we do this with much greater confidence, and prefer this measurement to all others, whenever we are much interested to know the exact proportions of matter that bodies contain. The weight of a quantity of grain is allowed to inform us much more exactly of its real quantity of useful matter than the most accurate measure of its bulk. We see many circumstances which can vary the bulk of a quantity of matter, and these are frequently such as we cannot regulate or prevent; but we know very few indeed that can make any sensible change in this weight without the addition or abstraction of other matter. Even taking it to the summit of a high mountain, or from the equator to the polar region, will make no change in its weight as it is ascertained by the balance, because there is the same real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of weight in the pounds and ounces used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.\n\nNotwithstanding the unavoidable change which heat and cold make in the bulk of bodies, and the permanent varieties of the same kind of matter which are caused by different circumstances of growth, texture, &c., most kinds of matter have a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> in the density of their particles, and therefore in the weight of a given bulk. Thus the purity of gold, and its degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULTERATION\">adulteration</a>, may be inferred from its weight, it being purer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as it is more dense. The density, therefore, of different kinds of tangible matter becomes characteristic of the kind, and a test of its purity; it marks a particular appearance in which matter exists, and may therefore be called, with propriety, SPECIFIC.\n\nBut this density cannot be directly observed. It is not by comparing the dilutions between the atoms of matter in gold and in water that we say the first is 19 times denser than the last, and that an inch of gold contains 19 times as many material atoms as an inch of water; we reckon on the equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a> of every atom of matter, whether of gold or of water; therefore the weight of any body becomes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of its material density, and the weight of a given bulk becomes specific of that kind of matter, marking its kind, and even ascertaining its purity in this form.\n\nIt is evident that, in order to make this comparison of generality, the standard must be familiarly known, and must be very uniform in its density, and the comparison of bulk and density must be easy and accurate. The most obvious method would be to form, with all nicety, a piece of the standard matter of some convenient bulk, and to weigh it very exactly, and keep a note of its weight; then, to make the comparison of any other substance, it must be made into a mass of the same precise bulk, and weighed with equal care; and the most convenient way of expressing the specific gravity would be to consider the weight of the standard as unity, and then the number expressing the specific gravity is the number of times that the weight of the standard is contained in that of the other substance. This comparison is most easily and accurately made in fluids. We have only to make a vessel of known dimensions equal to that of the standard which we employ, and to weigh it when empty, and then when filled with the fluid. Nay, the most difficult part of the process, the making a vessel of the precise dimensions of the standard, may be avoided, by using some fluid substance for a standard. Any vessel will then do; and we may ensure very great accuracy by using a vessel with a slender neck, such as a phial or matrix; for when this is filled to a certain mark in the neck, any error in the estimation by the eye will bear a very small proportion to the whole. The weight of the standard fluid which fills it to this mark being carefully ascertained, is kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>. The specific gravity of any other fluid is had by weighing the contents of this vessel when filled with it, and dividing\ndividing the weight by the weight of the standard. The quotient is the specific gravity of the fluid. But in all other cases this is a very difficult problem: it requires very nice hands, and an accurate eye, to make two bodies of the same bulk. An error of one hundredth part in the linear dimensions of a solid body makes an error of a 30th part in its bulk; and bodies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> shapes and friable substance, such as the ores of metals, cannot be brought into convenient and exact dimensions for measurement.\n\nFrom all these inconveniences and difficulties we are freed by the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, who, from the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a> discovered or established by him, deduced the accurate and easy method which is now universally practised for discovering the specific gravity and density of bodies. (See Archimedes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a>). Instead of measuring the bulk of the body by that of the displaced fluid (which would have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for Archimedes to do with anything like the necessary precision), we have only to observe the loss of weight sustained by the fluid. This can be done with great ease and exactness. Whatever may be the bulk of the body, this loss of weight is the weight of an equal bulk of the fluid; and we obtain the specific gravity of the body by simply dividing its whole weight by the weight lost: the quotient is the specific gravity when this fluid is taken for the standard, even though we should not know the absolute weight of any given bulk of this standard. It also gives us an easy and accurate method of ascertaining even this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> point. We have only to form any solid body into an exact cube, sphere, or prism, of known dimensions, and observe what weight it loses when immersed in this standard fluid. This is the weight of the same bulk of the standard to be kept in remembrance; and thus we obtain, by the bye, a most easy and accurate method for measuring the bulk or solid contents of any body, however irregular its shape may be. We have only to see how much weight it loses in the standard fluid; we can compute what quantity of the standard fluid will have this weight. Thus should we find that a quantity of sand, or a furze bush, loses 250 ounces when immersed in pure water, we learn by this that the solid measure of every grain of the sand, or of every twig and prickle of the furze, when added into one lump, amounts to the fourth part of a cubic foot, or to 432 cubic inches.\n\nTo all these advantages of the Archimedean method of ascertaining the specific gravity of bodies, derived from his hydrostatic doctrines and discoveries, we may add, that the immediate standard of comparison, namely, water, is, of all the substances that we know, the fittest for the purpose of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> standard of reference. In its ordinary natural state it is sufficiently constant and uniform in its weight for every examination where the utmost mathematical accuracy is not wanted; all its variations arise from impurities, from which it may at all times be separated by the simple process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>: and we have every reason to think that when pure, its density, when of the same temperature, is invariable.\n\nWater is therefore universally taken for the unit of that scale on which we measure the specific gravity of bodies, and its weight is called 1. The specific gravity of any other body is the real weight in pounds and ounces, when of the bulk of one pound or one ounce of water. It is therefore of the first importance, in all discussions respecting the specific gravity of bodies, to have the precise weight of some known bulk of pure water. We have taken some pains to examine and compare the experiments on this subject, and shall endeavour to ascertain this point with the precision which it deserves. We shall reduce all to the English cubic foot and avoirdupois ounce of the Exchequer standard, on account of a very convenient circumstance peculiar to this unit, viz. that a cubic foot contains almost precisely a thousand ounces of pure water, so that the specific gravity of bodies expresses the number of such ounces contained in a cubic foot.\n\nWe begin with a trial made before the house of commons in 1666 by Mr Everard. He weighed 214.56 cubic inches of water by a balance, which turned tensibly with 6 grains, when there were 30 pounds in each scale. The weights employed were the troy weights, in the deposit of the Court of Exchequer, which are still preserved, and have been most scrupulously examined and compared with each other. The weight was 1132 ounces 14 pennyweights. This wants just 11 grains of a thousand avoirdupois ounces for 1728 cubic inches, or a cubic foot; and it would have amounted to that weight had it been a degree or two colder. The temperature indeed is not mentioned; but as the trial was made in a comfortable room, we may presume the temperature to have been about 55\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer. The dimensions of the vessel were as accurate as the nice hand of Mr Abraham Sharp, Mr Flamstead's assistant at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>, could execute, and it was made by the Exchequer standard of length.\n\nThis is confirmed by the naturalists of Europe as a very accurate standard experiment, and it is confirmed by many others both private and public. The standards of weight and capacity employed in the experiment are still in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, and publicly known, by the report of the Royal Society to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> in 1742, and by the report of a committee of the house of commons in 1758. This gives it a superiority over all the measures which have come to our knowledge.\n\nThe first experiment, made with proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, that we meet with, is by the celebrated Snellius, about the year 1615, and related in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ERATOSTHENES\">Eratosthenes</a> Batavus. He weighed a Rhineland cubic foot of distilled water, and found it 62.79 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> pounds. If this was the ordinary weight of the shops, containing 7626 English troy grains, the English cubic foot would be 62 pounds 9 ounces, only one ounce more than by Everard's experiment. If it was the Mint pound, the weight was 62 pounds 6 ounces. The only other trials which can come into competition with Mr Everard's are some made by the Academy of Sciences at Paris. Picart, in 1691, found the Paris cubic foot of the water of the fountain d'Arcueil to weigh 69.588 pounds, poids de Paris. Du Hamel obtained the very same result; but Mr Monge, in 1783, says that filtered rain-water of the temperature 12\u00b0 (Reaumur) weighs 69.3792. Both these measures are considerably below Mr Everard's, which is 62.5; the former giving 62.053, and the latter 61.868. M. Lavoisier states the Paris cubic foot at 70 pounds, which makes the English foot 62.47. But there is an inconstancy...\nSpecific Gravity.\n\nSome changes were made in 1688, by royal authority, in the national standards, both of weight and length; and the academicians are exceedingly puzzled to this day in reconciling the differences, and cannot even ascertain with perfect assurance the linear measures which were employed in their most boasted geodetical operations.\n\nSuch variations in the measurements made by persons of reputation for judgement and accuracy engaged the writer of this article some years ago to attempt another. A vessel was made of a cylindrical form, as being more easily executed with accuracy, whose height and diameter were 6 inches, taken from a most accurate copy of the Exchequer standard. It was weighed in distilled water of the temperature $35^\\circ$ several times without varying 2 grains, and it lost $4289.5$ grains. This gives for the cubic foot $998.74$ ounces, deficient from Mr Everard's an ounce and a quarter; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> which may be expected, since Mr Everard used the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RIVER_WATER\">River water</a> without distillation.\n\nWe hope that these observations will not be thought superfluous in a matter of such continual reference, in the most interesting questions both to the philosopher and the man of business; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> which we have given will be considered as sufficiently authenticated.\n\nLet us, therefore, for the future take water for the standard, and suppose that, when of the ordinary temperature of summer, and in its state of greatest natural purity, viz. in clean rain or snow, an English cubic foot of it weighs a thousand avoirdupois ounces of $437.5$ troy grains each. Divide the weight of any body by the weight of an equal bulk of water, the quotient is the specific gravity of that body; and if the three first figures of the decimal be accounted integers, the quotient is the number of avoirdupois ounces in a cubic foot of the body. Thus the specific gravity of the very finest gold which the refiner can produce is $19.365$, and a cubic foot of it weighs $1936.5$ ounces.\n\nBut an important remark must be made here. All bodies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a> or unorganized texture expand by heat, and contract by cooling. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> by the same change of temperature is very different in different bodies. Thus water, when heated from $60^\\circ$ to $100^\\circ$, increases its volume nearly $\\frac{1}{8}$ of its bulk, and mercury only $\\frac{1}{27}$, and many substances much less. Hence it follows, that an experiment determines the specific gravity only in that very temperature in which the bodies are examined. It will therefore be proper always to note this temperature; and it will be convenient to adopt some very useful temperature for such trials in general: perhaps about $60^\\circ$ of Fahrenheit's thermometer is as convenient as any. It may always be procured in these climates without inconvenience. A temperature near to freezing would have some advantages, because water changes its bulk very little between the temperature $32^\\circ$ and $45^\\circ$. But this temperature cannot always be obtained. It will much conduce to the facility of the comparison to know the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> which heat produces on pure water. The following table, taken from the observations of Dr Blagden and Mr Gilpin (Phil. Trans. 1792) will answer this purpose.\n\n| Temperature of Water | Bulk of Water | Specific Gravity |\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| 30                   | 99910         | 1.00090         |\n| 35                   | 99970         | 1.00094         |\n| 40                   | 99914         | 1.00086         |\n| 45                   | 99932         | 1.00068         |\n| 50                   | 99962         | 1.00038         |\n| 55                   | 100000        | 1.00000         |\n| 60                   | 100050        | 0.99950         |\n| 65                   | 100106        | 0.99804         |\n| 70                   | 100171        | 0.99830         |\n| 75                   | 100242        | 0.99759         |\n| 80                   | 100320        | 0.99681         |\n| 85                   | 100404        | 0.99598         |\n| 90                   | 100501        | 0.99502         |\n| 95                   | 100602        | 0.99402         |\n| 100                  |               |                 |\n\nThose gentlemen observed the expansion of water to be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANOMALOUS\">anomalous</a> between $32^\\circ$ and $45^\\circ$. This is distinctly seen during the gradual cooling of water to the point of freezing. It contracts for a while, and then suddenly expands. But we seldom have occasion to measure specific gravities in such temperature.\n\nThe reader is now sufficiently acquainted with the principles of this hydrostatic method of determining the specific gravity of bodies, and can judge of the propriety of the forms which may be proposed for the experiment.\n\nThe specific gravity of a fluid may be determined either by filling it with a vessel with a narrow neck, or by weighing a solid body that is immersed in it. It is hard to say which is the best way. The last is not subject to any error in filling, because we may suspend the solid by a fine wire, which will not displace any sensible quantity of the fluid; and if the solid is but a little heavier than the fluid, the balance being loaded only with the excess, will be very sensible to the smallest want of equilibrium. But this advantage is perhaps compensated by an obstruction to the motion of the solid up or down in the fluid, arising from viscosity. When the weight in the opposite scale is yet too small, we slowly add more, and at last grain by grain, which gradually brings the beam to the level. When it is exactly level, the weight in the scale is somewhat too great; for it not only balances the preponderance of the solid, but also this viscosity of the fluid. But we may get rid of this error. Add a small quantity more; this will bring the beam over to the other side. Now put as much into the scale on the same side with the solid; this will not restore the beam to its level. We must add more till this be accomplished; and this addition is the measure of the viscosity of the fluid, and must be subtracted from the weight that was in the other scale when the beam came first to a level. This effect of viscosity is not insensible, with nice apparatus, even in the purest water, and in many fluids it is very considerable\u2014and, what is worse, it is very changeable. It is greatly diminished by heat; and this is an additional reason for making\nmaking those trials in pretty warm temperatures. But for fluids of which the viscidity is considerable, this method is by no means proper; and we must take the other, and weigh them in a vessel with a narrow neck. Mercury must also be treated in this way, because we have no solid that will sink in it but gold and platinum.\n\nIt is not so easy as one would imagine to fill a vessel precisely to the same degree upon every trial. But if we do not operate on too small quantities, the unavoidable error may be made altogether insignificant, by having the neck of the vessel very small. If the vessel hold a pound of water, and the neck do not exceed a quarter of an inch (and it will not greatly retard the operation to have it half this size), the examiner must be very careless indeed to err one part in two thousand; and this is perhaps as near as we can come with a balance. We must always recollect that the capacity of the vessel changes by heat, and we must know this variation, and take it into the account. But it is afflicting to regard (as Mr Homberg would make us believe that he did) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the vessel by the pressure of the fluid. His experiments of this kind have by no means the consistence with each other that should convince us that he did not commit much greater errors than what arose from diffusion.\n\nIn examining either solids or fluids, we must be careful to free their surface, or that of the vessel in which the fluid is to be weighed, from air, which frequently adheres to it in a peculiar manner, and, by forming a bubble, increases the apparent bulk of the solid, or diminishes the capacity of the vessel. The greatest part of what appears on those occasions seems to have existed in the fluid in a state of chemical union, and to be set at liberty by the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the fluid for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> solid body. These air bubbles must be carefully brushed off by hand. All greasy matters must be cleared off for the same reason: they prevent the fluid from coming into contact.\n\nWe must be no less careful that no water is imbibed by the solid, which would increase its weight without increasing its bulk. In some cases, however, a very long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a> and imbibition is necessary. Thus, in examining the specific gravity of the fibrous part of vegetables, we should err exceedingly if we imagined it as small as appears at first. We believe that in most plants it is at least as great as water, for after long maceration they sink in it.\n\nIt is almost needless to say that the nicest and most sensible balances are necessary for this examination. Balances are even constructed for purpose, and fitted with several pieces of apparatus, which make the examination easy and neat. We have described (see Balance) Mr Graveande's as one of the most convenient of any. His contrivance for observing the fractions of a grain is extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and expeditious, especially for detecting the effect of viscidity.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HYDROMETER\">hydrometer</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-AREOMETER\">areometer</a>, is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for ascertaining the specific gravity of fluids. This very pretty instrument is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of a lady, as eminent for intellectual accomplishments as she was admired for her beauty. Hypatia, the learned daughter of the celebrated mathematician Theon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, became so eminent for her mathematical knowledge, that she was made public professor of the science in the first school in the world. She wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on the works of Apollonius and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a>, and composed Astronomical Tables; all of which are lost. These rare accomplishments, however, could not save her from the fury of the fanatics of Alexandria, who cut her in pieces for having taken an offensive part in a dispute between the governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>.\u2014We have described some of the most approved of these instruments in the article Hydrometer, and shall in this place make a few observations on the principles of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, not as they are usually made, accommodated to the examination of particular liquors, but as indicators of pure specific gravity. And we must premise, that this would, for many reasons, be the best way of constructing them. The very ingenious contrivances for accommodating them to particular purposes are unavoidably attended with many sources of error, both in their adjustment by the maker and in their use; and all that is gained by a very expensive instrument is the saving the trouble of inspecting a table. A simple scale of specific gravity would expose to no error in construction, because all the weights but one, or all the points of the scale but one, are to be obtained by calculation, which is incomparably more exact than any manual operation, and the table can always be more exact than any complex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. But a still greater advantage is, that the instruments would by this means be fitted for examining all liquors whatever, whereas at present they are almost useless for any but the one for which they are constructed.\n\nHydrometers are of two kinds. The most simple and the most delicate are just a substitute for the hydrostatic balance. They consist of a ball (or rather an egg or pear-shaped vessel, which moves more easily through the fluid) A (fig. 1.) having a foot projecting down from it, terminated by another ball B, and a slender stalk or wire above, carrying a little dish C. The whole is made so light as to float in the lightest fluid we are acquainted with; such as vitriolic or muriatic ether, whose specific gravity is only 0.73. This number should be marked on the dish, indicating that this is the specific gravity of the fluid in which the instrument floats, sinking to the point D of the stem. The ball B is made heavy, and the foot is of some length, that the instrument may have stability, and swim erect, even if considerably loaded above; and, for the same reason, it must be made very round, otherwise it will lean to a side. When put into a heavier liquor, its buoyancy will cause it to float with a part of the ball above the surface. Weights are now put into the scale C, till the instrument sinks to D. The weight put into the scale, added to the weight of the instrument, is the weight of the displaced fluid. This, compared with the weight of the whole when the instrument is swimming in pure water, gives the specific gravity of the fluid. All trouble of calculation may be avoided by marking the weights with such numbers as shall indicate the specific gravity at once. Thus having loaded the instrument so as to sink it to D in pure water, call the whole weight 1000; then weigh the instrument itself, and say, \"as the weight when swimming in water is to its present weight, so is 1000 to a 4th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>.\" This is the specific gravity of the liquor which would float the unloaded instrument. Suppose this to be 730. The hydrometer would just float in muriatic ether, and this should be marked on the side. Now make a set of small weights,\nSpecific weights, and mark them, not by their weights in grains, but in such units that 275 of them shall be equal to the weight which fits the instrument for pure water.\n\nSuppose that, in order to float this instrument in a certain brandy, there are required 186 in these small weights. This added to 735 gives 916 for the specific gravity, and shows it to be precisely exactly proof spirit. Nine weights, viz. 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, will suffice for all liquors from ether to the strongest wine. And that the trouble in changing the weights may be greatly lessened, let a few circles \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) be marked on the top of the ball. When we see it float unloaded at the circle C for instance, we know it will require at least 128 to sink it to D on the stem.\n\nIf the weights to be added above are considerable, it raises the centre of gravity so much, that a small want of equilibrium, by laying the weights on one side, will produce a great inclination of the instrument, which is unsightly. Instead therefore of making them loose weights, it is proper to make them round plates, with a small hole in the middle, to go on a pin in the middle of the scale. This will keep the instrument always upright. But unless the hydrometer is of a considerable size, it can hardly be made so as to extend from the lightest to the heaviest fluid which we may have occasion to examine, even though we except mercury. Some of the mineral acids are considerably more than twice the weight of ether. When there is such a load at top, the hydrometer is very apt to overturn, and inclines with the smallest want of equilibrium. Great size is inconvenient even to the philosopher, because it is not always in his power to operate on a quantity of fluid sufficient to float the instrument. Therefore two, or perhaps three, are necessary for general examination. One may reach from ether to water; another may serve for all liquors of a specific gravity between one and one and a half; and the third, for the mineral acids, may reach from this to two. If each of these be about two solid inches in capacity, we may easily and expeditiously determine the specific gravity within one ten thousandth part of the truth: and this is precision enough for most purposes of science or business.\n\nThe chief questions are, 1. To ascertain the specific gravity of an unknown fluid. This needs no farther explanation. 2. To ascertain the proportion of two fluids which are known to be in a mixture. This is done by discovering the specific gravity of the mixture by means of the hydrometer, and then deducing the proportion from a comparison of this with the specific gravities of the ingredients.\n\nIn this mode of examination the bulk is always the same; for the hydrometer is immersed in the different fluids to the same depth. Now if an inch, for example, of this bulk is made up of the heaviest fluid, there is an inch wanting of the lightest; and the change made in the weight of the mixture is the difference between the weight of an inch of the heaviest, and of an inch of the lightest ingredients. The number of inches therefore of the heaviest fluid is proportional to the addition made to the weight of the mixture. Therefore let B and b be the bulks of the heaviest and lightest fluids in the bulk \\(b\\) of the mixture; and let D, d, and \\(d'\\) be the densities, or the weights, or the specific gravities (for they are in one ratio) of the heavy fluid, the light fluid, and the mixture (their bulk being that of the hydrometer). We have \\(b = B + b\\). The addition which would have been made to the bulk \\(b\\), if the lightest fluid were changed entirely for the heaviest, would be \\(D - d\\); and the change which is really made is \\(d' - d\\). Therefore \\(b : b' = D - d : d' - d\\); or, in words, \"the difference between the specific gravities of the two fluids, is to the difference between the specific gravities of the mixture and of the lightest fluid, as the bulk of the whole to the bulk of the heaviest contained in the mixture?\" and \"the difference of the specific gravities of the two fluids, is to the difference of the specific gravities of the mixture and of the heaviest fluids, as the bulk of the whole to that of the lightest contained in the mixture.\" This is the form in which the ordinary benefits of life requires the answer to be expressed, because we generally reckon the quantity of liquors by bulk, in gallons, pints, quarts. But it would have been equally easy to have obtained the answer in pounds and ounces; or it may be had from their bulk, since we know their specific gravities.\n\nThe hydrometer more commonly used is the ancient one of Hypatia, consisting of a ball A (fig. 2.) made steady by an addition B, below it like the former, but having a long stem CF above. It is so loaded that it sinks to the top F of the stem in the lightest of all the fluids which we propose to measure with it, and to sink only to C in the heaviest. In a fluid of intermediate specific gravity it will sink to some point between C and F.\n\nIn this form of the hydrometer the weight is always the same, and the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> given by the instrument is that of different bulks with equal weight. Because the instrument sinks till the bulk of the displaced fluid equals it in weight, and the additions to the displaced fluid are all made by the stem, it is evident that equal bulks of the fluid indicate equal additions of volume. Thus the stem becomes a scale of bulks to the same weight.\n\nThe only form in which the stem can be made with sufficient accuracy is cylindrical or prismatical. Such a stem may be made in the most accurate manner by wire-drawing, that is, passing it through a hole made in a hardened steel plate. If such a stem be divided into equal parts, it becomes a scale of bulks in arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>. This is the easiest and most natural division of the scale; but it will not indicate densities, specific gravities, or weights of the same bulk in arithmetical progression. The specific gravity is as the weight divided by the bulk. Now a series of divisors (the bulks), in arithmetical progression, applied to the same dividend (the bulk and weight of the hydrometer as it floats in water), will not give a series of quotients (the specific gravities) in arithmetical progression: they will be in what is called harmonic progression, their differences continually diminishing. This will appear even when physically considered. When the hydrometer sinks a tenth of an inch near the top of the stem, it displaces one tenth of an inch of a light fluid, compared with that displaced by it when it is floating with all the stem above the surface. In order therefore that the divisions of the stem may indicate equal changes of specific gravity, they must be in a series of harmonic progressions increasing. The point at which the instrument floats in pure water should be marked 1000, and those above it 999, 998, 997, &c.; and those\nSpecific Gravity.\n\nthose below the water mark must be numbered 1001, 1002, 1003, &c. Such a scale will be a very apposite picture of the densities of fluids, for the density or vicinity of the divisions will be precisely similar to the density of the fluids. Each interval is a bulk of fluid of the same weight. If the whole instrument were drawn out into wire of the size of the stem, the length from the water mark would be 1000.\n\nSuch are the rules by which the scale must be divided. But there must be some points of it determined by experiment, and it will be proper to take them as remote from each other as possible. For this purpose let the instrument be accurately marked at the point where it stands, in two fluids, differing as much in specific gravity as the instrument will admit. Let it also be marked where it stands in water. Then determine with the utmost precision the specific gravities of these fluids, and put their values at the corresponding points of the scale. Then the intermediate points of the scale must be computed for the different intervening specific gravities, or it must be divided from a pattern scale of harmonic progressions in a way well known to the mathematical instrument-makers. If the specific gravities have been accurately determined, the value 1000 will be found to fall precisely in the water mark. If we attempt the division entirely by experiment, by making a number of fluids of different specific gravities, and marking the stem as it stands in them, we shall find the divisions turn out very anomalous. This is however the way usually practised; and there are few hydrometers, even from the best maker, that hold true to a single division or two. Yet the method by computation is not more troublesome; and one scale of harmonic progressions will serve to divide every stem that offers. We may make use of a scale of equal parts for the stem, with the affluence of two little tables. One of these contains the specific gravities in harmonic progression, corresponding to the arithmetical scale of bulks on the stem of the hydrometer; the other contains the divisions and fractions of a division of the scale of bulks, which correspond to an arithmetical scale of specific gravities. We believe this to be the best method of all. The scale of equal parts on the stem is so easily made, and the little table is so easily inspected, that it has every advantage of accuracy and dispatch, and it gives, by the way, an amusing view of the relation of the bulks and densities.\n\nWe have hitherto supposed a scale extending from the lightest to the heaviest fluid. But unless it be of a very inconvenient length, the divisions must be very minute. Moreover, when the bulk of the stem bears a great proportion to that of the body, the instrument does not swim steadily; it is therefore proper to limit the range of the instrument in the same manner as those of the first kind.\n\nA range from the density of ether to that of water may be very well executed in an instrument of very moderate size, and two others will do for all the heavier liquids; or an equal range in any other densities as may suit the usual occupations of the experimenter.\n\nTo avoid the inconveniences of a hydrometer with a very long and slender stem, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of having a series of them, a third fort has been contrived, in which the principles of both are combined. Suppose a hydrometer with a stem, whose bulk is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of that of the ball, and that it sinks in ether to the top of the stem; it is evident that in a fluid which is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th heavier, the whole stem will emerge; for the bulk of the displaced fluid is now \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of the whole leaf, and the weight is the same as before, and therefore the specific gravity is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th greater.\n\nThus we have obtained a hydrometer which will indicate, by means of divisions marked on the stem, all specific gravities from 0.73 to 0.833; for 0.833 is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th greater than 0.73. These divisions must be made in harmonic progression, as before directed for an entire scale, placing 0.73 at the top of the stem and 0.833 at the bottom.\n\nWhen it floats at the lowest division, a weight may be put on the top of the stem, which will again sink it to the top. This weight must evidently be 0.073, or \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of the weight of the fluid displaced by the unloaded instrument. The hydrometer, thus loaded, indicates the same specific gravity, by the top of the stem, that the unloaded instrument indicates by the lowest division. Therefore, when loaded, it will indicate another series of specific gravities, from 0.833 to 0.8833 (\\( =0.833 + 0.0833 \\)), and will float in a liquor of the specific gravity 0.8833 with the whole stem above the surface.\n\nIn like manner, if we take off this weight, and put on \\( r = 0.0833 \\), it will sink the hydrometer to the top of the stem; and with this new weight it will indicate another series of specific gravities from 0.8833 to 0.97163 (\\( =0.8833 + 0.08833 \\)). And, in the same manner, a third weight \\( = 0.8833 \\) will again sink it to the top of the stem, and fit it for another series of specific gravities up to 1.068793. And thus, with three weights, we have procured a hydrometer fitted for all liquors from ether to a wort for a malt liquor of two barrels per quarter. Another weight, in the same progression, will extend the instrument to the strongest wort that is brewed.\n\nThis is a very commodious form of the instrument, and is now in very general use for examining spirituous liquors, worts, ale, brines, and many such articles of commerce. But the divisions of the scale are generally adapted to the questions which naturally occur in the business. Thus, in the commerce of strong liquors, it is usual to estimate the article by the quantity of spirit of a certain strength which the liquor contains.\u2014This we have been accustomed to call proof spirit, and it is such that a wine gallon weighs 7 pounds 12 ounces; and it is by this strength that the excise duties are levied. Therefore the divisions on the scale, and the weights which connect the successive repetitions of the scale, are made to express at once the number of gallons or parts of a gallon of proof spirits contained in a gallon of the liquor. Such instruments save all trouble of calculation to the exciseman or dealer; but they limit the use of a very delicate and expensive instrument to a very narrow employment. It would be much better to adhere to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> either of specific gravity or of bulk; and then a very small table, which could be comprised in the smallest case for the instrument, might render it applicable to every kind of fluid.\n\nThe reader cannot but have observed that the successive weights, by which the float scale of the instrument is extended to a great range of specific gravities, do not increase by equal quantities. Each difference is the weight of the liquor displaced by the graduated stem of the instrument when it is sunk to the top of\nSpecific Gravity.\n\nIt is a determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALIQUOT_PART\">aliquot part</a> of the whole weight of the instrument so loaded, (in our example it is always \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)th of it). It increases therefore in the same proportion with the preceding weight of the loaded instrument. In short, both the successive additions, and the whole weights of the loaded instrument, are quantities in geometrical progression; and, in like manner, the divisions on the scale, if they correspond to equal differences of specific gravity, must also be unequal\u2014This is not sufficiently attended to by the makers; and they commit an error here, which is very considerable when the whole range of the instrument is great. For the value of one division of the scale, when the largest weight is on, is as much greater than its value, when the instrument is not loaded at all, as the full loaded instrument is heavier than the instrument unloaded. No manner whatever of dividing the scale will correspond to equal differences of specific gravity through the whole range with different weights; but if the divisions are made to indicate equal proportions of gravity when the instrument is used without a weight, they will indicate equal proportions throughout. This is evident from what we have been just now saying; for the proportion of the specific gravities corresponding to any two immediately succeeding weights is always the same.\n\nThe best way, therefore, of constructing the instrument, so that the same divisions of the scale may be accurate in all its successive repetitions with the different weights, is to make these divisions in geometrical progression. The corresponding specific gravities will also be in geometric proportion. These being all inferred in a table, we obtain them with no more trouble than by inspecting the scale which usually accompanies the hydrometer. This table is of the most easy construction; for the ratio of the successive bulks and specific gravities being all equal, the differences of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> are equal.\n\nThis will be illustrated by applying it to the example already given of a hydrometer extending from 0.73 to 1.068793 with three weights. This gives four repetitions of the scale on the stem. Suppose this scale divided into 10 parts, we have 40 specific gravities\u2014Let these be indicated by the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, &c., to 40. The mark 0 is affixed to the top of the stem, and the divisions downwards are marked 1, 2, 3, &c., the lowest being 10. These divisions are easily determined. The stem, which we may suppose 5 inches long, was supposed to be \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)th of the capacity of the ball. It may therefore be considered as the extremity of a rod of 11 times its length, or 55 inches; and we must find nine mean proportions between 50 and 55 inches. Subtract each of these from 55 inches, and the remainders are the distances of the points of division from 0, the top of the scale. The smallest weight is marked 10, the next 20, and the third 30. If the instrument loaded with the weight 20 sinks in some liquor to the mark 7, it indicates the specific gravity 27, that is, the \\(27^{th}\\) of 40 mean proportions between 0.73 and 1.068793, or 0.944242. To obtain all these intermediate specific gravities, we have only to subtract\n\n\\[\n9.8633229, \\text{ the logarithm of } 0.73, \\text{ from that of } 1.068793, \\text{ viz. } 0.0288037, \\text{ and take } 0.0041393, \\text{ the } 40^{th} \\text{ part of the difference. Multiply this by } 1, 2, 3, \\text{ &c., and add the logarithm of } 0.73 \\text{ to each of the products.}\n\\]\n\nThe sums are the logarithms of the specific gravities required. These will be found to proceed equably, that they may be interpolated ten times by a simple table of proportional parts without the smallest sensible error. Therefore the item may be divided into a hundred parts very sensible to the eye (each being nearly the 20th of an inch), and 406 degrees of specific gravity obtained within the range, which is as near as we can examine this matter by any hydrometer. Thus the specific gravities corresponding to No 26, 27, 28, 29, are as follow:\n\n|   | 1st Diff. | 2nd Diff. |\n|---|----------|-----------|\n| 26 | 0.93529  | 895       |\n| 27 | 0.94424  | 924       |\n| 28 | 0.95328  | 953       |\n| 29 | 0.96241  |           |\n\nNay, the trouble of inspecting a table may be avoided, by forming on a scale the logarithms of the numbers between 7300 and 1068793, and placing alongside of it a scale of the same length divided into 400 equal parts, numbered from 0 to 400. Then, looking for the mark shown by the hydrometer on this scale of equal parts, we see opposite to it the specific gravity.\n\nWe have been thus particular in the illustration of this mode of construction, because it is really a beautiful and commodious instrument, which may be of great use both to the naturalist and to the man of business.\u2014A table may be comprised in 20 octavo pages, which will contain the specific gravities of every fluid which can interest either, and answer every question relative to their admixture with as much precision as the observations can be made. We therefore recommend it to our readers, and we recommend the very example which we have given as one of the most convenient. The instrument need not exceed eight inches in length, and may be contained in a pocket case of two inches broad and as many deep, which will also contain the scale, a thermometer, and even the table for applying it to all fluids which have been examined.\n\nIt is unfortunate that no graduated hydrometer can be made so easily for the examination of the corrosive mineral acids (A). These must be made of glass, and we cannot depend on the accurate cylindric form of any glass item. But if any such can be procured, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> is the same. The divided scale may either be on thin paper pasted on the inside of the item, or it may be printed on the item itself from a plate, with ink made of a metallic calx, which will attach itself to the glass with a very moderate heat. We would recommend common white enamel, or arsenical glass, as the fittest material for the whole instrument; and the ink used, in taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the scale, may be the same that is used for the low-priced printing on Delft ware pottery.\u2014First form the scale on the item. Then, having measured the solid contents of the graduated part as exactly as possible, and determined on the general shape of\n\n(A) It would be worth while to try copper enamelled,\nSpecific Gravity.\n\nof the ball and counterpoise below, calculate its size, so that it may be a little less than ten times that of the item. The glass-blower can copy this very nearly, and join it to the item. Then make two brines or other liquors, which shall have specific gravities in the ratio of 10 to 11. Load the instrument so that it may sink to 10 in the lightest. When put into the heaviest, it should rise to 10. If it does not rise so high, the immersed part is too small. Let the glass-blower enlarge the ball of the counterpoise a little. Repeat this trial till it be exact. Nothing now remains but to form the weights:\n\nAnd here we observe, that when the instrument is to have a very great range, as for examining all states of the vitriolic acid, it has a chance of being very tottering when loaded with the greatest weight on the top of so long a scale. To avoid this, Mr Quin and others have added some of their weights below.\u2014But this will not suit the present construction, because it will alter the proportion between the balks of the item and immersed part. Therefore let these weights consist of cylinders of metal small enough to go into the item, and let them be soldered to the end of long wires, which will let them go to the bottom, and leave a small hook or ring at top. These can lie alongside of the instrument in its case. This is indeed the best construction for every hydrometer, because it makes it incomparably more steady. The instrument is poised by small shot or mercury. But it will be much better to do it with Newton's fusible metal (three parts of tin, five parts of lead, and eight parts of bitumen) in coarse filings. When the exact quantity has been put in, the instrument may be set in a vessel of oil, and this kept on the fire till all is completely melted. It soon freezes again, and remains fast. If this metal is not to be had, let a few bits of sealing wax be added to the mercury or shot, to make up the counterpoise. When heated, it will float a-top, and when it freezes again it will keep all fast. Thus we shall make a very complete and cheap instrument.\n\nThere is yet another method of examining the specific gravities of fluids, first proposed by Dr Wilton, late professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> in the university of Glasgow. This is, by a series of small glass bubbles, differing equally, or according to some rule, from each other in specific gravity, and each marked with its proper number. When these are thrown into a fluid which is to be examined, all those which are heavier than the fluid will fall to the bottom. Then holding the vessel in the hand, or near a fire or candle, the fluid expands, and one of the floating bubbles begins to sink. Its specific gravity, therefore was either equal to, or a little less than, that of the fluid; and the degree of the thermometer, when it began to sink, will inform us how much it was deficient, if we know the law of expansion of the liquor. Sets of these bubbles fitted for the examination of spirituous liquors, with a little treatise showing the manner of using them, and calculating by the thermometer, are made by Mr Brown, an ingenious artist of Glasgow, and are often used by the dealers in spirits, being found both accurate and expeditious.\n\nAlso, though a bubble or two should be broken, the strength of spirits may easily be had by means of the remainder, unless two or three is immediate succession be wanting; for a liquor which answers to No. 4 will sink No. 2. by heating it a few degrees, and therefore No. 3. may be spared. This is a great advantage in ordinary business. A nice hydrometer is not only an expensive instrument, but exceedingly delicate, being so very thin. If broken or even bruised, it is useless, and can hardly be repaired except by the very maker.\n\nAs the only question here is, to determine how many gallons of excise proof spirits is contained in a quantity of liquor, the artist has constructed this series of bubbles in the simplest manner possible, by previously making 40 or 50 mixtures of spirits and water, and then adjusting the bubbles to these mixtures. In some sets the number on each bubble is the number of gallons of proof spirits contained in 100 gallons of the liquor. In other sets the number on each bubble expresses the gallons of water which will make a liquor of this strength, if added to 14 gallons of alcohol. Thus, if a liquor answers to No. 4, then 4 gallons of water added to 14 gallons of alcohol will make a liquor of this strength. The first is the best method; for we should be mistaken in supposing that 18 gallons, which answer to No. 4, contains exactly 14 gallons of alcohol: it contains more than 14, for a reason to be given by and by.\n\nBy examining the specific gravity of bodies, the philosopher has made some very curious discoveries. The most remarkable of these is the change which the density of bodies suffers by mixture. It is a most reasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, that when a cubic foot of one substance is mixed any how with a cubic foot of another, the bulk of the mixture will be two cubic feet; and that 18 gallons of water joined to 18 gallons of oil will fill a vessel of 36 gallons. Accordingly this was never doubted; and even Archimedes, the most scrupulous of mathematicians, proceeded on this supposition in the solution of his famous problem, the discovery of the proportion of silver and gold in a mixture of both. He does not even mention it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTULATE\">postulate</a> that may be granted him, so much did he conceive it to be an axiom. Yet a little reflection seems sufficient to make it doubtful and to require examination. A box filled with musket-balls will receive a considerable quantity of small shot, and after this a considerable quantity of fine sand, and after this a considerable quantity of water. Something like this might happen in the admixture of bodies of porous texture. But such substances as metals, glasses, and fluids, where no discontinuity of parts can be perceived, or was suspected, seem free from every chance of this kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a>. Lord Bacon, however, without being a naturalist or mathematician ex professo, inferred from the mobility of fluids that they consisted of discrete particles, which must have pores interposed, whatever be their figure. And if we ascribe the different densities, or other sensible qualities, to difference in size or figure of those particles, it must frequently happen that the smaller particles will be lodged in the interstices between the larger, and thus contribute to the weight of the sensible mass without increasing its bulk. He therefore suspects that mixtures will be in general less bulky than the sum of their ingredients.\n\nAccordingly, the examination of this question was one of the first employments of the Royal Society of London, and long before its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> had occupied the attention of the gentlemen who afterwards composed it. The register of the Society's early meetings contains many experiments on this subject, with mixtures of gold and silver, of other metals, and of various fluids,\nSpecific fluids, examined by the hydrostatic balance of Mr. Boyle. Dr Hooke made a prodigious number, chiefly on articles of commerce, which were unfortunately lost in the fire of London.\n\nIt was soon found, however, that Lord Bacon's conjecture had been well founded, and that bodies changed their density very sensibly in many cases. In general, it was found that bodies which had a strong chemical affinity increased in density, and that their admixture was accompanied with heat.\n\nBy this discovery it is manifest that Archimedes had not solved the problem of detecting the quantity of silver mixed with the gold in King Hiero's crown, and that the physical solution of it requires experiments made on all the kinds of matter that are mixed together. We do not find that this has been done to this day, although we may affirm that there are few questions of more importance. It is a very curious fact in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, and it would be most desirable to be able to reduce it to some general laws: for instance, to ascertain what is the proportion of two ingredients which produces the greatest change of density. This is important in the science of physics, because it gives us considerable information as to the mode of action of those natural powers or forces by which the particles of tangible matter are united. If this introfusception, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRATION\">concentration</a>, compenetration, or by whatever name it be called, were a mere reception of the particles of one substance into the interstices of those of another, it is evident that the greatest concentration would be observed when a small quantity of the recipient is mixed with, or disseminated through, a great quantity of the other. It is thus that a small quantity of fine sand will be received into the interstices of a quantity of small shot, and will increase the weight of the bagful without increasing its bulk. The case is nowise different when a piece of freestone has grown heavier by imbibing or absorbing a quantity of water. If more than a certain quantity of sand has been added to the small shot, it is no longer concealed. In like manner, various quantities of water may combine with a mass of clay, and increase its size and weight alike. All this is very conceivable, occasioning no difficulty.\n\nBut this is not the case in any of the mixtures we are now considering. In all these, the first additions of either of the two substances produce but an inconceivable change of general density; and it is in general most remarkable, whether it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>, when the two ingredients are nearly of equal bulks. We can illustrate even this difference, by reflecting on the imbibition of water by vegetable solids, such as timber. Some kinds of wood have their weight much more increased than their bulks; other kinds of wood are more enlarged in bulk than in weight. The like happens in grains. This is curious, and shows in the most unquestionable manner that the particles of bodies are not in contact, but are kept together by forces which act at a distance. For this distance between the centres of the particles is most evidently susceptible of variation; and this variation is occasioned by the introduction of another substance, which, by acting on the particles by attraction or repulsion, diminishes or increases their mutual actions, and makes new distances necessary for bringing all things again into equilibrium. We refer the curious reader to the ingenious theory of the abbe Bofcovich for an excellent illustration of this subject (Theor. Phil. Nat. \u00a7 de Solutione Chymica).\n\nThis question is no less important to the man of business. Till we know the condensation of those metals by mixture, we cannot tell the quantity of alloy in gold and silver by means of their specific gravity; nor can we tell the quantity of pure alcohol in any spirituous liquor, or that of the valuable salt in any solution of it. For want of this knowledge, the dealers in gold and silver are obliged to have recourse to the tedious and difficult test of the assay, which cannot be made in all places or by all men. It is therefore much to be wished, that some persons would institute a series of experiments in the most interesting cases: for it must be observed, that this change of density is not always a small matter; it is sometimes very considerable and paradoxical. A remarkable instance may be given of it in the mixture of brass and tin for bells, great guns, optical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a>, &c. The specific gravity of each brass is nearly 8.066, and that of tin is nearly 7.363. If two parts of brass be mixed with one part of tin, the specific gravity is 8.017; whereas, if each had retained its former bulk, the sp. grav. would have been only $7.793 = \\frac{2 \\times 8.066 + 7.363}{3}$. A mixture of equal parts should have the specific gravity 7.684; but it is 8.441. A mixture of two parts tin with one part brass, instead of being 7.577, is 8.027.\n\nIn all these cases there is a great increase of specific gravity, and consequently a great condensation of parts or contraction of bulk. The first mixture of eight cubic inches of brass, for instance, with four cubic inches of tin, does not produce 12 cubic inches of bell-metal, but only 10.47 nearly, having shrunk $\\frac{1}{3}$. It would appear that the distances of the brass particles are most affected, or perhaps it is the brass that receives the tin into its pores; for we find that the condensations in these mixtures are nearly proportional to the quantities of the brass in the mixtures. It is remarkable that this mixture with the lightest of all metals has made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> more heavy and dense than brass can be made by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMMERING\">hammering</a>.\n\nThe most remarkable instance occurs in mixing iron with platinum. If 10 cubic inches of iron are mixed with $\\frac{1}{4}$ of platinum, the bulk of the compound is only 9$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The iron therefore has not simply received the platinum into its pores: its own particles are brought nearer together. There are similar results in the solution of turbid mineral, and of some other salts, in water. The water, instead of rising in the neck of the vessel, when a small quantity of the salt has been added to it, sinks considerably, and the two ingredients occupy less room than the water did alone.\n\nThe same thing happens in the mixture of water with other fluids and different fluids with each other: But we are not able to trace any general rule that is observed with absolute precision. In most cases of fluids the greatest condensation happens when the bulks of the ingredients are nearly equal. Thus, in the mixture of alcohol and water, we have the greatest condensation when 16$\\frac{1}{2}$ ounces of alcohol are mixed with 20 ounces of water, and the condensation is about $\\frac{3}{10}$ of the whole bulk of the ingredients. It is extremely various in different substances, and no classification of them can be made in this respect.\n\nA dissertation has been published on this subject by Dr.\nDr Hahn of Vienna, intitled *De Efficacia Mixtionis in mutandis Corporum Voluminibus*, in which all the remarkable influences of the variation of density have been collected. All that we can do (as we have no directing principle) is to record such influences as are of chief importance, being articles of commerce.\n\nThe first that occurs to us is the mixtures of alcohol and water in the composition of spirituous liquors. This has been considered by many with great care. The most scrupulous examination of this, or perhaps of any mixture, has been lately made by Dr Blagden (now Sir Charles Blagden) of the Royal Society, on the requisition of the Board of Excise. He has published an account of the examination in the Philosophical Transactions of London in 1791 and 1792. We shall give an account of it under the article *SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS*; and at present only select one column, in order to show the condensation. The alcohol was almost the strongest that can be produced, and its specific gravity, when of the temperature 65\u00b0, was 0.825. The whole mixtures were of the same temperature.\n\nColumn 1. contains the pounds, ounces, or other measures by weight, of alcohol in the mixture. Column 2. contains the pounds or ounces of water. Column 3. is the sum of the bulks of the ingredients, the bulk of a pound or ounce of water being accounted 1. Column 4. is the observed specific gravity of the mixture, taken from Dr Blagden's dissertation. Column 5. is the specific gravity which would have been observed if the ingredients had each retained its own specific gravity. This was calculated by dividing the sum of the two numbers of the first and second columns by the corresponding number of the third. Column 6. is the difference of column 4. and column 5. and exhibits the condensation.\n\n| A. | W. | Volume | Sp. Grav. observed | Sp.

Since the specific gravity of alcohol is 0.825, it is evident that 16\u00bd ounces of alcohol and 20 ounces of water have equal bulks. So that the condensation is greatest when the substances are mixed in equal volumes; and 18 gallons of alcohol mixed with 18 gallons of water will produce not 36 gallons of spirits, but 35 only.\n\nWe may also observe, that this is the mixture to which our revenue laws refer, declaring it to be one to six or one in seven under proof, and to weigh 7 pounds 13 ounce per gallon. This proportion was probably selected as the most easily composed, viz. by mixing equal measures of water and of the strongest spirit which the known processes of distillation could produce. Its specific gravity is 0.939 very nearly.\n\nWe must consider this elaborate examination of the mixture of water and alcohol as a standard series of experiments, to which appeal may always be made, whether for the purposes of science or of trade. The regularity of the progression is so great, that in the column which we have examined, viz. that for temperature 65\u00b0, the greatest anomaly does not amount to one part in five thousand. The form of the series is also very judiciously chosen for the purposes of science. It would perhaps have been more directly stereometrical had the proportions of the ingredients been stated in bulks, which are more immediately connected with density. But the author has assigned a very cogent reason for his choice, viz. that the proportion of bulks varies by a change of temperature, because the water and spirits follow different laws in their expansion by heat.\n\nThis is a proper opportunity for taking notice of a mistake which is very generally made in the conclusions drawn from experiments of this kind. Equal additions of the spirit or water produce a series of specific gravities, which decrease or increase by differences continually diminishing. Hence it is inferred that there is a contraction of bulk. Even Dr Lewis, one of our most accomplished...\nSpecific Gravity.\n\ncomplished naturalists advances this position, in a differentiation on the potash of America; and it considerably affects his method for estimating the strength of the potash leys. But that it is a mistake, appears plainly from this, that although we add for ever equal quantities of the spirits, we shall never produce a mixture which has as small a specific gravity as alcohol. Therefore the series of successive gravities must approximate to this without end, like the ordinates of a hyperbolic curve referred to its asymptote.\n\nThat this may appear in the most general terms, let \\( w \\) represent the weight of the constant quantity of water in the mixture, and let \\( a \\) be the weight of the small addition of spirits. Also let \\( w \\) represent the bulk of this quantity of water, and \\( b \\) the bulk of the small addition of alcohol. The weight of the mixture is \\( w + a \\), and its bulk is \\( w + b \\), and its specific gravity is \\( \\frac{w + a}{w + b} \\).\n\nIf we now add a second equal quantity of spirits, the weight will be \\( w + 2a \\), and if the spirit retains its density unchanged, the bulk will be \\( w + 2b \\), and the specific gravity is \\( \\frac{w + 2a}{w + 2b} \\); and after any number \\( m \\) of such equal additions of spirits, the specific gravity will be \\( \\frac{w + ma}{w + mb} \\). Divide the numerator of this fraction by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a>, and the quotient or specific gravity will be \\( 1 + \\frac{m(a - b)}{w + mb} \\). This consists of the constant part 1, and the variable part \\( \\frac{m(a - b)}{w + mb} \\). We need attend only to this part. If its denominator were constant, it is plain that the successive specific gravities would have equal differences, each being \\( \\frac{a - b}{w + mb} \\), because \\( m \\) increases by the continual addition of an unit, and \\( a - b \\) is a constant quantity. But the denominator \\( w + mb \\) continually increases, and therefore the value of the fraction \\( \\frac{a - b}{w + mb} \\) continually diminishes.\n\nTherefore the gradual diminution of the increments or decrements of specific gravity, by equal additions of one ingredient to a constant measure of the other, is not of itself an indication of a change of density of either of the ingredients; nor proves that in very diluted mixtures a greater proportion of one ingredient is absorbed or lodged in the interstices of the other, as is generally imagined. This must be ascertained by comparing each specific gravity with the gravity expressed by \\( 1 + \\frac{w + m(a - b)}{w + mb} \\).\n\nThis series of specific gravities resembles such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> series as the following, 1; . . . . . . ; 1.56; 1.163; 1.469; &c., the terms of which also consist of the constant integer 1, and the decimal fractions 0.156; 0.163; 0.169; &c. The fraction \\( \\frac{m(a - b)}{w + mb} \\) expresses this decimal part. Call this \\( d \\), or make \\( d = \\frac{m(a - b)}{w + mb} \\).\n\nThis will give us \\( b = \\frac{ma - w}{m(1 + d)} \\). Now \\( a \\) is the weight of the added ingredient, and \\( d \\) is the variable part of the specific gravity observed; and thus we learn whether \\( b \\), the bulk of the added ingredient, suffers any change. We shall have occasion by and by to resume the consideration of this question, which is of the first moment in the theory of specific gravities, and has great influence in many transactions of commerce.\n\nThis series of specific gravities is not so well fitted for commercial transactions. In these the usual question is, how many gallons of alcohol is there in a cask, or some number of gallons of spirit? and it is more directly answered by means of a table, formed by mixing the ingredients in aliquant parts of one constant bulk. The following table, constructed from the experiments of Mr Brillon of the academy of Paris, and published in the Memoirs for 1769, is therefore inserted.\n\n| W. | A. | Density observed. | Density computed. | Condensation. | Bulk of 10,000 grains. |\n|----|----|------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| 0  | 16 | 0.8371           | 0.8371            |              | 1.0000               |\n| 1  | 15 | 0.8327           | 0.8473            | 63           | 0.9937               |\n| 2  | 14 | 0.8674           | 0.8575            | 115          | 0.9885               |\n| 3  | 13 | 0.8815           | 0.8677            | 157          | 0.9844               |\n| 4  | 12 | 0.8947           | 0.8778            | 189          | 0.9811               |\n| 5  | 11 | 0.9075           | 0.8880            | 214          | 0.9786               |\n| 6  | 10 | 0.9199           | 0.8982            | 235          | 0.9765               |\n| 7  | 9  | 0.9317           | 0.9084            | 251          | 0.9749               |\n| 8  | 8  | 0.9427           | 0.9186            | 266          | 0.9744               |\n| 9  | 7  | 0.9519           | 0.9287            | 243          | 0.9757               |\n| 10 | 6  | 0.9598           | 0.9389            | 217          | 0.9783               |\n| 11 | 5  | 0.9674           | 0.9491            | 189          | 0.9811               |\n| 12 | 4  | 0.9733           | 0.9593            | 144          | 0.9856               |\n| 13 | 3  | 0.9791           | 0.9695            | 99           | 0.9901               |\n| 14 | 2  | 0.9852           | 0.9796            | 57           | 0.9943               |\n| 15 | 1  | 0.9919           | 0.9898            | 21           | 0.9979               |\n| 16 | 0  | 1.0000           | 1.0000            |              | 1.0000               |\n\nIn this table the whole quantity of spirituous liquor is always the same. The first column is the number of measures (gallons, pints, inches, &c.), of water in the mixture: and column 2d gives the measures of alcohol. Column 3d is the specific gravity which was observed by Mr Brillon. Column 4th is the specific gravity which would have been observed if the spirits, or water, or both, had retained their specific density unchanged. And the 5th column marks the augmentation of specific gravity or density in parts of 10,000. A 6th column is added, showing the bulk of the 16 cubic measures of the two ingredients. Each measure may be conceived as the 16th part of 10,000, or 625; and we may suppose them cubic inches, pints, gallons, or any solid measure.\n\nThis table scarcely differs from Sir Charles Blagden's; and the very small difference that may be observed, arises from Mr Brillon's having used an alcohol not so completely rectified. Its specific gravity is 9.8371, whereas the other was only 9.8250.\n\nHere it appears more distinctly that the condensation is greatest when the two ingredients are of equal bulk.\n\nPerhaps this series of specific gravities is as declarative as the other, whether or not there is a change of density induced in either of the ingredients. The whole.\nwhole bulk being always the same, it is plain that the successive equal additions to one of the ingredients is a successive equal abstraction of the other. The change produced, therefore, in the weight of the whole, is the difference between the weight of the ingredient which is taken out and the weight of the equal measure of the other which supplies its place. Therefore, if neither ingredient changes its density by mixture, the weights of the mixtures will be in arithmetical progression. If they are not, there is a variation of density in one or both the ingredients.\n\nWe see this very clearly in the mixtures of water and alcohol. The spirit specific gravity differs from the second by 156, and the last differs from the preceding by no more than 81. Had neither of the densities changed, the common difference would have been 102. We observe also, that the augmentation of specific gravity, by the successive addition of a measure of water, grows less and less till 12 measures of water is mixed with 4 of alcohol, when the augmentation is only 58, and then it increases again to 81.\n\nIt also appears, that the addition of one measure of water to a quantity of alcohol produces a greater change of density than the mixture of one measure of alcohol to a quantity of water. Hence some conclude, that the water disappears by being lodged in the interstices of the spirit. But it is more agreeable to the justest notions which we can form of the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of tangible bodies to suppose that the particles of water diminish the distances between the particles of alcohol by their strong attractions, and that this diminution (exceedingly minute in itself) becomes sensible on account of the great number of particles whose distances are thus diminished. This is merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> founded on this, that it would require a much greater diminution of distances if it was the particles of water which had their distances thus diminished. But the greater probability is, that the condensation takes place in both.\n\nWe have been so particular in our consideration of this mixture, because the law of variation of density has, in this instance, been ascertained with such precision by the elaborate examination of Sir Charles Blagden, so that it may serve as an example of what happens in almost every mixture of bodies. It merits a still farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, because it is intimately connected with the action of the corporeal forces; and an exact knowledge of the variations of distance between the particles will go far to ascertain the law of action of these forces. But the limits of a work like this will not permit us to dwell longer on this subject. We proceed therefore to give another useful table.\n\nThe vitriolic or sulphuric acid is of extensive use in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> under the name of oil of vitriol. Its value depends entirely on the saline ingredient, and the water is merely a vehicle for the acid. This, being much denser than water, affects its specific gravity, and thus gives us a method of ascertaining its strength.\n\nThe strongest oil of vitriol that can be easily manufactured contains 612\u00bd grains of dry acid, united with 387\u00bd grains of water, which cannot be separated from it by distillation, making 1000 grains of oil of vitriol. Its specific gravity in this state is 1.877.\n\nThe following table shows its specific gravity at the temperature of 55\u00b0 when diluted by the successive addition of parts of water by weight.\n\n| O' Vit. | Water | Observed | Calculated | Cond. |\n|---------|-------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 10      | X     | 1.877    | 1.877      | .00   |\n| 4       |       | 1.644    | 1.501      | .143  |\n| 8       |       | 1.474    | 1.350      | .124  |\n| 12      |       | 1.381    | 1.269      | .112  |\n| 16      |       | 1.320    | 1.219      | .101  |\n| 20      |       | 1.274    | 1.184      | .090  |\n| 24      |       | 1.243    | 1.159      | .084  |\n| 28      |       | 1.211    | 1.140      | .071  |\n| 32      |       | 1.195    | 1.125      | .070  |\n| 36      |       | 1.183    | 1.113      | .070  |\n| 40      |       | 1.172    | 1.103      | .070  |\n| 50      |       | 1.148    | 1.084      | .064  |\n| 60      |       | 1.128    | 1.069      | .059  |\n\nHere is observed a much greater condensation than in the mixture of alcohol and water. But we cannot assign the proportion of ingredients which produces the greatest condensation; because we cannot, in any case, lay what is the proportion of the saline and watery ingredients. The strongest oil of vitriol is already a watery solution; and it is by a considerable and uncertain detour that Mr Kirwan has assigned the proportion of 612 and 388 nearly. If this be the true ratio, it is unlike every other solution that we are acquainted with; for in all solutions of salts, the salt occupies less room in its liquid form than it did when solid; and here it would be greatly the reverse.\n\nThis solution is remarkable also for the copious emergence of heat in its dilutions with more water. This has been ascribed to the great superiority of water in its capacity for heat; but there are facts which render this very doubtful. A vessel of water, and another of oil of vitriol, being brought from a cold room into a warm one, they both imbibe heat, and rise in their temperature; and the water employs nearly the same time to attain the temperature of the room.\n\nAquafortis or nitrous acid is another fluid very much employed in commerce; so that it is of importance to ascertain the relation between its saline strength and its specific gravity. We owe also to Mr Kirwan a table for this purpose.\n\nThe most concentrated state into which it can easily be brought is such, that 1000 grains of it consists of 653 grains of water and 347 of dry acid. In this state its specific gravity is 1.557. Let this be called nitrous acid.\n\n| Nitr. Ac. | Water | Observed | Calculated | Cond. |\n|-----------|-------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 10        | X     | 1.557    | 1.557      | .00   |\n| 1         |       | 1.474    | 1.474      | .077  |\n| 6         |       | 1.350    | 1.273      | .077  |\n| 11        |       | 1.269    | 1.191      | .078  |\n| 16        |       | 1.214    | 1.147      | .067  |\n| 21        |       | 1.175    | 1.120      | .055  |\n| 26        |       | 1.151    | 1.101      | .050  |\n| 31        |       | 1.127    | 1.087      | .040  |\n| 36        |       | 1.106    | 1.077      | .029  |\n| 41        |       | 1.086    | 1.068      | .018  |\n\nThere is not the same uniformity in the densities of this acid in its different states of dilution. This seems owing.\nowing to the variable proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DELETERIOUS\">deleterious</a> and vital air which compose this acid. It is more dense in proportion as it contains more of the latter ingredient.\n\nThe proportions of the aeriform ingredients of the muriatic acid are so very variable, and so little under our command, that we cannot frame tables of its specific gravity which would enable us to judge of its strength.\n\nIt is a general property of these acids, that they are more expandible by heat as they are more concentrated.\n\nThere is another class of fluids which it would be of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to reduce to some rules with respect to specific gravity, namely, the solutions of salts, gums, and resins. It is interesting to the philosopher to know in what manner salts are contained in these watery solutions, and to discover the relation between their strength and density; and to the man of business it would be a most desirable thing to have a criterion of the quantity of salt in any brine, or of extractable matter in a decoction. It would be equally desirable to those who are to purchase them as to those who manufacture or employ them. Perhaps we might ascertain in this way the value of sugar, depending on the quantity of sweetening matter which it contains; a thing which at present rests on the vague determination of the eye or palate. It would therefore be doing a great service to the public, if some intelligent person would undertake a train of experiments with this view. Accuracy alone is required; and it may be left to the philosophers to compare the facts, and draw the consequences respecting the internal arrangement of the particles.\n\nOne circumstance in the solution of salts is very general; and we are inclined, for serious reasons, to think it universal: this is a diminution of bulk. This indeed in some salts is inconsiderable. Sedative salt, for instance, hardly shows any diminution, and might be considered as an exception, were it not the single instance. This circumstance, and some considerations connected with our notions of this kind of solution, dispose us to think that this salt differs in contraction from others only in degree, and that there is some, though it was not sensible, in the experiments hitherto made.\n\nThese experiments, indeed, have not been numerous. Those of Mr Achard of Berlin, and of Dr Richard Watson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, are perhaps the only ones of which we have a descriptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a>, by which we can judge of the validity of the inferences drawn from them. The subject is not susceptible of much accuracy; for salts in their solid form are seldom free from cavities and thorny interstices, which do not admit the water on their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a>, and thereby appear of greater bulk when we attempt to measure their specific gravity by weighing them in fluids which do not dissolve them, such as spirits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>. They also attach to themselves, with considerable tenacity, a quantity of atmospheric air, which merely adheres, but makes no part of their composition. This escapes in the act of solution, being set at liberty by the stronger affinity of the water. Sal gem, however, and a few others, may be very accurately measured; and in these instances the degree of contraction is very constant.\n\nThe following experiments of Dr Watson appear to us the most instructive as to this circumstance. A glass vessel was used, having a slender cylindrical neck, and holding 67 ounces of pure water when filled to a certain mark. The neck above this mark had a scale of equal parts pasted on it. It was filled to the mark with water. Twenty-four pennyweights of salt were thrown into it as speedily as possible, and the bulk of the salt was measured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the water. Everything was attended to which could retard the immediate solution, that the error arising from the solution of the first particles, before the rest could be put in, might be as small as possible; and in order that both the absolute bulk and its variations might be obtained by some known scale, 24 pennyweights of water were put in. This raised the surface 58 parts of the scale. Now we know exactly the bulk of 24 pennyweights of pure water. It is 2.275 cubic inches; and thus we obtain everything in absolute measures: And by comparing the bulk of each salt, both at its first immersion and after its complete solution, we obtain its specific gravity, and the change made on it in passing from a solid to a fluid form. The following table is an abstract of these experiments. The first column of numbers is the elevation of the surface immediately after immersion; the second gives the elevation when the salt is completely dissolved; and the third and fourth columns are the specific gravities of the salts in these two states.\n\n| Twenty-four Pennyweights | I. | II. | III. | IV. |\n|--------------------------|----|-----|------|-----|\n| Water                    | 58 |     |      |     |\n| Glauber's salt           | 42 | 36  | 1.380| 1.611|\n| Mild volatile alkali     | 40 | 33  | 1.450| 1.787|\n| Sal ammoniac             | 40 | 39  | 1.450| 1.877|\n| Refined white sugar      | 39 | 36  | 1.487| 1.611|\n| Coarse brown sugar       | 39 | 36  | 1.487| 1.611|\n| White sugar candy        | 37 | 36  | 1.567| 1.611|\n| Lymington Glauber's salt | 35 | 29  | 1.657| 2.000|\n| Terra foliata tartar     | 37 | 30  | 1.567| 1.933|\n| Rochelle salt            | 33 | 28  | 1.757| 2.071|\n| Alum not quite dissolved | 33 | 28  | 1.757| 2.061|\n| Borax not one-half dissolved in two days | 33 | 31  | 1.757|     |\n| Green vitriol            | 32 | 26  | 1.812| 2.230|\n| White vitriol            | 30 | 24  | 1.933| 2.416|\n| Nitre                    | 30 | 21  | 1.933| 2.706|\n| Sal gem from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NORTHWICH\">Northwich</a>   | 27 | 17  | 2.143| 3.411|\n| Blue vitriol             | 26 | 20  | 2.230| 2.900|\n| Pearl ashes              | 25 | 10  | 2.320| 5.800|\n| Tart. vitriolatus        | 22 | 11  | 2.636| 5.272|\n| Green vitriol calcined to white | 22 | 11  | 2.636| 5.272|\n| Dry salt of tartar       | 21 | 13  | 2.761| 4.401|\n| Basket sea-salt           | 19 | 15  | 3.052| 3.866|\n| Corroitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>     | 14 | 10  | 4.142| 3.800|\n| Turbit mineral           | 9  | 0   | 6.444|     |\n\nThe inspection of this list naturally suggests two states of the case as particularly interesting to the philosopher studying the theory of solution. The first state is when the lixivium approaches to saturation. In the very point of saturation any addition of salt retains its bulk unchanged. In diluted brines, we shall see that the den-\nSpecific gravity of the fluid salt is greater, and gradually diminishes as we add more salt. It is an important question, whether this diminution goes on continually, till the fluid density of the salt is the same with its solid density? or, whether there is an abrupt fallage from some degree of the one to the fixed degree of the other, as we observe in the freezing of iron, the setting of flucoo, and some other instances?\n\nThe other interesting state is that of extreme dilution, when the differences between the succedane densities bear a great proportion to the densities themselves, and thus enable the mathematician to ascertain with some precision the variations of corpuscular force, in consequence of a variation of distance between the particles. The sketch of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of this important question given by Bolcovitch, in his Theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a>, is very promising, and should incite the philosophical chemist to the study. The first thing to be done is to compare the law of specific gravity; that is, the relation between the specific gravity and quantity of salt held in solution.\n\nWith the view to make this work as useful as possible, we have searched for experiments, and trains of experiments, on the density of the many brines which make important articles of commerce; but we were mortified by the scantiness of the information, and disappointed in our hopes of being able to combine the detached observations, suited to the immediate views of their authors, in such a manner as to deduce from them scales (as they may be called) of their strength. We rarely found these detached observations attended with circumstances which would connect them with others; and there was frequently such a discrepancy, nay opposition, in series of experiments made for ascertaining the relation between the density and the strength, that we could not obtain general principles which enable us to construct tables of strength a priori.\n\nMr Lambert, one of the first mathematicians and philosophers of Europe, in a dissertation in the Berlin Memoirs (1762), gives a narration of experiments on the brines of common salt, from which he deduces a very great condensation, which he attributes to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> in the weak brines of the salt, or a lodgement of its particles in the interstices of the particles of water. Mr Achard of the same academy, in 1785, gives a very great list of experiments on the bulks of various brines, made in a different way, which show no such introduction; and Dr Watson thinks this confirmed by experiments which he narrates in his Chemical Essays. We see great reason for hesitating our assent to either side, and do not think the experiments decisive. We incline to Mr Lambert's opinion; for this reason, that in the succedane dilutions of oil of vitriol and aquafortis there is a most evident and remarkable condensation. Now what are these but brines, of which we have not been able to get the saline ingredient in a separate form? The experiments of Mr Achard and Dr Watson were made in such a way that a single grain in the measurement bore too great a proportion to the whole change of specific gravity. At the same time, some of Dr Watson's are so simple in their nature that it is very difficult to withhold the assent.\n\nIn this state of uncertainty, in a subject which seems to us to be of public importance, we thought it our duty to undertake a train of experiments to which recourse may always be had. Works like this are seldom considered as sources of original information; and it is thought sufficient when the knowledge already diffused is judiciously compiled. But a due respect for the public, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> reception hitherto given to our labours, induce us to exert ourselves with honest zeal to merit the continuance of public favour. We allure our readers that the experiments were made with care, and on quantities sufficiently large to make the unavoidable irregularities in such cases quite insignificant. The law of density was ascertained in each instance in two ways. We dissolved different portions of salt in the same quantity of water, and examined the specific gravity of the brine by weighing it in a vessel with a narrow neck. The portions of salt were each of them one-eighth of what would make a nearly saturated solution of the temperature 55\u00b0. We did not make the brine stronger, that there might be no risk of a precipitation in form of crystals. We considered the specific gravities as the ordinates of a curve, of which the abscissae were the numbers of ounces of dry salt contained in a cubic foot of the brine. Having thus obtained eight ordinates corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 portions of salt, the ordinates or specific gravities for every other proportion of salt were had by the usual methods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPOLATION\">interpolation</a>.\n\nThe other method was, by first making a brine nearly saturated, in which the proportion of salt and water was exactly determined. We then took out one-eighth of the brine, and filled up the vessel with water, taking care that the mixture should be complete; for which purpose, besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, the diluted brine was allowed to remain 24 hours before weighing. Taking out one-eighth of the brine also takes out one eighth of the salt; so that the proportion of salt and water in the diluted brine was known. It was now weighed, and thus we determined the specific gravity for a new proportion of salt and water.\n\nWe then took out one-seventh of the brine. It is evident that this takes out one-eighth of the original quantity of salt; an abstraction equal to the former. We filled the vessel with water with the same precautions; and in the same manner we proceeded till there remained only one-eighth of the original quantity of salt.\n\nThe specific gravities by these two methods agreed extremely well. In the very deliquescent salts the first method exhibited some small irregularities, arising from the unequal quantities of water which they had imbibed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. We therefore confined most in the experiments made with diluted brines.\n\nThat the reader may judge of the authority of the tables which we shall insert, we submit to his inspection one series of experiments.\n\nTwo thousand one hundred and eighty-eight grains of very pure and dry (but not decrepitated) common salt, prepared in large crystals, were dissolved in 6562 grains of distilled water of the temperature 55\u00b0. A small matra's with a narrow neck, which held 4200 grains of distilled water, was filled with this brine. Its contents weighed 5027 grams. Now \\( \\frac{6562}{2188} = \\frac{5027}{1256.75} \\). Therefore the bottle of brine contained 1256.75 grams of salt dissolved in 3770.25 grams of water. Its specific gravity is \\( \\frac{5027}{4200} \\), or 1.196905; and a cubic foot of brine weighs 1196.9.\nSpecific Gravity.\n\n1196.9 ounces avoirdupois. Also $\\frac{5027}{1256.75} = \\frac{1196.9}{299.28}$. Therefore a cubic foot of this brine contains 299.28 ounces of perfectly dry salt.\n\nThe subsequent steps of the process are represented as follows:\n\n| Salt | Brine | Water | Wt. of Cub.

Its specific gravity is $\\frac{4313}{4200} = 1.0279$, and a cubic foot of it weighs 1028 ounces, and contains 37.4 ounces of dry salt. In like manner may the specific gravity, the weight of a cubic foot, and the salt it contains, be estimated for the intermediate brines.\n\nWhen these eight quantities of salt contained in a cubic foot are made the abscissas, and the weights of the cubic foot of brine are the corresponding ordinates, the curve will be found to be extremely regular, resembling a hyperbolic arch whose asymptote makes an angle of 32\u00b0 with the axis. Ordinates were then interpolated analytically for every 10 ounces of contained salt, and thus the table was constructed. We did not, however, rely on one series alone; but made others, in which one-fourth of the salt was repeatedly abstracted. They agreed, in the case of common salt, with great exactness, and in some others there were some very inconsiderable irregularities.\n\nTo show the authority of the tables of strength was by no means our only motive for giving an example of the process. It may be of use as a pattern for similar experiments. But, besides, it is very instructive. We see, in the first place, that there is a very sensible change of density in one or both of the ingredients. For the series is of that nature (as we have formerly explained), that if the ingredients retained their densities in every proportion of commixture, the specific gravities would have been in arithmetical progression; whereas we see that their differences continually diminish as the brines grow more dense. We can form some notion of this by comparing the different brines. Thus in the first brine, weighing 5027 grains, there are 3770 grains of water in a vessel holding 4200. If the density of the water remains the same, there is left for the salt only as much space as would hold 430 grains of water. In this space are lodged 1257 grains of salt, and its specific gravity, in its liquid form, is $\\frac{1257}{430} = 2.8907$ very nearly. But in the 8th brine the quantity of water is 4156, the space left for 157 grains of salt is only the bulk of 44 grains of water, and the density of the salt is $\\frac{157}{44} = 3.568$, considerably greater than before. This induced us to continue the dilution of the brine as follows, beginning with the 8th brine.\n\nThis last brine contains 4198.2 grains of water, leaving only the bulk of 1.8 grains of water to contain 19.8 of salt, so that the salt is ten times denser than water. This will make the strength 243 instead of 210 indicated by the specific gravity. But we do not pretend to measure the densities with accuracy in these diluted brines. It is evident from the process that a single\nSingle grain of excess or defect in taking out the brine and replacing it with water has a sensible proportion to the whole variation. But we see with sufficient evidence, that from the strong to the weak brine the space left for the portion of salt is continually diminishing. In the first dilution 527\u00bd grains of water were added to fill up the vessel; but one-eighth of its contents of pure water is only 525\u00bd so that here is a diminution of two grains and a half in the space occupied by the remaining salt. The subsequent additions are 604\u00bd; 706\u00bd; 847\u00bd; 1054\u00bd; 1405\u00bd; 2102\u00bd; 2105\u00bd; 2102\u00bd; 2102\u00bd instead of 600; 700; 840; 1050; 1400; 2100; 2100; 2100; 2100. Nothing can more plainly show the condensation in general, though we do not learn whether it happens in one or both of the ingredients; nor do the experiments show with sufficient accuracy the progression of this diminution. The excesses of the added water being only five or seven grains, we cannot expect a nice repartition. When the brine is taken out, the upper part of the vessel remains lined with a briny film containing a portion of salt and water, perhaps equal or superior to the differences. Had our time permitted, we should have examined this matter with scrupulous attention, using a vessel with a still narrower neck, and in each dilution abstracting one half of the brine. The curve, whose abscissae and ordinates represent the weight of the contained salt and the weight of a constant bulk of the brine, exhibits the best and most synoptical view of the law of condensation, because the position of the tangent in any point, or the value of the symbol $\\frac{d}{y}$, always shows the rate at which the specific gravity increases or diminishes. We are inclined to think that the curve in all cases is of the hyperbolic kind, and complete; that is, having the tangent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the axis at the beginning of the curve. The mathematical reader will easily guess the physical notions which incline us to this opinion; and will also see that it is hardly possible to discover this experimentally, because the mistake of a single grain in the very small ordinates will change the position of the tangent many degrees. It was for this reason that we thought it useless to prosecute the dilution any farther. But we think that it may be prosecuted much farther in Dr Watson's or Mr Achard's method, viz. by dissolving equal weights of salt in two vessels, of very different capacities, having tubular necks, in which the change of bulk may be very accurately observed. We can only conclude, that the condensation is greatest in the strongest brines, and probably attains its maximum when the quantities of true saline matter and water are nearly equal, as in the case of vitriolic acid, &c.\n\nWe consider these experiments as abundantly sufficient for deciding the question \"Whether the salt can be received into the pores of the water, or the water into the pores of the salt, so as to increase its weight without increasing its bulk?\" and we must grant that it may. We do not mean that it is simply lodged in the pores as sand is lodged in the interstices of small flot; but the two together occupy less room than when separate. The experiments of Mr Achard were insufficient for a decision, because made on too small a quantity as 600 grains of water. Dr Watson's experiments have, for the most part, the same defect. Some of them, however, are of great value in this question, and are very fit for altering the specific gravity of dissolved salts. In one of them (not particularly narrated) he found that a quantity of dissolved salt occupied the same bulk in two very different states of dilution. We cannot pretend to reconcile this with our experiments. We have given these as they stood; and we think them conclusive, because they were so numerous and so perfectly consistent with each other; and their result is so general, that we have not found an exception. Common salt is by no means the most remarkable instance of condensation. Vegetable alkali, sal ammoniac, and some others, exhibit much condensation.\n\nWe thought this a proper opportunity of considering this question, which is intimately connected with the principles of chemical solution, and was not perhaps considered in sufficient detail under the article Chemistry. We learn from it in general, that the quantities of salt in brines increase at somewhat a greater rate than their specific gravities. This difference is in many cases of sensible importance in a commercial view. Thus an alkaline lixivium for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a> or soap-making, whose specific gravity is 1.234, or exceeds that of water by 234, contains 361 ounces of salt in a cubic foot; a ley, which exceeds the weight of water twice as much, or 468 ounces per cubic foot, contains 777 ounces of salt, which exceeds the double of 361 by 55 ounces more than seven per cent. Hence we learn, that hydrometers for discovering the strength of brines, having equal divisions on a cylindrical stem, are very erroneous; for even if the increments of specific gravity were proportional to the quantities of salt in a gallon of brine, the divisions at the bottom of the stem ought to be smaller than those above.\n\nThe construction of the following table of strengths, from the above narrated series of brines is sufficiently obvious. Column 1st is the specific gravity as discovered by the balance or hydrometer, and also is the number of ounces in a cubic foot of the brine. Col. 2d is the ounces of the dry salt contained in it.\n\n| Weight in Cub. Ft. Brine | Salt in Cub. Ft. | Weight in Cub. Ft. Brine | Salt in Cub.

The quantities of salt corresponding to any specific gravity are about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) less than in his table. But the reader will see that they correspond with the series of experiments above narrated; and there were but a few of many which all corresponded within an hundredth part. The cause of the difference seems to be, that most kinds of common salt contain magnesian salts, which contain a very great proportion of water necessary for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>. The salt which we used was of the purest kind, but such as may be had from every salt work, by Lord Dundonald's very easy process, viz. by passing through it a saturated solution boiling hot, which carries off with it about four fifths of all the bitter salts. Our aim being to ascertain the quantities of pure sea-salt, and to learn by the bye its relation to water in respect of density, we thought it necessary to use the purest salt. We also dried it for several days in a stove, so that it contained no water not absolutely necessary for its crystallization. An ounce of such salt will communicate a greater specific gravity to water than an ounce of a salt that is less pure, or that contains extraneous water.\n\nThe specific gravity 1.090 is that of ordinary pickles, which are estimated as to strength by floating an egg.\n\nWe cannot raise the specific gravity higher than 1.266 by simply dissolving salt in cold water. But it will become much denser, and will even attain the specific gravity 1.245 by boiling, then holding about 366 ounces in the cubic foot of hot brine. But it will deposit by cooling, and when the temperature 55\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 hardly exceeds 1.266. We obtained a brine by boiling till the salt gained very rapidly. When it cooled to 60\u00b0, its specific gravity was 1.2663; for a vessel which held 3506 grains of distilled water held 4229 of this brine. This was evaporated to dryness, and there were obtained 1344 grains of salt. By this was computed the number interposed between 310 and 320 in the table. We have, however, raised the specific gravity to 1.277, by putting in no more salt than was necessary for this density, and using heat. It then cooled down to 60\u00b0 without quitting any salt; but if a few grains of salt be thrown into this brine, it will quickly deposit a great deal more, and its density will decrease to 1.266. We find this to hold in all salts; and it is a very instructive fact in the theory of crystallization; it resembles the effect which a magnet produces upon iron filings in its neighbourhood. It makes them temporary magnets, and causes them to arrange themselves as if they had been really made permanent magnets. Just so a crystal already formed deposits the rest to crystallize. We imagine that this analogy is complete, and that the forces are similar in both cases.\n\nThe above table is computed for the temperature 55\u00b0; but in other temperatures the strength will be different on two accounts, viz. the expansion of the brine and the dissolving power of the water. Water expands about 40 parts in 1000 when heated from 60\u00b0 to 212\u00b0. Saturated brine expands about 48 parts, or one-fifth more than water; and this excess of expansion is nearly proportional to the quantity of salt in the brine. If therefore any circumstance should oblige us to examine a brine in a temperature much above 60\u00b0, allowance should be made for this. Thus, should the specific gravity of brine of the temperature 130 (which is nearly half way between 60 and 212) be 1.140, we must increase it by 20 (half of 40); and having found the strength 240 corresponding to this corrected specific gravity, we must correct it again by adding 1 to the specific gravity for every 45 ounces of salt.\n\nBut a much greater and more uncertain correction is necessary on account of the variation of the dissolving power of water by heat. This indeed is very small in the case of sea-salt in comparison with other salts. We presume that our readers are apprised of this peculiarity of sea-salt, that it dissolves nearly in equal quantities in hot or in cold water. But although water of the temperature 60\u00b0 will not dissolve more than 320 or 325 ounces of the purest and driest sea-salt, it will take up above 20 ounces more by boiling on it. When thus saturated to the utmost, and allowed to cool, it does not quit any of it till it is far cooled, viz. near to 60\u00b0. It then deposits this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> salt, and holds the rest till it is just going to freeze, when it lets it go in the infant of freezing. If evaporated in the state in which it continues to hold the salt, it will yield above 400 ounces per cubic foot of brine, in good crystals, but rather overcharged with water. And since in this state the cubic foot of brine weighs about 1220 ounces, it follows, that 820 ounces of water will, by boiling, dissolve 400 of crystallized salt.\n\nThe table shows how much any brine must be boiled down in order to grain. Having observed its specific gravity, find in the table the quantity of salt corresponding. Call this x. Then, since a boiling hot graining or saturated solution contains 340 ounces in the cubic foot of brine, say \\( \\frac{340}{1000} = x : \\frac{1000}{340} x \\). This is the bulk to which every cubic foot (valued at 1000) must be boiled down. Thus suppose the brine has the specific gravity 1109. It holds 160 ounces per foot, and we must boil it down to \\( \\frac{1000 \\times 160}{340} \\) or 471; that is, we must boil off \\( \\frac{529}{1000} \\) of every cubit foot or gallon.\n\nThese remarks are of importance in the manufacture of common salt; they enable us to appreciate the value of salt springs, and to know how far it may be prudent to engage in the manufacture. For the doctrine of latent heat affords us, that in order to boil off a certain quantity of water, a certain quantity of heat is indispensably necessary. After the most judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this heat, the consumption of fuel may be too expensive.\n\nThe specific gravity of sea water in these climates does not exceed 1.03, or the cubic foot weighs 1030 ounces, and it contains about 41 ounces of salt. The brine-pits in England are vastly richer; but in many parts of the world brines are boiled for salt which do not contain above 10 or 20 ounces in the cubic foot.\n\nIn buying salt by weight, it is of importance to know the degree of humidity. A salt will appear pretty dry (if free from magnesian salts) though moistened with one per cent. of water; and it is found that incipient humidity exposes it much to farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DELIQUESCENCE\">deliquescence</a>. A much smaller degree of humidity may be discovered by the specific gravity of a brine made with a few ounces of the salt. And the inspection of the table informs us,\nthat the brine should be weak; for the differences of specific gravity go on diminishing in the stronger brines: 300 ounces of dry salt dissolved in 897 ounces of water should give the specific gravity 1197. Suppose it be but 1190, the quantity of salt corresponding is only 292; but when mixed with 897 ounces of water, the weight is 1197, although the weight of the cubic foot is only 1190. There is therefore more than a cubic foot of the brine, and there is as much salt as will make more than a cubic foot of the weight 1190. There is\n\n\\[ \\frac{290}{1197} \\times \\frac{1197}{1190} = 291\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ ounces}, \\]\n\nand there is 8\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) ounces of water attached to the salt.\n\nThe various informations which we have pointed out as deducible from a knowledge of the specific gravity of the brines of common salt, will serve to suggest several advantages of the knowledge of this circumstance in other lixivias. We shall not therefore refuse them, but simply give another table or two of such as are most interesting. Of those, alkaline leys are the chief, being of extensive use in bleaching, soap-making, glass-making, &c.\n\nWe therefore made a very strong ley of the purest vegetable alkali that is ever used in the manufactories, not thinking it necessary, or even proper, to take it in its state of utmost purity, as obtained from cubic nitre and the like. We took salt of tartar from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHECARY\">apothecary</a>, perfectly dry, of which 3983 grains were dissolved in 3540 grains of distilled water; and after agitation for several days, and then standing to deposit sediment, the clear ley was decanted. It was again agitated; because, when of this strength, it becomes, in a very short time, rarer above and denser at the bottom. A flask containing 4200 grains of water held 6165 of this ley when of the temperature 55\u00b0. Its specific gravity was therefore 1.4678, and the 6165 grains of ley contained 3264 grains of salt. We examined its specific gravity in different states of dilution, till we came to a brine containing 51 grains of salt, and 4180 grains of water, and the contents of the flask weighed 4240 grains: its specific gravity was therefore 1.0095. In this train of experiments the progression was most regular and satisfactory; so that when we constructed the curve of specific gravities geometrically, none of the points deviated from a most regular curve. It was considerably more incurvated near its commencement than the curve for sea-salt, indicating a much greater condensation in the diluted brines.

Thus a brine, of which the cubit foot weighs 1482 ounces, or which has the specific gravity 1.482, contains 800 ounces of dry alkali and 682 of water. Therefore, if we suppose the density of the water unchanged, there remains the bulk of 318 ounces of water to receive 840 ounces of salt: its density is therefore \\( \\frac{800}{318} = 2.512 \\) nearly. But in the brine whose weight per foot is only 1016 there are 20 ounces of salt, and therefore 996 of water; and there is only four ounce-measures of water, that is, the bulk of four ounces of water, to receive 20 ounces of salt. Its specific gravity therefore is \\( \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\), almost twice as great as in the strong brine. Accordingly Mr Achard is disposed to admit the absorption (as it is carelessly termed) in the case of salt tart. But it is a general (we think an universal) fact in the solution of salts. It must be carefully distinguished from the first contraction of bulk which salts undergo in passing from a solid to a fluid form. The contraction now under consideration is analogous to the contraction of oil of vitriol when diluted with water; for oil of vitriol must be considered as a very strong brine which we cannot dephlegmate by distillation, and therefore cannot obtain the dry saline ingredient in a separate form, so as to observe its solid density, and say how much it contracts in first becoming fluid. The way of conceiving the first contraction in the act of solution as a lodging of the particles of the one ingredient on the interstices of the other, \"qu'ils se nichent, en augmentant le poids sans affecter le volume de la saumure,\" as Euler and Lambert express themselves, is impossible here, when both are fluids. Indeed it is but a slovenly way of thinking.\nSpecific Gravity.\n\nthinking in either case, and should be avoided, because inadvertent persons are apt to use as a physical principle what is merely a mode of speech.\n\nWe learn from the table, that a hydrometer with equidistant divisions on a cylindrical or prismatical stem is still more erroneous than in the brines of common salt.\n\nWe learn from the experiments of Kirwan, Lavoisier, and others, that dry salt of tartar contains about one-fourth of its weight of fixed air. In many applications of this salt to the purposes of manufacture, this ingredient is of no use. In some it is hurtful, and must be abstracted by lime. Soap-maker's ley consists of the pure alkaline salt dissolved in water. It is therefore of importance to ascertain its quantity by means of the specific gravity of the brine. For this purpose we took a ley of sal tartar, whose specific gravity was 1.24477, containing 314 ounces of mild alkali in a cubic foot of ley, and we rendered it nearly caustic by lime. The specific gravity was then 1.1897. This is a very unexpected result. Nothing is employed with more success than quicklime for depilating any watery fluid. We should rather have expected an increase of specific gravity by the abstraction of some of the water of the menstruum, and perhaps the water of the crystallization, and the aerial part of the salt. But we must ascribe this to the great density in which the fixed air exists in the mild alkali.\n\nIt is unnecessary to give similar tables for all the salts, unless we were writing a dissertation on the theory of their solution. We shall only observe, that we examined with particular attention sal ammoniac, because Mr Achard, who denies what is called the absorption of salts, finds himself obliged to allow something like it in this salt. It does not, however, differ from those of which we have given an account in detail in any other respect than this, that the changes of fluid density are much less than in others (instead of being greater, as Achard's experiments seem to indicate) in all brines of moderate strength. But in the very weak brines there is indeed a remarkable difference; and if we have not committed an error in our examination, the addition of one part of sal ammoniac to 64 of water occupies less room than the water alone. We think that we have met with this as an accidental remark by some author, whose work we do not recollect. But we do not choose to rest so much on our form of the experiment in such weak brines. The following mixtures will abundantly serve for constructing the table of its strength: Sal ammoniac = 960 grains was dissolved in 3506 grains of water, making a brine of 4466 grains. A phial which held 1600 grains water held 1698 of this brine. It contained\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1698 \\times 960}{4466} = 365 \\text{ grains of salt.}\n\\]\n\nThe specific gravity was\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1698}{1600} = 1.061,\n\\]\n\nand the cubic foot weighed\n\n\\[\n1061 \\text{ ounces.}\n\\]\n\nIt also contained\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1061 \\times 365}{1698} = 288 \\text{ ounces of salt.}\n\\]\n\nBy repeated abstraction of brine, and replacing with water, we had the following series:\n\n| Series | Brine | Sp. Gr. | Oz. Salt | Cub. Ft. Spectacles |\n|--------|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|\n| Weight of brine | 1/8, 1698 | 1.061 | 228 | |\n| After taking out | 2/8, 1676 | 1.048 | 171 | |\n| After taking out | 3/8, 1653 | 1.033 | 114 | |\n| After taking out | 4/8, 1630 | 1.019 | 57 | |\n| After taking out | 5/8, 1616 | 1.010 | 28 | |\n| After taking out | 6/8, 1610 | 1.0063 | 14 | |\n| After taking out | 7/8, 1605 | 1.0038 | 7 | |\n\nThis series is extremely regular, and the progress of density may be confidently deduced from it.\n\nFrom the whole of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a> on the relation between the specific gravities of brines and the quantities of salt contained, we see in general that it may be guessed at, with a useful degree of precision, from the density or specific gravity of saturated solutions. We therefore conclude with a list of the specific gravities of several saturated solutions, made with great care by the bishop of Landaff.\u2014The temperature was 42\u00b0. The first numerical column is the density of saturated brine, and the next is the density of a brine consisting of 12 parts (by weight) of water and one of salt. From this may be inferred the quantity in the saturated solution, and from this again may be inferred the quantity corresponding to inferior densities.\n\n| Borax | 1.910 |\n| Cor.

Old people, and others who have flat eyes, use convex spectacles, which cause the rays of light to converge so as to meet upon the retina; whereas myopes, or short-sighted people, use concave lenses for spectacles, which cause the rays to diverge, and prevent their meeting ere they reach the retina. See OPTICS.\n\nSome cases of a peculiar nature have been met with where the sight receives no assistance from the use of either convex or concave glasses. To remedy this, the following method was contrived and successfully adopted. A man about sixty years of age having almost entirely lost his sight, could see nothing but a kind of thick mist with little black specks in it which seemed to float in the air. He could neither read, walk the streets, nor distinguish his friends who were most familiar to him. In this deplorable situation he procured some spectacles with large rings; and having taken out the glasses,\nSpectacles glasses, he substituted for them a conic tube of black Spanish copper. Looking through the large end of the cone he could read the smallest print placed at its other extremity. These tubes were of different lengths, and the openings at the end were also of different sizes; the smaller the aperture the better could he distinguish the smallest letters; the larger the aperture the more words or lines it commanded; and consequently the less occasion was there for moving the head and the hand in reading. Sometimes he used one eye, sometimes the other, alternately relieving each, for the rays of the two eyes could not unite upon the same object when thus separated by two opaque tubes. The thinner these tubes, the less troublesome they are. They must be totally blackened within so as to prevent all shining, and they should be made to lengthen or contract, and enlarge or reduce the aperture at pleasure.\n\nWhen he placed convex glasses in these tubes, the letters indeed appeared larger, but not so clear and distinct as through the empty tube: he also found the tubes more convenient when not fixed in the spectacles rings; for when they hung loosely they could be raised or lowered with the hand, and one or both might be used as occasion required. It is almost needless to add, that the material of the tubes is of no importance, and that they may be made of iron or tin as well as of copper, provided the inside of them be sufficiently blackened.*\n\n*Monthly Mag. 1799.\n\nOcular SPECTRA, images presented to the eye after removing them from a bright object, or closing them. When any one has long and attentively looked at a bright object, as at the setting sun, on closing his eyes, or removing them, an image, which resembles in form the object he was attending to, continues some time to be visible. This appearance in the eye we shall call the ocular spectrum of that object.\n\nThese ocular spectra are of four kinds: 1st, Such as are owing to a less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of a defined part of the retina, or spectra from defect of sensibility. 2d, Such as are owing to a greater sensibility of a defined part of the retina, or spectra from excess of sensibility. 3d, Such as resemble their object in its colour as well as form; which may be termed direct ocular spectra. 4th, Such as are of a colour contrary to that of their object, which may be termed reverse ocular spectra.","sp":184,"ep":185},{"h":"SPECTRE","t":"an apparition, or something supposed to be supernaturally visible to human sight, whether the ghosts of dead men or beings superior to man.\n\nA belief that supernatural beings sometimes make themselves visible, and that the dead sometimes revisit the living, has prevailed among most nations, especially in the rudest stages of society. It was common among the Jews, among the Greeks, and among the Romans, as we find from the Scriptures, and from the poems of Homer and Virgil. Celestial appearances were indeed so often exhibited to the Jews, that the origin of their belief is not difficult to be explained.\u2014The Divine Being manifested himself to each of the patriarchs by some sensible sign, generally by a flame of fire, as he did to Moses. Under this semblance also did he appear to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a> during their abode in the desert, and after they obtained a settlement in the land of Canaan. Nor did they believe that heavenly beings alone assumed a sensible appearance: They believed that deceased men also sometimes revisited this world. When Saul went to consult the witch at Endor, he asked her to bring up the person whom he should name unto her; a proof that he considered his demand as easy to be performed, and therefore that he probably acted under the influence of popular opinion. The same opinions had been generally entertained at a much earlier period; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECROMANCY\">necromancy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>, the arts by which the dead were supposed to be raised, had been prohibited while the Israelites were in the wilderness, and yet untainted with the vices of the Canaanites. They must therefore have derived them from Egypt, the cradle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, as well as of the arts and sciences.\n\nAmong the Greeks and Romans the apparition of spectres was generally believed. On innumerable occasions the gods are said to have discovered themselves to the eyes of mortals, to have held conferences, and to have interposed their aid. The ghosts of the dead, too, are said to have appeared. When \u00c6neas, amidst the distraction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of his mind in flying from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of Troy, had lost his wife by the way, he returned in search of her. Her shade appeared to him (for she herself had been slain) with the same aspect as before, but her figure was larger. She endeavoured to assuage the grief of her unhappy husband, by ascribing her death to the appointment of the gods, and by foretelling the illustrious honours which yet awaited him. But when \u00c6neas attempted to clasp her in his arms, the phantom immediately vanished into air. From this story we may observe, that the ancients believed that the shades or shades, retained nearly the same appearance after death as before; that they had so far the resemblance of a body as to be visible; that they could think and speak as formerly, but could not be touched. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> applies equally well to those shades which had passed the river Styx, and taken up their residence in the infernal regions. Such were the shades of Dido, of Deiphobus, and all those which \u00c6neas met with in his journey through the subterraneous world.\n\nIt appears from the writings of modern travellers who have visited rude and savage nations, that the belief of spectres is no less common among them. Mr Bruce tells us, that the priest of the Nile affirmed, that he had more than once seen the spirit of the river in the form of an old man with a white beard. Among the Mahometans the doctrine of spectres seems to be reduced to a regular system, by the accounts which they give of genii. Whoever has read the Arabian Nights Entertainments must have furnished his memory with a thousand instances of this kind. Their opinions concerning genii seem to be a corrupted mixture of the doctrines of the Jews and ancient Persians. In Christian countries, too, notwithstanding the additional light which their religion has spread, and the great improvement in the sciences to which it has been subservient, the belief of ghosts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARITIONS\">apparitions</a> is very general, especially among the lower ranks. They believe that evil spirits sometimes make their appearance in order to terrify wicked men, especially those who have committed murder. They suppose that the spirits of dead men assume a corporeal appearance, hover about church-yards and the houses of the deceased, or haunt the places where murders have been committed. (See GHOST.) In some places it is believed that beings have been seen bearing a perfect resemblance to men alive. In the Highlands of Scotland, what is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND_SIGHT\">second sight</a> is still believed.\nlieved by many (see SECOND Sight); viz. that future events are foretold by certain individuals by means of spectral representation.\n\nSo general has the belief of spectres been, that this circumstance alone may be thought by some sufficient to prove that it must have its foundation in human nature, or must rest upon rational evidence. When any doctrine has been universally received by all nations, by generations living several thousand years from one another, and by people in all the different stages of society, there is certainly the strongest presumption to conclude that such a doctrine has its foundation in reason and in truth. In this way we argue in favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a God, concerning moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, and the doctrine of a future state; and certainly so far we argue well. But if the same argument be applied to idolatry, to sacrifices, or to apparitions, we shall find that it is applied improperly. Idolatry was very general among ancient nations; so was the offering of sacrifices, so was polytheism: but they were by no means <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>. Should we allow, for the sake of shortening the argument, that all ancient nations were polytheists and idolaters, and presented oblations to their imaginary deities, all that could be concluded from this concession is, that they fell into these mistakes from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and from the rude state of society, from which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> knowledge of theology and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a> was never able to rescue them. These erroneous notions fled before the brightness of the Christian system; while the doctrines of the existence of God, of moral distinction, and of a future state, have been more thoroughly confirmed and ascertained. The same thing may be said of the belief of spectres. However generally it has been adopted in the first stages of society, or by civilized nations who had made but little progress in the study of divine things, it has been rejected, we may say invariably, wherever theology and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> have gone hand in hand.\n\nAs all popular and long established opinions are objects of curiosity and research for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, we think the belief of spectres worthy of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> even in this light. It will therefore, we hope, give some satisfaction to the philosophical reader to see a short account of the sources or principles from which this belief is derived. But as the belief of spectres is connected with other opinions which appear to us highly injurious to religion; opinions which have been supported by many learned men, and which are still believed by some men of literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>\u2014it will also be proper, in the first place, to consider the evidence on which this belief rests, in which we must consider both their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">credibility</a>.\n\nIn the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> we mean to set aside altogether the celestial appearances recorded in Scripture, as being founded on unquestionable evidence, and perfectly agreeable to those rules by which the Deity acts in the usual course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>. The Israelites, during the existence of their state, were immediately under the authority of God, not only as the moral governor of the world, but as the king of Israel. In the infancy of the world, while men were rude and unenlightened, and entirely under the influence of idolatry, many revelations were necessary to preserve in their minds pure ideas of the nature of God, and of the worship due to Him. They were necessary also to pave the way for that illustrious dispensation which the Lord Jesus came from Heaven to diffuse over the world. Every celestial appearance recorded in Scripture was exhibited for some wise and important purpose, which must be apparent to every person who considers these appearances with attention. But when the Scriptures were written and published, and the Christian religion fully established, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> ceased, and miracles and heavenly messages were no longer requisite. What credit then ought we to give to those marvellous stories related in ancient authors concerning prodigies in the heavens, and the apparition of angels both good and bad?\n\nIt is not pretended that any of those prodigies and appearances were exhibited for purposes equally great and important with those which are described in Scripture: And can we suppose that the all-wise Governor of the world would permit his angels to render themselves visible to the eye of man for no purpose at all, or for a purpose which might have been equally well accomplished without their intervention? Would this be consistent with perfect wisdom, or would it be consistent even with the excellence and superiority of understanding which we are taught to ascribe to those elevated beings? The whole will of God is revealed to us in the Scriptures; what further use for the visible interposition of angels? It may be objected, Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>? We answer, That angels may animate and support good men by an invisible intervention. But the Apostle is not speaking of celestial spirits. The word \u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 signifies \"a messenger,\" and in Scripture often refers to men. In the passage which we are now reviewing it certainly is applied with much more propriety to men than to angels: for the Apostle is stating a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the Prophets, by whom God, at sundry times and in divers manners, spake in time past to the fathers, and the Son, by whom he hath spoken in these last days.\n\nAnd if God has given no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to his angels to deliver to men since the publication of the Christian religion, is there any probability that he would give any commission or any licence to evil spirits? It will be said, that this doctrine is clearly taught in the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, in these words, \"The devil goeth about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.\" We will not avail ourselves of the interpretation of some, who say that the word devil, which in the Greek language signifies an adversary, or slanderer, refers here to some human being, who was a violent enemy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. All that can be deduced from these words, upon the supposition that they refer to a malignant spirit, is merely that he goeth about seducing men to vice. But it is not by assuming a hideous form, and pretending himself to the midnight traveller, that such a purpose is to be accomplished. A spirit may probably have direct access to our minds without the intervention of anything corporeal; and by exciting our passions may plunge us into vice, which is the only object such a being is supposed to have in view. None of the marvellous stories which we have heard concerning the apparition of evil spirits lead us to conclude that they appear to entice men to commit crimes. We never heard of any evil spirits that required men to steal, to perpetrate robbery or murder. They only appeared to terrify some crazy timorous individuals, who have whims and fancies enough.\nknow of their own to agitate their minds, though no preternatural vision should ever appear to them. It is not consistent, therefore, with the character of God, and what he has revealed to us of his will, to believe that he would commission good angels, or permit evil angels, to appear to men since the propagation of the gospel, or indeed at any former period of the world, unless some great and mighty purpose was to be fulfilled. It is not consistent with what we know of the nature of good or bad angels to suppose, that though permission were granted them occasionally to show themselves to men, that they would appear in that way which storytellers describe.\n\nIt is equally improbable that the spirits of the dead who have removed from this world should again be permitted to visit it. At death men undergo as great, perhaps a greater change, than when they came first into the light of the sun. Is it not therefore as improbable that a man should return in a visible corporeal form after death, as that, after having arrived at manhood, he should return to the state in which he was before his birth? Such changes as these are evidently made permanent by the invariable laws of nature. But suppose it were possible, for what purpose should they return? To describe to us what is passing in the other world, to animate us to virtue, by informing us of the rewards which there await the good; or to alarm us, by describing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the wicked. These seem important reasons. But Divine Providence has wisely thrown a veil over futurity. We know everything of the other world from the scripture which it is proper for us at present to know. And as to incentives to virtue, we are already blessed with a number sufficiently great and powerful for moral beings, who are to act from rational motives, and not from compulsion. \"He that will not hear Moses and the prophets, will not be persuaded though one rose from the dead.\"\n\nThere is one strong objection against the probability of spectres, which is sufficient to prove that they are not intelligent creatures; or at least that they possess so small a degree of intelligence, that they are unqualified to act with prudence, to propose any end to themselves, or use the proper means to accomplish that end. Ghosts often appear in order to discover some crime that has been committed: but they never appear to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, or person in authority, but to some illiterate clown, who happens to live near the place where the crime was perpetrated; to some person who has no connection with the affair at all, and who in general is the most improper in the world for making the discovery. For instance, in Glanville's *Saducifmus triumphatus* (a book written in the last century by a chaplain of Charles II. in support of the common opinions respecting witchcraft and apparitions), we have the following story: James Haddock, a farmer, was married to Elenor Welsh, by whom he had a son. After the death of Haddock, his wife married one Davis; and both agreed to defraud the son by the former marriage of a lease bequeathed to him by his father. Upon this the ghost of Haddock appeared to one Francis Taverner the servant of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a>, and desired him to go to Elenor Welsh, and to inform her that it was the will of her former husband that their son should enjoy the lease. Taverner did not at first execute this commission; but he was continually haunted by the apparition in the most hideous shapes, which even threatened to tear him in pieces, till at last he delivered the message. Now, had this spectre had the least common sense, it would have appeared first to Elenor Welsh and her husband Davis, and frightened them into compliance at once, and not have kept poor Taverner in such constant disquietude, who had no concern in the matter.\n\nAnother very odd circumstance reflecting apparitions in general must not be omitted, which is, that they have no power to speak till they are addressed. In the 27th of Glanville's Relations we read of an old woman that appeared often to David Hunter, a neat-herd, at the house of the bishop of Down and Conners. Whenever she appeared, he found himself obliged to follow her; and for three quarters of a year poor David spent the whole of almost every night in scampering up and down through the woods after this old woman. How long this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> employment might have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to guess, had not David's violent fatigue made him one night exclaim, \"Lord bless me! Would I were dead\u2014shall I never be delivered from this misery!\" On which the phantom replied, \"Lord bless me too! It was happy you spoke first, for till then I had no power to speak, though I have followed you too long.\" Then she gave him a message to her two sons, though David told her he remembered nothing about her. David, it seems, neglected to deliver the message; at which the old hag was so much provoked, that she returned and hit him a hearty blow on the shoulder, which made him cry out, and then speak to her. Now if she could not speak till David addressed her, why might she not have applied this oratorical medicine the first time she appeared to him? It would have saved both herself and him many a weary journey; and certainly David would much rather have had even half a dozen of blows from her choppy fists than have wanted so many nights sleep. To complete the story, we must add, that when David's wife found it impossible to keep him from following the troublesome visitor, she trudged after him, but never was gratified with a sight of the enchantress. David's little dog too was a dutiful attendant on his matter during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIMAGE\">pilgrimage</a>.\n\nIt is remarked by Glanville, that ghosts are generally very eager to be gone. Indeed they are often so much so, that they do not stay to tell their errand. One would be induced from this, as well as the circumstances already mentioned, to think that they are the stupidest and dullest of the dead that assume the appearance of ghosts; unless we adopt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> solution of Glanville, \"that it is a very hard and painful thing for them to force their thin and tenuous bodies into a visible consistence; that their bodies must needs be exceedingly comprimised; and that therefore they must be in haste to be delivered from the unnatural pressure.\"\n\nWith respect to the evidence in favour of spectres, if examined ever so slightly, it will be found very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. They only appear to one person at a time; they are seen only in the night; they are visible only to ignorant, illiterate, and credulous persons, and never present themselves before men of education and learning. That spectres only appear to one person at a time, even though there are more in company, is an objection against the credibility of their appearance quite infur-\n\nVol. XIX. Part II,\nmountable. How is it possible that two men of eyesight equally good, directing their eyes to the same spot, should not see so large an object as that of a man or woman at a small distance equally well? Some will tell us that a mist is cast over the eyes of the one, while the view of the other is free from obstruction. But how is this to be proved? And besides, what purpose would it serve? Ghosts have seldom any secrets to disclose; they might be proclaimed to a multitude with as much propriety as confined to one person. Shall we be told, that the spectre has the power of becoming visible to some, and of remaining invisible to others? This cannot be allowed without adopting opinions destructive to revealed religion; for it would be a miracle: and we cannot be persuaded, without evidence, that God would empower any inferior being to controul at pleasure the wise laws which he has ordained for governing the world. To him who is of a different opinion, we would recommend Farmer on Miracles; a book in which this question is fully examined.\n\nSpectres appear only in the night. But why should they shun the light of the sun? Those mischievous ghosts that Glanville mentions might indeed have some reason to choose midnight for the execution of their pranks, as they would be more easily detected in open day. Such was the rough drummer that haunted Mr Mompesson's house, who beat his drum all night, threw the old gentlewoman's clothes about the room, hid her Bible in the ashes, plucked the clothes off the bed, and amused himself with telling about Mr Mompesson's shoes. But why should a grave serious ghost appear at midnight? Might it not deliver its message with as much ease and more success in the day-time? In the day-time it would not excite much fear; it would be listened to therefore with more attention; and did it choose to exhibit itself before a number of witnesses, its grievances would be more speedily redressed, because more persons would interest themselves in seeing justice done to the injured ghost.\n\nSpectres not only choose the most improper time, but the most improper persons. To render the testimony of any person credible, he must not only be a man of veracity, but he must have sufficient ability to judge of the subject to which he is to bear witness. It is not on the evidence of an ignorant illiterate person, who has more fancy and fear than judgement, that we are to rest our belief of what is supernatural. It is also worthy of remark, that we have never heard of a ghost appearing to any person who did not previously believe their existence. A man must be prejudiced in favour of this opinion, or he will never see a ghost. But sensible men know, that he who has been accustomed to hear frightful stories of ghosts and apparitions gliding through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCHYARD\">churchyard</a>, or haunting some particular place, can scarcely pass through a churchyard, or haunted spot without conjuring up in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> the hideous phantoms which he has been accustomed to associate with such places. Is it strange, then, that an ignorant man, with a mind uncultivated and uninformed, with all the prejudices of the nursery about him, should imagine he sees ghosts in those places where he believes they hover, especially in the dead hour of midnight, when, with the slightest aid of the imagination, a cow may be turned into a monstrous phantom, and the reflection of the beams of the moon from a little water be converted into a ghost with a winding-sheet? But why should apparitions than men of understanding and learning? Why should learning be formidable to them (A)? It was not so with the celestial messengers mentioned in the Scriptures: they appeared to the patriarchs and prophets; and the miracles there recorded were performed in the most public places, before the eyes of Rabbies, of Scribes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>. Indeed this circumstance is sufficient to destroy the evidence of spectres. They have never been seen by any but men of weak or disordered minds, or by men who have previously believed in them.\n\nHaving now considered the evidence on which the belief of spectres rests, we will endeavour to give some account of the foundation of it. To trace an opinion that has prevailed so generally in the world to its source, is a labour not unworthy of the philosopher, even though the opinion be false. It is always gratifying to detect the causes of error: it is no less useful; for in order to refute error, it is often sufficient to point out the sources from which it has sprung. To reach the origin of the belief of spectres is not more difficult than to account for idolatry or polytheism. In the infant state of the intellectual powers every thing is considered as possessing life and intelligence. The child beats the stool\n\n(A) The celebrated historian De Thou had a very singular adventure at Saumur, in the year 1598. One night, having retired to rest very much fatigued, while he was enjoying a sound sleep, he felt a very extraordinary weight upon his feet, which, having made him turn suddenly, fell down and awakened him. At first he imagined that it had been only a dream, but hearing soon after some noise in his chamber, he drew aside the curtains and saw, by help of the moon, which at that time shone very bright, a large white figure walking up and down, and at the same time observed upon a chair some rags, which he thought belonged to thieves who had come to rob him. The figure then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> his bed, he had the courage to ask it what it was. \"I am (said it) the Queen of Heaven.\" Had such a figure appeared to any credulous ignorant man in the dead of night, and made such a speech, would he not have trembled with fear, and have frightened the whole neighbourhood with a marvellous description of it? But De Thou had too much understanding to be so imposed upon. Upon hearing the words which dropped from the figure, he immediately concluded that it was some mad woman, got up, called his servants, and ordered them to turn her out of doors; after which he returned to bed and fell asleep. Next morning he found that he had not been deceived in his conjecture, and that having forgot to shut his door, this female figure had escaped from her keepers, and entered his apartment. The brave Schomberg, to whom De Thou related his adventure some days after, confessed that in such a case he would not have shown so much courage. The king also, who was informed of it by Schomberg, made the same acknowledgment.\nSpectre. stool over which he has fallen with the same passion that he would treat his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>: The young girl talks to her doll as if it understood her: The savages ascribe every change which they observe on the face of nature to the action of some animated being. As knowledge advances, they fingle out those beings which seem to produce the most striking effects, arrange them into some kind of order, and divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the world among them. Unable, at the same time, to conceive any notion of a pure spirit, they imagine those divinities are corporeal beings. This is the foundation of idolatry. The belief of spectres is but another step. That these animated corporeal beings, to whom they address their prayers, and who preside over the world, should on particular occasions display themselves to the human eye, is what they must be previously disposed to expect. Hence the numberless appearances of the heathen gods, of the Persian and Mahometan genii. The belief of ghosts may be easily deduced from the opinions entertained respecting a future state. These opinions are founded on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> doctrine of natural religion, that there is another world in which men shall exist when death has removed them hence. This doctrine has been universally received both by savage and civilized nations; but, as might be expected, men have formed very different sentiments concerning the nature of a future state, of the situation and employments of departed spirits, according to the degree of knowledge which they possessed. But the general opinion in ancient and rude nations was, that departed spirits retained the same external appearance, the same passions and principles as before. Nothing therefore was more natural than the opinion, that they might occasionally revisit this world, from an anxious desire to alleviate the sufferings of those beloved friends and relations whom they had left behind them, or to communicate from the unseen world what might be important to their welfare. Upon such an errand did Cre\u00fcla appear to \u00c6neas.\n\nThe apparition of the ghosts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a> is easily explained upon the same general principles. The remorse and horror of mind which the murderer feels are supposed to haunt him in the other world, and to render his situation intolerable (especially if the murder was never detected and punished), till he return and give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> against himself. In this way, then, we think it highly probable the belief of spectres has originated. But many other causes concur to confirm and propagate this belief. These are, imperfect vision united with fear, dreams, opium, diseases, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, and opium.\n\n1. Indistinct vision is one source of apparitions, especially when the mind is under the influence of fear. It is well known, that the sense of seeing conveys no idea of distance till improved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; and how we come at length to distinguish objects at a distance from those that are near, has been explained in another place (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, No. 50.).\n\nIn the daytime we seldom commit mistakes, because we know the object at which we look; but at night, when we see objects obscurely, and know not what they are, we have no distinct idea either of their distances or of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>. We may mistake a bush that is near us for a tree at a distance; or if the imagination be under the influence of fear, it will easily convert it into a gigantic figure. \"It is generally asserted (says Buffon) that these figures exist only in the imagination; yet they may have a real existence in the eye; for whenever we have no other mode of judging of an unknown object but by the angle it forms in the eye, its magnitude will uniformly increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to its propinquity. If it appears, when at the distance of 20 or 30 paces, to be only a few feet high, its height, when within two or three feet of the eye, will be many fathoms. An object of this kind must naturally excite terror and astonishment in the spectator, till he approaches and recognizes it by actual feeling; for the moment a man knows an object, the gigantic appearance it assumed in the eye instantly diminishes, and its apparent magnitude is reduced to its real dimensions. But if, instead of approaching such an object, the spectator flies from it, he can have no other idea of it but from the image which it formed in his eye; and, in this case, he may affirm with truth that he saw an object terrible in its aspect, and enormous in its size. Thus the notions concerning spectres is founded in nature, and depend not, as some philosophers affirm, upon the imagination alone.\"\n\nIn addition to these observations of Buffon, we may take notice, that objects are always magnified in a fog; so that when a fog happens in the night-time, objects may be magnified to an enormous size. But, at any rate, whether there be fog in the night or not, there is such a great analogy between darkness and a fog, that if the latter deceive us with respect to the size of objects, the former will also deceive us. The writer of this article was passing the frith of Forth at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEENSFERRY\">Queensferry</a>, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, one morning which was extremely foggy. Though the water be only two miles broad, the boat did not get within sight of the southern shore till it approached very near it. He then saw to his great surprise a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> rock, where he knew the shore was low and almost flat. As the boat advanced a little nearer, the rock seemed to split perpendicularly into portions, which separated at a little distance from one another. He next saw these perpendicular divisions move; and upon approaching a little nearer, found it was a number of people standing on the beach, waiting the arrival of the ferry-boat.\n\n2. Dreams are another fertile source of apparitions. It is well known to every person, that while the mind is under the influence of a dream it considers it as much a reality as it does any particular action while awake. Now if a person of a weak superstitious mind should have a very lively dream, which interests his passions, particularly the passion of fear, it may make so deep an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, that he may be firmly convinced that he has actually seen with his eyes what has only passed before his imagination (see Apparition) (B). We shall here tell a story, by way of illustration, which we have\n\n---\n\n(B) When the thoughts are much troubled, and when a person sleeps without the circumstances of going to bed, or putting off his clothes, as when he nods in his chair, it is very difficult, as Hobbes remarks, to distinguish a dream from a reality. On the contrary, he that composes himself to sleep, in case of any uncouth or absurd fancy, easily suspects it to have been a dream.\u2014Leviathan, par. i. c. i.\nhave received on unquestionable authority. An East India captain had an honest faithful servant named John, for whom he had a great regard. John died, if we recollect right, on a voyage from England to the East Indies during a French war. As the ship approached the place of its destination the captain had a dream, in which John appeared to him, and earnestly besought him not to fail to the port for which he was bound, as it was in the hands of the French. The captain, though not addicted to superstition, thought it prudent to follow this admonition; and after landing at a different port, he was informed that the place to which he had intended to steer was, according to the information of the dream, captured by the French. On the voyage home, the captain had a second dream, in which John again appeared to him, and gave him notice that he should soon die, and that the ship should be taken in the mouth of the Channel by the French. Next morning the captain called his first mate, told him his dream, which he believed was prophetic, and delivered his papers, that he might take proper care of them after his decease. Every thing happened exactly as the dream had foretold; the captain died, and the vessel was taken by a French man of war in the mouth of the Channel. This dream, wonderful as it appears, is easily explained. In the voyage out to India, nothing was more natural than that the captain should sometimes be thinking, that amidst the various chances of war, the port to which he was bound might be taken; perhaps it was a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, which the French might be eager to possess. The captain being accustomed to resolve these thoughts in the day-time, they would naturally return at night; the regret which he felt for the loss of a faithful servant might mingle with his apprehensions, and thus produce the dream. Perhaps the advice was such as John would have given had he been alive. It is equally easy to explain the cause of the dream in the passage home. The captain, we are told, was very ill, and thought himself dying, at the very time he had the second dream, and therefore did not expect to reach England. This part of the dream, then, was only his own thoughts, delivered by his servant. As to the other part, that his ship should be taken in the mouth of the Channel, it may be thought unaccountable how the very place should be foreseen. But we must recollect, that the mouth of the Channel, being over against the coast of France, was by far the most dangerous place in the whole passage; and that, therefore, the captain had more reason to be afraid of losing his ship there than in any other place. The use which we mean to make of this story is this: Had the captain been a man of a weak mind, he would certainly have considered the dream as a reality, and believed that, instead of having dreamed of the things on which his imagination had dwelt, he had actually seen his servant return from the dead, and heard him deliver the message. But, on the other hand, the captain, though he believed the dream was prophetic, mentioned it without any signs of fear; and no man of courage and reflection ever sees an apparition. This flight is reserved for the weak, the timid, and the superstitious. Of this many instances might be mentioned.\n\n3. Spectres are also sometimes occasioned by opium. Gaffendi the philosopher found a number of people going to put a man to death for having intercourse with the devil; a crime which the poor wretch readily acknowledged. Gaffendi begged of the people that they would permit him first to examine the wizard before putting him to death. They did so; and Gaffendi, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, found that the man firmly believed himself guilty of this impossible crime. He even offered to Gaffendi to introduce him to the devil. The philosopher agreed; and when midnight came, the man gave him a pill, which he said it was necessary to swallow before setting off. Gaffendi took the pill, but gave it to his dog. The man having swallowed his, fell into a profound sleep; during which he seemed much agitated by dreams. The dog was affected in a similar manner. When the man awoke, he congratulated Gaffendi on the favourable reception he had met with from his fable highness. It was with difficulty Gaffendi convinced him that the whole was a dream, the effect of soporific medicines, and that he had never stirred from one spot during the whole night.\n\n4. That diseases, especially the night-mare, the hypochondria, hysterical passion, and madness, are another source of spectres, we have the strongest reason to affirm. Persons subject to the night-mare often imagine that they see spectres. This is still more the case with hypochondriacal and hysterical persons, and those who are in any degree deranged in their intellects. A fact which fell within the observation of the writer of this article will both prove and illustrate this assertion. In a village in one of the midland counties of Scotland, lived a widow distinguished among her neighbours for decency of manners, integrity, and respect for religion. She affirmed, that for several nights together she had heard a supernatural voice exclaiming aloud, Murder! murder! This was immediately reported through the neighbourhood; all were alarmed, and looked around them with solicitude for the detection of the murder which they supposed to have been committed; and it was not long till a discovery seemed actually to be made. It was reported, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, who had relations at no great distance, and had been residing in the West Indies, had lately arrived with a considerable fortune; that he had lodged in an inn about three miles off; and that he had afterwards been seen entering a house in the village where the widow lived, from which he had never returned. It was next affirmed, that a tradesman passing the churchyard about twelve at midnight had seen four men carry a dead corpse into that cemetery. These three facts being joined together seemed perfectly to agree and to confirm one another, and all believed some horrible murder had been committed. The relations of the gentleman thought they were called upon to make inquiry into the truth of these allegations; they accordingly came first to the churchyard, where, in company with the sexton, they examined all the graves with great care, in order to discover whether any of them had been lately dug, or had the appearance of containing more than one coffin. But this search was to no purpose, for no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> had been made upon the graves. It was next reported that the murdered man had been buried in a plantation about a mile distant from the village. As the alarm was now very general, a number of the inhabitants professed of their own accord to explore it. They accordingly spread themselves over the wood, and searched it with care, but no grave nor new dug earth was found. The writer of this article, who was then a boy at school, was along with them. The mat-\nter did not rest here: The person who was said to have seen four men carry a dead corpse into the churchyard at midnight was summoned to appear before a meeting of the justices of the peace. Upon examination he denied any knowledge of the affair, but referred the court to another person from whom he had received his information. This person was examined, and the result was the same as the former. In short, one person had heard it from another, who had received it from a third, who had heard it from a fourth; but it had received a little embellishment from every person who repeated it. It turned out to be the same with Smollet's story of the three black crows, which some body was said to have vomited.\n\nUpon inquiry at the inn where the West Indian gentleman had lodged, no such gentleman had been seen there. It was found afterwards he had never left the West Indies. Still, however, the veracity of the widow was not disputed; and some dark and secret transaction was suspected. But the whole affair was at length explained by discovering that she was somewhat deranged by melancholy. And the cries which she had at first imagined she had heard were afterwards imitated by some rogueish person, who was highly amused with spreading terror among the credulous.\n\n5. Drunkenness also has the power of creating spectres. Its natural effect in most cases is to derange the understanding, to throw it off its guard, and to give full scope to that passion which has a natural disposition to gain an ascendancy; and sometimes it excites passions which scarcely seem to exist at any other time. It makes some men licentious, some furious, some all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> and kindness, some from being cowards it renders undaunted heroes. It seldom, if ever, excites fear; and therefore it may be thought strange that men should imagine they see ghosts when intoxicated. But it must be remarked, that the ghouls which the drunkard sees, he sees not with the same alarm and terror as men who are sober. He is not afraid of them. He has the courage to converse with them, and even to fight with them, if they give him provocation. A man returning home intoxicated, affirmed that he had met with the devil; and that after a severe encounter he had vanquished him and brought him to the ground, to which he had nailed him fast by driving his staff through his body. Next morning the staff was found stuck with great violence into a heap of turfs!\n\n6. Many apparitions of spectres have no other origin than the artifices of the waggish or self-interested. Dr Plot, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, relates a marvellous story, which will illustrate this assertion. Soon after the murder of King Charles I. a commission was appointed to survey the king's house at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOODSTOCK\">Woodstock</a>, with the manor, park, woods, and other demesnes to that manor belonging; and one Collins, under a feigned name, hired himself as secretary to the commissioners, who, upon the 13th of October 1649, met, and took up their residence in the king's own rooms. His majesty's bed-chamber they made their kitchen, the council hall their pantry, and the presence-chamber was the place where they sat for the dispatch of business. His majesty's dining-room they made their wood yard, and stored it with the wood of the famous royal-oak from the High Park, which, that nothing might be left with the name of king about it, they had dug up by the roots, and split and bundled up into faggots for their firing. Things being thus prepared, they sat on the 16th of the same month for the dispatch of business; and in the midst of their first debate there entered a large black dog (as they thought), which made a dreadful howling, overturned two or three of their chairs, and then crept under a bed and vanished. This gave them the greater surprise, as the doors were kept constantly locked, so that no real dog could get in or out. The next day their surprise was increased, when fitting at dinner in a lower room, they heard plainly the noise of persons walking over their heads, though they well knew the doors were all locked, and there could be no body there. Presently after they heard also all the wood of the king's oak brought by parcels from the dining-room, and thrown with great violence into the presence chamber; as also all the chairs, stools, tables, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, forcibly hurried about the room; their papers containing the minutes of their transactions were torn, and the ink-glass broken. When all this noise had ceased, Giles Sharp, their secretary, proposed to enter first into these rooms; and in presence of the commissioners, from whom he received the key, he opened the doors, and found the wood spread about the room, the chairs toiled about and broken, the papers torn, the ink-glass broken (as has been said), but not the least track of any human creature, nor the least reason to suspect one, as the doors were all fast, and the keys in the custody of the commissioners. It was therefore unanimously agreed, that the power who did this mischief must have entered the room at the key-hole. The night following, Sharp the secretary, with two of the commissioners servants, as they were in bed in the same room, which room was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to that where the commissioners lay, had their bed's feet lifted up so much higher than their heads, that they expected to have their necks broken, and then they were let fall at once with so much violence as shook the whole house, and more than ever terrified the commissioners. On the night of the 19th, as all were in bed in the same room for greater safety, and lights burning by them, the candles in an instant went out with a sulphurous smell; and that moment many trenchers of wood were hurled about the room, which next morning were found to be the same their honours had eaten on the day before, which were all removed from the pantry, though not a lock was found opened in the whole house. The next night they fared still worse; the candles went out as before; the curtains of their honours beds were rattled to and fro with great violence; their honours received many cruel blows and bruises, by eight great pewter-dishes and a number of wooden trenchers being thrown on their beds, which being heaved off, were heard rolling about the room, though in the morning none of these were to be seen. This night likewise they were alarmed with the tumbling down of oaken billets about their beds, and other frightful noises; but all was clear in the morning, as if no such thing happened. The next night the keeper of the king's house and his dog lay in the commissioners room, and then they had no disturbance. But on the night of the 22d, though the dog lay in the room as before, yet the candles went out, a number of brick-bats fell from the chimney into the room, the dog howled piteously, their bed clothes were all stripped off, and their terror increased. On the\n24th they thought all the wood of the king's oak was violently thrown down by their bed sides; they counted 64 billets that fell, and some hit and shook the beds in which they lay; but in the morning none were found there, nor had the door been opened where the billet wood was kept. The next night the candles were put out; the curtains rattled, and a dreadful crack like thunder was heard; and one of the servants running in haste, thinking his master was killed, found three dozen of trenchers laid smoothly under the quilt by him. But all this was nothing to what succeeded afterwards: The 29th, about midnight, the candles went out, something walked majestically through the room, and opened and shut the windows; great stones were thrown violently into the room, some of which fell on the beds, others on the floor; and at about a quarter after one a noise was heard as of forty cannon discharged together, and again repeated at about eight minutes distance. This alarmed and raised all the neighbourhood, who coming into their honours room, gathered up the great stones, four score in number, and laid them by in the corner of a field, where, in Dr Plot's time, who reports this story, they were to be seen. This noise, like the discharge of cannon, was heard through all the country for 16 miles round. During these noises, which were heard in both rooms together, the commissioners and their servants gave one another over for lost, and cried out for help; and Giles Sharp, snatching up a sword, had well nigh killed one of their honours, mistaking him for the spirit, as he came in his shirt from his own room to theirs. While they were together, the noise was continued, and part of the tiling of the house was stript off, and all the windows of an upper room were taken away with it. On the 30th at midnight something walked into the chamber treading like a bear; it walked many times about, then threw the warming-pan violently on the floor; at the same time a large quantity of broken glass, accompanied with great stones and horse bones, came pouring into the room with uncommon force. These were all found in the morning to the astonishment and terror of the commissioners, who were yet determined to go on with their business. But on the first of November the most dreadful scene of all ensued: Candles in every part of the room were lighted up, and a great fire made; at midnight, the candles all yet burning, a noise like the bursting of a cannon was heard in the room, and the burning billets were tossed about by it even into their honours beds; who called Giles and his companions to their relief, otherwise the house had been burnt to the ground; about an hour after the candles went out as usual, the crack as if many cannon was heard, and many pailfuls of green flinging water were thrown upon their honours beds; great stones were also thrown in as before, the bed curtains and bedsteads torn and broken, the windows shattered, and the whole neighbourhood alarmed with the most dreadful noises; nay, the very rabbit-stealers that were abroad that night in the warren were so terrified, that they fled for fear and left their ferrets behind them. One of their honours this night spoke, and, in the name of God, asked what it was, and why it disturbed them so? No answer was given to this; but the noise ceased for a while, when the spirit came again; and, as they all agreed, brought with it seven devils worse than itself. One of the servants now lighted a large candle, and set it in the door-way between the two chambers, to see what passed; and as he watched it, he plainly saw a hoof striking the candle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLESTICK\">candlestick</a> into the middle of the room, and afterwards making three scrapes over the snuff, scraped it out. Upon this the same person was so bold as to draw a sword; but he had scarce got it out when he felt another invisible hand holding it too, and pulling it from him; and at length prevailing, struck him so violently on the head with the pommel, that he fell down for dead with the blow. At this instant was heard another burst like the discharge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BROADSIDE\">broadside</a> of a ship of war, and at about a minute or two's distance each no less than 19 more such: these shook the house so violently, that they expected every moment it would fall upon their heads. The neighbours, on this, as has been said, being all alarmed, flocked to the house in great numbers, and all joined in prayer and psalm singing; during which the noise still continued in the other rooms, and the discharge of cannons was heard as from without, though no visible agent was seen to discharge them. But what was the most alarming of all, and put an end to their proceedings effectually, happened the next day as they were all at dinner, when a paper, in which they had signed a mutual agreement to reserve a part of the premises out of the general survey, and afterwards to share it equally amongst themselves, (which paper they had hid for the present under the earth in a pot in one corner of the room, and in which an orange-tree grew), was consumed in a wonderful manner, by the earth's taking fire with which the pot was filled, and burning violently with a blue fume, and an intolerable stench; so that they were all driven out of the house, to which they could never again be prevailed upon to return.\n\nThis wonderful contrivance was all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the memorable Joseph Collins of Oxford, otherwise called Funny Joe, who having hired himself as secretary, under the name of Giles Sharp, by knowing the private traps belonging to the house, and the help of pulvis fulminans and other chemical preparations, and letting his fellow-servants into the scheme, carried on the deceit without discovery to the very last; insomuch that the Dr Plot, in his Natural History, relates the whole for fact, and concludes in this grave manner, \"That though tricks have been often played in affairs of this kind, many of the things above related are not reconcileable by juggling; such as the loud noises, beyond the power of man to make without such instruments as were not there; the tearing and breaking the beds; the throwing about the fire; the hoof treading out the candle; and the striving for the sword, and the blow the man received from the pommel of it.\"\n\nSpectre of the Broken, a singular phenomenon observed on the top of the Broken, one of the Hartz <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> in Hanover, of which M. Haue has given the following account. \"After having been here (says he) for the thirtieth time, and having procured information respecting the above-mentioned atmospheric phenomenon, I was at length, on the 23rd of May 1797, fortunate as to have the pleasure of seeing it; and perhaps my description may afford satisfaction to others who visit the Broken through curiosity. The sun rose about four o'clock, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> being quite serene towards the east, his rays could pass without any obstruction over the Heinrichsh\u00f6he. In the south-west, how-\nAbout a quarter past four I went towards the inn, and looked round to see whether the atmosphere would permit me to have a free prospect to the south-west; when I observed, at a very great distance towards Achtermannsh\u00f6he, a human figure of a monstrous size. A violent gust of wind having almost carried away my hat, I clapped my hand to it by moving my arm towards my head, and the colossal figure did the same.\n\nThe pleasure which I felt on this discovery can hardly be described; for I had already walked many a weary step in the hopes of seeing this shadowy image, without being able to gratify my curiosity. I immediately made another movement by bending my body, and the colossal figure before me repeated it. I was desirous of doing the same thing once more\u2014but my colossus had vanished. I remained in the same position, waiting to see whether it would return; and in a few minutes it again made its appearance on the Achtermannsh\u00f6he. I paid my respects to it a second time, and it did the same to me. I then called the landlord of the Broken; and having both taken the same position which I had taken alone, we looked towards the Achtermannsh\u00f6he, but saw nothing. We had not, however, stood long, when two such colossal figures were formed over the above eminence, which repeated our compliments by bending their bodies as we did; after which they vanished. We retained our position; kept our eyes fixed on the same spot, and in a little the two figures again stood before us, and were joined by a third. Every movement that we made by bending our bodies these figures imitated\u2014but with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, that the phenomenon was sometimes weak and faint, sometimes strong and well defined. Having thus had an opportunity of discovering the whole secret of this phenomenon, I can give the following information to such of my readers as may be desirous of seeing it themselves. When the rising sun, and according to analogy the calf will be the same at the setting sun, throws his rays over the Broken upon the body of a man standing opposite to fine light clouds floating around or hovering past him, he needs only fix his eyes steadfastly upon them, and, in all probability, he will see the singular spectacle of his own shadow extending to the length of five or six hundred feet, at the distance of about two miles before him.\"\n\nSPECULARIS Lapis, composed of large plates of extreme thinness.

The process given by the late J. Edwards, who was rewarded by the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">Longitude</a>, for disclosing it to the public, was published in the Speculum Nautical Almanack for 1787, and is as follows: Melt the copper in a large crucible, employing some black flux, composed of two parts of tartar and one of nitre; when melted, add to it the brafs and the silver. Let the pure tin be melted in another crucible, also with some black flux. Take them both from the fire, and pour the melted tin into the fused mass in the large crucible. Stir the whole well with a dry spatula of birch, and pour off the fused metal immediately into a large quantity of cold water. The sudden chill of the water will cause the fluid metal to divide into an infinite number of small particles, which will cool instantly.\n\nIf the copper be completely saturated, the fracture of one piece of this mixed metal will appear bright, and of a gleamy look, resembling the face of pure quicksilver. But if it is of a brown reddish colour, it wants a little more tin. To ascertain the required <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, melt a small quantity, known by weights, of the mixed metal, with a known very small part of tin; and, if necessary, repeat the trial with different doses, till the fracture of the new mixture looks as already described. Having now ascertained the necessary addition of tin that is required, proceed to the last melting of the whole metal, together with the additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> dose of tin; fuse the whole, observing the same cautions as before; and you will find that the mixture will melt with a much less heat than that for the first fusion. Have ready as many ounces of white arsenic in coarse powder as there are pounds in the weight of the metal; wrap up the arsenic in a small paper, and put it, with a pair of tongs, into the crucible; stir it well with the spatula, retaining the breath to avoid the arsenical fumes or vapours (which however are not found to be hurtful to the lungs) till they disappear; take the crucible off the fire, clear away the dross from the top of the metal, pour in about one ounce of powdered rosin, with as much nitre, in order to give the metal a clean surface, and pour out the metal into the moulded flasks.\n\nThe speculum should be moulded with the concave surface downwards, and many small holes should be made through the sand upwards, to discharge the air. The moulding sand from Highgate near London, used by the founders, is as good as any for casting these metallic mirrors. The cast metal should be taken out from the sand of the flasks whilst it is hot, or else it may happen to crack if left to cool within. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">TELESCOPE</a>.\n\nBut in addition to what has now been said, we must notice some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> relative to the grinding, polishing, and other important circumstances connected with the method of preparing the most perfect speculum for telescopes. The metal being taken out of the flask, as already noticed, and this should be done as soon as it has become solid, and while it is yet red hot, care must be taken to keep the face downwards to prevent it from sinking. Holding it in that position by the git, force out the sand from the hole in the middle of the mirror with a piece of wood or iron, and place the speculum in an iron pot, with a large quantity of hot ashes or small coals, so as to bury the speculum in them a sufficient depth. If the sand is not forced out of the hole in the manner above directed, the metal, by sinking as it cools, will...\nwill embrace the sand in the middle of the speculum so tight, as to cause it to crack before it becomes entirely cold. And if the metal be not taken out of the sand, and put in a pot with hot ashes or coals to anneal it, the moisture from the sand will always break the metal. Let the speculum remain in the ashes till the whole is become quite cold. The git may be easily taken off by marking it round with a common fine half round file, and giving it then a gentle blow. The metal is then to be rough ground and figured.\n\nBut before we proceed to describe that process, it may be proper to give an account of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> for the speculum of a reflecting telescope, which has been employed with great success, by Rochon director of the marine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> at Brest. Of this composition the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ingredient is platinum; which, in grains, must be purified in a strong fire by means of nitre and the salt of glass, or that flux which in the English glass-houses is called by the workmen sandifer. To the platinum, when purified, add the eighth part of the metal employed in the composition of common specula; for tin without red copper would not produce a good effect. This mixture is then to be exposed to the most violent heat, which must be still excited by the oxygen gas that disengages itself from nitre when thrown into the fire. One melting would be insufficient; five or six are requisite to bring the mixture to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. It is necessary that the metal should be in a state of complete fusion at the moment when it is poured into the mould. By this process I have been enabled (says the author) to construct a telescope with platinum, which magnifies the diameters of objects five hundred times, with a degree of clearness and distinctness requisite for the nicest observations. The large speculum of platinum weighs fourteen pounds; it is eight inches in diameter, and its focus is five feet. Though the high price of platinum will, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, forever prevent it from coming into general use for the speculaums of telescopes, we thought it proper to notice this discovery, and shall now proceed to the grinding of the speculum.\n\nFor accomplishing this object, a very complicated process is recommended in Smith's Optics, and one not much more simple, by Mr Mudge in the 67th volume of the Philosophical Transactions; but according to Mr Edwards, whose speculaums are confessedly the best, neither of these is necessary. Besides a common grindstone, all the tools that he made use of are a rough grinder, which serves also as a polisher, and a bed of stones. When the speculum was cold, he ground its surface bright on a common grindstone, previously brought to the form of the gage; and then took it to the rough grinder.\n\nThe tool is composed of a mixture of lead and tin, or of pewter, and is made of an elliptical form, of such dimensions, that the shortest diameter of the ellipse is equal to the diameter of the mirror or speculum, and the longest diameter is to the shortest in the proportion of ten to nine. This rough grinder may be fixed upon a block of wood, in order to raise it higher from the bench; and as the metal is ground upon it with fine emery, Mr Mudge, with whom, in this particular, Mr Edwards agrees, directs a hole or pit to be made in the middle of it as a lodgement for the emery, and deep grooves to be cut out across its surface with a graver for the same purpose. By means of a handle, fixed on the back of the metal with soft cement, the speculum can be whirled round upon this grinder so rapidly, that a common labourer has been known to give a piece of metal, four inches in diameter, to good a face and figure as to fit it for the holes in the space of two hours. The emery, however fine, will break up the metal very much; but that is remedied by the subsequent processes of honing and polishing.\n\nWhen the metal is brought to a true figure, it must be taken to a convex tool, formed of some stones from a place called Edgedon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>, situated between Ludlow and Bishop's Castle. The common blue stones, used by many opticians for this purpose, will scarcely touch the metal of Mr Edwards's speculaums; but where they must be employed for want of the others, as little water should be used as possible when the metal is put upon them; because it is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that they cut better when but barely wet, than when drenched with water. The stones, however, from Edgedon are greatly preferable; for they cut the metal more easily, and having a very fine grain, they bring it to a smooth face. These stones are directed by Mr Mudge to be cemented in small pieces upon a thick round piece of marble, or of metal made of tin and lead like the former composition, in such a manner, that the lines between the stones may run straight from one side to the other; so that placing the teeth of a very fine saw in each of these divisions, they may be cleared from one end to the other of the cement which rises between the stones. As soon as the stones are cemented down, this tool must be fixed in the lathe, and turned as exactly true to the gage as possible. It should be of a circular figure, and but very little larger than the metal intended to be figured upon it. If it be made considerably larger, it will grind the metal into a larger sphere and a bad figure; and if it be made exactly of the same size, it will work the metal indeed into a figure truly spherical, but will be apt to shorten its focus, unless the metal and tool be worked alternately upwards. On these accounts, Mr Edwards recommends it to be made about one twentieth part longer in diameter than the speculum, because he has found that it does not then alter its focus; and he earnestly dissuades the use of much water on the hone pavement at the time of using it; otherwise, he says, that the metal in different parts of it will be of different degrees of brightness.\n\nThe metal being brought to a very fine face and figure by the bed of stones, is ready to receive a polish, which is given to it by the elliptical rough grinder covered with pitch. With respect to the consistency of this pitch, Mr Mudge and Mr Edwards give very different directions. Whilst the former says that it should be neither too hard nor too soft, the latter affirms that the harder the pitch is, the better figure it will give to the metal. Pitch may be easily made of a sufficient hardness by adding a proper quantity of rosin; and when it is hardened in this way, it is not so brittle as pitch alone, which is hardened by boiling. Mr Edwards advises to make the mixture just so hard as to receive, when cold, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> from a moderate pressure of the nail of one's finger. When the elliptical tool is to be covered with this mixture, it must be made pretty warm, and in that state have the mixture poured upon it when beginning to cool in the crucible. Our author\nSpeculum. author recommends this coating to be made everywhere of about the thickness of half a crown; and to give it the proper form, it must, when somewhat cool, be pressed upon the face of the mirror, which has first been dipped in cold water, or covered over with very fine writing paper. If it be not found to have taken the exact figure from the first pressure, the surface of the pitch must be gently warmed, and the operation repeated as before. All the superfluous pitch is now to be taken away from the edge of the polisher with a pen knife, and a hole to be made in the middle, accurately round, with a conical piece of wood. This hole should go quite through the tool, and should be made of the same size, or somewhat less than the hole in the middle of the speculum. Mr Edwards says, that he has always found that small mirrors, though without any hole in the middle, polish much better, and take a more correct figure, for the polisher's having a hole in the middle of it.\n\nThe polisher being thus formed, it must be very gently warmed at the fire, and divided into several squares by the edge of a knife. These, by receiving the small portion of metal that works off in polishing, will cause the figure of the speculum to be more correct than if no such squares had been made. Mr Mudge directs the polisher to be strewed over with very fine patty; but Mr Edwards prefers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCOTHAR\">Colcothar</a> of vitriol. Patty (says he) gives to metals a white lustre, or, as workmen call it, a silver hue; but good colcothar of vitriol will polish with a very fine and high black lustre, so as to give the metal finished with it the complection of polished steel. To know if the colcothar of vitriol is good, put some of it into your mouth, and if you find it dissolves away it is good; but if you find it hard, and crunch between your teeth, then it is bad, and not well burned. Good colcothar of vitriol is of a deep red, or of a deep purple colour, and is soft and oily when rubbed between the fingers; bad colcothar of vitriol is of a light red colour, and feels harsh and gritty. The colcothar of vitriol should be levigated between two surfaces of polished steel, and wrought with a little water; when it is worked dry, you may add a little more water, to carry it lower down to what degree you please. When the colcothar of vitriol has been wrought dry three or four times, it will acquire a black colour, and will be low enough, or sufficiently fine, to give an exquisite lustre. This levigated colcothar of vitriol must be put into a small phial, and kept with some water upon it. When it is to be used, every part of the pitch-polisher must be first brushed over with a fine camel's hair brush, which has been dipped in pure water, and rubbed gently over a piece of dry clean soap. The washed colcothar of vitriol is then to be put upon the polisher; and Mr Edwards directs a large quantity of it to be put on at once, so as to saturate the pitch, and form a fine coating. If a second or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this powder be found necessary, it must be used very sparingly, or the polish will be destroyed which has been already attained. When the metal is nearly polished, there will always appear some black mud upon its surface, as well as upon the tool. Part of this must be wiped away with some very soft wash leather; but if the whole of it be taken away, the polishing will not be so well completed.\n\nWith respect to the parabolic figure to be given to Vol. XIX.

His History of Stephen Duck was first published in 1731; but it was afterwards much altered, and prefixed to an edition of Duck's poems.\n\nAbout this time he travelled into Italy as tutor to the earl of Lincoln, afterwards duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>.\u2014In 1736 he republished Gorboduc, at Mr Pope's desire, with a preface giving an account of the author, the earl of Dorset. He quitted his fellowship in 1742, upon being presented by the Society of New College to the rectory of Great Harwood in Buckinghamshire.\u2014He never refused in his living; but paid it an annual visit, distributing large sums of money among the poor, and providing for many of their children. The same year he was made professor of modern history at Oxford. In 1747 he published Polyetess; or an inquiry concerning the agreement between the works of the Roman poets and the remains of ancient artists, being an attempt to illustrate them mutually from each other. This work was treated by Gray with a contempt which it did not deserve. He raises objections because the author did not illustrate his subject from Greek writers; that is, because he failed to execute what he never undertook. He was installed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREBENDARY\">prebendary</a> of the seventh stall at Durham the 24th May 1754. He published the same year, \"An Account of the Life, Character, and Poems, of Mr Blacklock, student of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>;\" which was afterwards prefixed to his Poems. The prose pieces which he printed in the Museum he collected and published, together with some others, in a pamphlet called Moralities, by Sir Harry Beaumont. Under the same name he published \"Crito, or a Dialogue on Beauty;\" and \"A particular Account of the emperor of China's Gardens near Pekin, in a letter from F. Attiret, a French missionary now employed by that emperor to paint the apartments in those gardens, to his friend at Paris.\" Both these treatises are printed in Dodley's fugitive pieces, as is also \"A Letter from a Swiss Officer to his friend at Rome;\" which Mr Spence first published in the Museum. In 1758 he published \"A Parallel, in the Manner of Plutarch, between a most celebrated man of Florence and one scarce ever heard of in England.\" This was also inserted in the fugitive pieces. The same year he made a journey into Scotland, which he described in an affectionate letter to Mr Shenstone, published in Hall's Collection of Letters, 1758. In 1764 he was very well described by Mr James Ridley, in his admirable Tales of the Genii, under the name of Phelos Ecneps (his name read backwards), derivate of the groves. A letter from Mr Spence to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> moralist, under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a>, is preserved in the 3d volume of \"Letters...\"\nIn 1768 he published \"Remarks and Dissertations on Virgil, with some other classical observations, by the late Mr Holdsworth.\" On the 29th of August the same year he was unfortunately drowned in a canal in his garden at Byfleet in Surrey. He was found flat upon his face at the edge of the canal, where the water was so shallow as not even to cover his head. The accident, it was supposed, for he was quite alone, was owing to a fit.\n\nThe duke of Newcastle possessed some manuscript volumes of anecdotes collected by Mr Spence, from which Dr Johnson was permitted to insert many extracts in his Lives of the Poets.","sp":196,"ep":197},{"h":"SPENCER","t":"Dr John, an eminent divine, was born in Kent in 1630, and educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>.

All we know concerning his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> is, that he was admitted a fellow of Pembroke-hall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and matriculated in 1569. At this time began his intimacy with Mr Gabriel Harvey, a man of genius and a poet. In 1576, having completed his degrees in arts, he left the university, as it is conjectured, for want of subsistence, and retired to the north of England. Here he had the misfortune to become enamoured of his Rosalind, who, after flattering his passion for a time, at length preferred his happier rival. Spenser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the country till the year 1578, when at the persuasion of his friend Mr Harvey he removed to London, where that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> introduced him to Mr Sidney (afterwards Sir Philip Sidney). Concerning his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to Sir Philip, there is indeed a different story, which was first told by the writer of his life, prefixed to his works in 1679, and transcribed by Hughes, Cibber, and several others; which, nevertheless, is certainly not true. The purport of it is, that Spenser, being unknown to this Mecenas of the age, went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>-house, and sent in the 9th canto of the first book of the Fairy Queen; that, on reading part of it, Sir Philip ordered his steward to give the bearer 50l.; on reading a little farther 50l. more; then 200l. bidding him to make haste and pay the money, lest he should give the poet his whole estate. The story tells prettily enough; but it is very certain, that the Fairy Queen was begun long after his acquaintance with Sir Philip. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> patron of genius, however, he was presented to Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, who honoured him with the place of poet-laureat. About this time he finished his Shepherd's Calendar, which was first printed in 1579; and in the following year, being recommended by his patron to the earl of Leicester, he went to Ireland as secretary to the lord Grey of Wilton, then appointed lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of that kingdom. Lord Grey was recalled in 1582, and with him Spenser returned to London, where he continued till after the death of Sir Philip Sidney in 1586; a loss which he bewailed to the end of his life. The following year, our poet, having obtained a royal grant of 3000 acres of forfeited lands in the county of Cork in Ireland, set out for that kingdom, took possession of his estate, and fixed his residence in the castle of Kilcolman, which had belonged to the earl of Desmond. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> he resumed his great work of the Fairy Queen; and continued in Ireland till, being visited by his old friend Sir Walter Raleigh in 1589, he came over with him to England, but returned to Ireland the year following, where he fell in love with a country girl, and married her. Soon after his marriage, he paid another visit to his native country, where we also find him in 1596. In the following year he returned once more to Kilcolman; but on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> of Lord Tyrone, who ravaged the whole county of Cork, he was obliged to fly for safety with his family to England, where, in the year 1599, he died in extreme poverty (A). He was buried in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> Abbey, according to his request, near Chaucer. A monument was erected to his memory by Ann countess of Dorset. We know but little of his character as a man; as a poet, considering the age in which he lived, he deserves our utmost veneration. He wrote various pieces besides those above mentioned. His whole works, with his life by Hughes, were published in six volumes 12mo, in 1715 and 1750.","sp":197,"ep":197},{"h":"SPERGULA","t":"SURREY, a genus of plants belonging to the class of decandra; and in the natural system arranged\n\n(A) This is Camden's account, and it has been generally believed; but Mr Malone, the last editor of Shakespeare's works, by examining the patent roll, 33 Eliz. p. 3, has discovered, that in February 1600-1 Spenser obtained from Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> an annuity or pension of 50l. during his life; a sum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 200l. at present.\nSperm, arranged under the 22d order, Caryophyllaceae.

Others say, that after being pressed and drained they are more thoroughly purified by steeping them in a ley of alkaline salt and quicklime. The brains are then washed, and cut into thin flakes or slices with woollen knives. One filth is said to afford some tons of brains. Good spermaceti is glossy and semitransparent, in fine white flakes; soft and unctuous to the touch, yet dry and friable; in taste, somewhat like butter, and of a faint smell like that of tallow. Some adulterate it with wax; but the deceit is discovered, either by the smell of the wax or by the dulness of the colour. Some also sell a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of oil taken from the tail of the whale instead of that from the brain; but this kind turns yellow as soon as exposed to the air. Indeed it is apt in general to grow yellowish, and to contract a rancid fishy smell if not carefully secured from the air. The more perfectly it has been purified at first, the less susceptible it is of these alterations; and after it has been changed, it may be rendered white and sweet again by steeping it afresh in a ley of alkaline salt and quicklime. It melts in a small degree of heat, and congeals again as it cools.\n\nSpermaceti is of use in medicine. Quincy says it is a noble remedy in the asthma, &c., though chiefly used in bruises, inward hurts, and after delivery. For internal use, it may be dissolved in aqueous liquors into the form of an emulsion, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRITURATION\">trituration</a> with almonds, the yolk or white of an egg, and more elegantly by macerations; or made into a lochock, by mixing two drams of it with a suitable quantity of yolk of egg, then adding half an ounce of fresh drawn oil of almonds, and an ounce of balmatic syrup. Spermaceti is not capable of being dissolved by caustic alkalies, and of forming soaps, like other oily matters; but it is altogether soluble in oils, and unites by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIQUEFACTION\">liquefaction</a> with wax and resins; and in these forms is applied externally. But it is certain, its greatest property, and that which makes it so much in vogue in many places, is its softening the skin. Whence it comes to be used by the ladies in pastes, washes, &c.\n\nSpermaceti candles are of modern manufacture: they are made smooth, with a fine glost, free from rings and scars, superior to the finest wax candles in colour and lustre; and, when genuine, leave no spot or stain on the finest silk, cloth, or linen.\n\nA method has been lately proposed by Dr Smith Gibbes of Bristol, to convert animal muffle into a substance much resembling spermaceti. The process is remarkably simple: Nothing more is necessary than to take a dead carcase and expose it to a stream of running water: it will in a short time be changed to a mass of fatty matter. To remove the offensive smell, a quantity of nitrous acid may then be poured upon it, which uniting with the fetid matter, the fat is separated in a pure state. This acid indeed turns it yellow, but it may be rendered white and pure by the action of the oxygenated muriatic acid. Mr Gibbes brought about the same change in a much shorter time. He took three lean pieces of mutton and poured on them the three mineral acids, and he perceived that at the end of three days each was much altered; that in the nitrous acid was much softened, and on separating the acid from it, he found it to be exactly the same with that which he had before got from the water; that in the muriatic acid was not in that time so much altered; the vitriolic acid had turned the other black.","sp":198,"ep":198},{"h":"SPERMACOCE","t":"Burton-wood, a genus of plants belonging to the class of tetrandria; and in the natural system arranged under the 47th order, Belliaceae.

It sprang from the union of Orthos with the Chim\u00e6ra, or of Typhon with Echidna. The Sphinx had been sent into the neighbourhood of Thebes by Juno, who wished to punish the family of Cadmus, which she persecuted with immortal hatred, and it laid this part of Boeotia under continual alarms, by proposing enigmas, and devouring the inhabitants if unable to explain them. In the midst of their consternation the Thebans were told by the oracle, that the sphinx would destroy herself as soon as one of the enigmas she proposed was explained. In this enigma she wished to know what animal walked on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening. Upon this Creon king of Thebes promised his crown and his sister Jocasta in marriage to him who could deliver his country from the monster by a successful explanation of the enigma. It was at last happily explained by Oedipus, who observed, that man walked on his hands and feet when young, or in the morning of life; at the noon of life he walked erect; and in the evening of his days he supported his infirmities upon a stick. (Vol. Oedipus). The sphinx no sooner heard this explanation than she dashed her head against a rock, and immediately expired. Some mythologists wish to unriddle the fabulous traditions about the sphinx by the supposition that one of the daughters of Cadmus, or Laius, infected the country of Thebes by her continual depredations, because she had been refused a part of her father's possessions. The lion's paw expressed, as they observe, her cruelty, the body of the dog her lasciviousness, her enigmas the snare she laid for strangers and travellers, and her wings the dispatch she used in her expeditions.\n\nAmong the Egyptians the sphinx was the symbol of religion, by reason of the obscurity of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a>; and on the same account the Romans placed a sphinx in the pronaos or porch of their temples. Sphinxes were used by the Egyptians to show the beginning of the water's rising in the Nile: with this view, as it had the head of a woman and body of a lion, it signified that the Nile began to swell in the months of July and August, when the sun passes through the signs of Leo and Virgo. There are several of these still to be seen; one in particular, near the pyramids, much spoken of by the ancients; being of a prodigious size, and cut out of the rock; the head and neck appear only at present, the rest of the body being hid in the sand. This, according to Thevenot, is 26 feet high, and 15 feet from the ear to the chin: but Pliny affirms us, the head was no less than 102 feet in circumference, and 62 feet high from the belly, and that the body was 143 feet long, and was thought to be the sepulchre of King Amasis.\n\nThe learned Mr Bryant * observes, that the sphinx Ancient seems to have been originally a vast rock of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol12.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">Mythology</a>, frata; which, from a shapeless mass, the Egyptians fashioned into an object of beauty and veneration. The Egyptians used this figure in their building; from them the Greeks derived it, and afterwards improved it into an elegant ornament. It is also frequently used in modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>.\n\nIt is proper to observe, that the sphinx of the Egyptians is said in the Asiatic Researches \u2020 to have been found in India.

But in opposition to this account given by Murari Pandit, the late Sir William Jones, the learned and illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Asiatic Society, was assured by several Brahmins, that the figure taken for a sphinx was a representation of a lion seizing a young elephant.

The keys are so many flat pieces of wood, which, touched and pressed down at the end, make the other raise a jack which strikes and sounds the strings by means of the end of a crow's quill, wherewith it is armed. The first strings are of braids, the other more delicate ones of steel or iron-wire; they are all stretched over the two bridges already mentioned. The figure of the spinet is a long square or parallelogram; some call it a harp couched, and the harp an inverted spinet. See the article Harp.\n\nThis instrument is generally tuned by the ear, which method of the practical musicians is founded on a supposition that the ear is a perfect judge of an octave and a fifth. The general rule is to begin at a certain note, as C, taken towards the middle of the instrument, and tuning all the octaves up and down, and also the fifths, reckoning seven semitones to each fifth, by which means the whole is tuned. Sometimes to the common or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> play of the spinet is added another similar one in unison, and a third in octave to the first, to make the harmony the fuller; they are either played separately or together by means of a flop: these are called double or triple spinets; sometimes a play of violins is added, by means of a bow, or a few wheels parallel to the keys, which press the strings and make the sound last as long as the musician pleases, and heighten and soften them more or less, as they are more or less pressed. The harpsichord is a kind of spinet, only with another disposition of the keys (see the article Harpsichord). The instrument takes its name from the small quill ends which touch the strings, resembling spine or thorns.","sp":200,"ep":200},{"h":"SPINI-FEX","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the class of polygama.

Spinning is either performed on the wheel, or with a distaff and spindle, or with other machines proper for the several kinds of working. Hemp, flax, nettle-thread, and other like vegetable matters, are to be wetted in spinning: silks, wools, &c., are spun dry, and do not need water; yet there is a way of spinning or reeling silk as it comes off the cafes or balls, where hot and even boiling water is to be used (see Silk). The vast variety, and the importance of those branches of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, which are produced from cotton, wool, and flax, spun into yarn, together with the cheapness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and the low price of labour in many foreign countries, which are our rivals in trade, have occasioned many attempts at home to render spinning more easy, cheap, and expeditious; for which see Cotton-Spinning and Cotton Mills.\n\nTo give an intelligible and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of a cotton mill would be abundant employment for a volume. Our limits admit of nothing like this; but as we are certain that many of our readers have viewed a cotton mill with wonder, but not with intelligence, or with leisure to trace the steps by which the wool from the bag ultimately assumes the form of a very fine thread. Bewildered by such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of machinery, all in rapid motion, very few, we imagine, are able to recollect with difficulties and intelligence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part of the process by which the form of the cotton is so wonderfully changed. Such readers will not think a page or two misemployed, if they are thereby able to understand this particular, to which all the rest of the process is subservient.\n\nWe pass over the operation of carding, by which all\nthe clots and inequalities of the cotton wool are removed, and the whole is reduced to an uniform thin fleece, about 20 inches broad. This is gradually detached from the finishing card, and, if allowed to hang down from it, would pile up on the floor as long as the mill continues to work; but it is guided off from the card, very tenderly, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, by laying its detached end over a roller, which is slowly turned round by the machine. Another roller lies above the fleece, preluding it down by its weight. By this pressure, a gentle hold is taken of the fleece, and therefore the slow motion of the rollers draws it gently from the card at the same rate as it is disengaged by the comb; but between the card and the rollers a set of smooth pins are placed in two rows, leading from the card to the rollers, and gradually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> each other as we approach the rollers. By these pins the broad fleece is hemmed in on both sides, and gradually contracted to a thick roll; and in this state passes between the rollers, and is compressed into a pretty firm flat ribbon, about two inches broad, which falls off from the rollers, and piles up in deep tinplate cans set below to receive it.\n\nIt is upon this stripe or ribbon of cotton wool that the operation of spinning begins. The general effect of the spinning process is to draw out this massive roll, and to twist it as it is drawn out. But this is not to be done by the fingers, pulling out as many cotton fibres at once as are necessary for composing a thread of the intended fineness, and continuing this manipulation regularly across the whole end of the ribbon, and thus, as it were, nibbling the whole of it away. The fingers must be directed, for this purpose, by an attentive eye. But in performing this by machinery, the whole ribbon must be drawn out together, and twisted as it is drawn. This requires great art, and very delicate management. It cannot be done at once; that is, the cotton roll cannot first be stretched or drawn out to the length that is ultimately produced from a tenth of an inch of the roll, and then be twisted. There is not cohesion enough for this purpose; we should only break off a bit of the roll, and could make no farther use of it. The fibres of cotton are very little implicated among each other in the roll, because the operation of carding has laid them almost parallel in the roll; and though compressed a little by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> from a fleece of 20 inches to a ribbon of only two, and afterwards compressed between the discharging rollers of the carding machine, yet they cohere so slightly, that a few fibres may be drawn out without bringing many others along with them. For these reasons, the whole thickness and breadth of two or three inches of the ribbon is stretched to a very minute quantity, and then a very slight degree of twist is given it, viz. about three turns in the inch; so that it shall now compose an extremely soft and spungy cylinder, which cannot be called a thread or cord, because it has scarcely any firmness, and is merely rounder and much flonder than before, being stretched to about thrice its former length. It is now called flab, or roove.\n\nAlthough it be still extremely tender, and will not carry a weight of two ounces, it is much more cohesive than before, because the twist given to it makes all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> fibres bind each other together, and compress those which lie athwart; therefore it will require more force to pull a fibre from among the rest, but still not nearly enough to break it. In drawing out a single fibre, others are drawn out along with it; and if we take hold of the whole assemblage, in two places, about an inch or two inches asunder, we shall find that we may draw it to near twice its length without any rift of its separating in any intermediate part, or becoming much smaller in one part than another. It seems to yield equally over all.\n\nSuch is the state of the flab or roove of the first formation. It is usually called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>; and the operation of spinning is considered as not yet begun. This preparation is the most tedious, and requires more attendance and hand labour than any subsequent part of the process. For the stripes or ribands from which it is made are so light and bulky, that a few yards only can be piled up in the cans set to receive them. A person must therefore attend each thread of flab, to join fresh stripes as they are expended. It is also the most important in the manufacture: for as every inch of the flab meets with precisely the same drawing and the same twisting in the subsequent parts of the process, therefore every inequality and fault in the flab (indeed in the fleece as it quits the finishing card) will continue through the whole manufacture. The spinning of cotton yarn now divides into two branches. The first, performed by what are called jenniers, perfectly resembles the ancient spinning with the distaff and spindle; the other, called spinning of twirls, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the spinning with the fly-wheel. They differ in the same manner as the spinning with the old wool or cotton wheel differs from the spinning with the flax-wheel. Mr Arkwright's chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, the substitution of machinery for the immediate work of the human finger, is seen only in the manufacture of twist. We shall therefore confine our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to this.\n\nThe rest of the process is little more than a repetition of that gone through in making the first flab or roove. It is formed on bobbins. These are set on the back part of the drawing frame; and the end of the flab is brought forwards toward the attending workman. As it comes forward, it is stretched or drawn to about four-thirds of its former length, or lengthened one-third; and is then twisted about twice as much as before, and in this state wound up on another bobbin. In some mills two rooves, after having been properly drawn, are brought together through one hole, and twisted into one; but we believe that, in the greater number of mills, this is deferred to the second drawing. It is only after the first drawing that the produce of the operation gets the name of flab; before this it is called preparation, or roove, or by some other name. The flab is still a very feeble, soft, and delicate yarn, and will not carry much more weight than it did before in the form of roove. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of the ultimate thread or yarn depends on this extreme softness; for it is this only which makes it susceptible of an equable stretching; all the fibres yielding and separating alike.\n\nThe next operation is the second drawing, which however differs from the first, except in the different proportionings of the lengthening, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> between the lengthening and the subsequent twist. On these points we cannot give any very distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. It is different in different mills, and with different species of cotton wool, as may be easily imagined. The immediate mechanism or manipulation must be skilfully accommodated to the nature of that friction which\nSpinning, which the fibres of cotton exert on each other, enabling one of them to pull others along with it. This is greatly aided by the contorted curled form of a cotton fibre, and a considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> which it possesses. In this respect it greatly resembles woollen fibres, and differs exceedingly from those of flax; and it is, for this reason that it is scarcely possible to spin flax in this way: its fibres become lank, and take any shape by the slightest compression, especially when damp in the slightest degree. But besides this, the surface of a cotton fibre has a harshness or roughness, which greatly augments their mutual friction. This is probably the reason why it is so unfit for tents and other dressings for wounds, and is refused by the surgeon even in the meanest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>. But this harshness and its elasticity fit it admirably for the manufacture of yarn. Even the shortness of the fibre is favourable; and the manufacture would hardly be possible if the fibre were twice as long as it generally is. If it be just so long that in the finished thread a fibre will rather break than come out from among the rest, it is plain that no additional length can make the yarn any stronger with the same degree of compression by twining. A longer fibre will indeed give the same firmness of adherence with a smaller compression. This would be an advantage in any other yarn; but in cotton yarn the compression is already as slight as can be allowed; were it less, it would become woolly and rough by the smallest usage, and is already too much disposed to teaze out. It can hardly be used as sewing thread. Now suppose the fibres much longer; some of them may chance to be stretched along the slab through their whole length. If the slab is pulled in opposite directions, by pinching it at each end of such fibres, it is plain that it will not stretch till this fibre be broken or drawn out; and that while it is in its extended state, it is acting on the other fibres in a very unequal manner, according to their positions, and renders the whole apt to separate more irregularly. This is one great obstacle to the spinning of flax by similar machinery; and it has hitherto prevented (we believe) the working up of anything but the shortest or tow, which is separated from the long fine flax in the operation of hatcheling.\n\nA third, and sometimes even a fourth, drawing is given to the slab formed on the bobbins of this second operation. The slab produced is now a slender, but still extremely soft cord, susceptible of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, without risk of separation, and without the smallest chance of breaking a single fibre in the attempt. In one or more of the preparatory drawings now described, two, and sometimes three slabs, of a former drawing, are united before the twist is given them. The practice is different in different mills. It is plain, that unless great care be taken to preserve the slab extremely soft and compressible during the whole process, the subsequent drawing becomes more precarious, and we run a risk of at last making a bad loose thread instead of a uniform and simple yarn. Such a thread will have very little lateral connection, and will not bear much handling without separating into strands. The perfection of the yarn depends on having the last slab as free of all appearance of strands as possible.\n\nThe last operation is the spinning this slab. This hardly differs from the foregoing drawings in anything but the twist that is given it, after the last stretching in its length. This is much greater than any of the preceding, being intended to give the yarn hardness and firmness, so that it will now break rather than stretch any more.\n\nThe reader, moderately acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, cannot but perceive that each of the operations now described, by which the rove is changed into the soft slab, and each of these into one flenderer and somewhat firmer, by alternately teasing out and twining the soft cord, is a substitute for a single pull of the finger and thumb of the spinner, which the accommodates precisely to the peculiar condition of the lock of wool which he touches at the moment. She can follow this through all its irregularities; and perhaps no two succeeding plucks are alike. But when we cannot give this momentary attention to every minute portion, we must be careful to introduce the rove in a state of perfect uniformity; and then every inch being treated in the same manner, the final result will be equable\u2014the yarn will be uniform.\n\nWe are now to describe the mechanism by which all this is effected. But we do not mean to describe a cotton mill; we only mean to describe what comes into immediate contact with the thread; and in so doing, to confine ourselves to what is necessary for making the reader perceive its ability to perform the required task. We see many cases where individuals can apply this knowledge to useful purposes. More than this would, we think, be improper, in a national point of view.\n\nLet ABC represent the section of a roller, whose pivot D does not turn in a pivot hole, but in the bottom of a long narrow notch DE, cut in an iron standard, abc is the section of another iron roller, whose pivot d is in the same notches at each end, while the roller itself lies or rests on the roller ABC below it. The surfaces of these rollers are fluted lengthwise like a column; only the flutings are very small and sharp, like deep strokes of engraving very close together. It is plain, that if the roller ABC be made to turn slowly round its axis by machinery, in the direction ABC (as expressed by the dart), the roughness of the flutings will take hold of the similar roughness of the upper roller abc, and carry it round also in the direction of the dart, while its pivots are engaged in the notches DE, which they cannot quit. If therefore we introduce the end F of the cotton string or ribbon, formed by the carding machine, it will be pulled in by this motion, and will be delivered out on the other side at H, considerably compressed by the weight of the upper roller, which is of iron, and is also pulled down by a lever which rests on its pivots, or other proper places, and is loaded with a weight. There is nothing to hinder this motion of the ribbon thus compressed between the rollers, and it will therefore be drawn through from the cans. The compressed part at H would hang down, and be piled up on the floor as it is drawn through; but it is not permitted to hang down in this manner, but is brought to another pair of sharp fluted iron rollers K and L. Supposing this pair of rollers to be of the same diameter, and to turn round in the same time, and in the same direction, with the rollers ABC, abc; it is plain that K and L drag in the compressed ribbon at I, and would deliver it on the other side at M, still more compressed. But the roller K is made (by the wheelwork) to turn round more swiftly than\nSpinning than ABC. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of velocity at the surface of the rollers is, however, very small, seldom exceeding one part in 12 or 15. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this difference is, that the skein of cotton HI will be lengthened in the same proportion; for the upper rollers pressing on the under ones with a considerable force, their sharp flutings take good hold of the cotton between them; and since K and L take up the cotton faster than ABC and abc deliver it out, it must either be forcibly pulled through between the first rollers, or it must be stretched a little by the fibres slipping among each other, or it must break. When the extension is so very moderate as we have just now said, the only effect of it is merely to begin to draw the fibres (which at present are lying in every possible direction) into a more favourable position for the subsequent extensions.\n\nThe fibres being thus drawn together into a more favourable position, the cotton is introduced between a third pair of rollers O, P, constructed in the same way, but to moved by the wheelwork that the surface of O moves nearly or fully twice as fast as the surface of K. The roller P being also well loaded, they take a firm hold of the cotton, and the part between K and O is nearly or fully doubled in its length, and now requires a little twining to make it roundish, and to consolidate it a little.\n\nIt is therefore led flopping downwards into a hole or eye in the upper pivot of the first fly, called a jack. This turns around an upright axis or spindle; the lower end of which has a pulley on it to give it motion by means of a band or belt, which passes round a drum that is turned by the machinery. This jack is of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and complicated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>. It is a substitute for the fly of the common spinning wheel. If made precisely in the form of that fly, the thread, being so very bulky and spongy, and unable to bear close packing on the bobbin, would swing out by the whirling of the fly, and would never coil up. The bobbin therefore is made to lie horizontally; and this occasions the complication, by the difficulty of giving it a motion round a horizontal axis, in order to coil up the twisted rove. Mr Arkwright has accomplished this in a very ingenious manner, the essential circumstances of which we shall here briefly describe. A is a roller of hard wood, having its surface cut into sharp flutes longitudinally. On the axis, which projects through the side of the general frame, there is a pulley P, connected by a band with another pulley Q, turning with the horizontal axis QR. This axis is made to turn by a contrivance which is different in every different cotton mill. The simplest of all is to place above the pulley C (which is turned by the great band of the machinery, and thus gives motion to the jack), a thin circular disc D, loose upon the axis, so as to turn round on it without obstruction. If this disc exceed the pulley in breadth about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)-th of an inch, the broad belt which turns the pulley will also turn it; but as its diameter is greater than that of the pulley, it will turn somewhat slower, and will therefore have a relative motion with respect to the axis QR. This can be employed, in order to give that axis a very slow motion, such as one turn of it for 20 or 30 of the jack. This we leave to the ingenuity of the reader. The bobbin B, on which the rove is to be coiled up, lies on this roller, its pivots passing through upright slits in the sides of the general frame. It lies on A, and is moved round by it, in the spinning-frame manner as the uppermost of a pair of drawing rollers lies on the under one, and receives motion from it. It is evident that the fluted surface of A, by turning slowly round, and carrying the weight of the bobbin, compresses a little the cotton that is between them; and its flutings, being sharp, take a slight hold of it, and cause it to turn round also, and thus coil up the rove, pulling it in through the hole E in the upper pivot (which resembles the fore pivot or eye of a spinning wheel fly) in so gentle a manner as to yield whenever the motion of the bobbin is too great for the speed with which the cotton skein is discharged by the rollers O and P.\u2014N. B. The axis QR below, also gives motion to a guide within the jack, which leads the rove gradually from one end of the bobbin to the other, and back again, so as to coil it with regularity till the bobbin is full. The whole of this internal mechanism of the jack is commonly shut up in a tin cylinder. This is particularly necessary when the whirling motion must be rapid, as in the second and third drawings. If open, the jacks would meet with much resistance from the air, which would load the mill with a great deal of useless work.\n\nThe reader is desired now to return to the beginning of the process, and to consider it attentively in its different stages. We apprehend that the description is sufficiently perspicuous to make him perceive the efficacy of the mechanism to execute all that is wanted, and prepare a flax that is uniform, soft, and still very extensible; in short, fit for undergoing the last treatment, by which it is made a fine and firm yarn.\n\nAs this part of the process differs from each of the former, merely by the degree of twist that is given to the yarn, and as this is given by means of a fly, not materially different from that of the spinning wheel for flax, we do not think it at all necessary to say anything more about it.\n\nThe intelligent reader is surely sensible that the yarn produced in this way must be exceedingly uniform. The uniformity really produced even exceeds all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>; for even although there be some small inequalities in the carded fleece, yet if these are not matted clots, which the card could not equalise, and only consist of a little more thickness of cotton in some places than in others, when such a piece of the stripe comes to the first roller, it will be rather more stretched by the second, and again by the bobbin, after the first very slight twining. That this may be done with greater certainty, the weights of the first roving rollers are made very small, so that the middle part of the skein can be drawn through, while the outer parts remain fast held.\n\nIt is said that a pound of the finest Bourbon cotton has been spun into a yarn extending a few yards beyond 119 miles!\n\nThese contrivances have in some parts of Scotland been applied to the spinning of flax.\n\n**Spinning Wheel.** A very considerable improvement has been made by Mr Antis of Fulneck near Leeds of the common spinning wheel. It is well known, that of Arts hitherto much time has been lost by stopping the wheel in order to shift the thread from one staple on the flyer to another; but in Mr Antis's wheel the bobbin is made to move backwards and forwards, so as to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of this perpetual interruption, as well as to ob...\nviate the danger of breaking the thread and losing the end. This is effected by the axis of the great wheel being extended through the pillar next the spinner, and formed into a pinion of one leaf A, which takes into a CCCCXCIX wheel B, seven inches diameter, having on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> 97 teeth; so that 97 revolutions of the great wheel cause one of the lesser wheel. On this lesser wheel is fixed a ring of wire c c c, which, being supported on six legs, stands obliquely to the wheel itself, touching it at one part, and projecting nearly three quarters of an inch at the opposite one: near the tide of this wheel is an upright lever C, about 15 inches long, moving on a centre, three inches from its lower extremity, and connected at the top to a sliding bar D; from which rises an upright piece of brass E, which working in the notch of a pulley drives the bobin F backward and forward, according as the oblique wire forces a pin G in or out, as the wheel moves round. To regulate and assist the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> motion, a weight H hangs by a line to the sliding bar, and pulling over a pulley I rises and falls as the bobin advances or recedes, and tends constantly to keep the pin in contact with the wire. It is evident, from this description, that one staple only is wanted to the flyer; which, being placed near the extremity K, the thread passing through it is by the motion of the bobin laid regularly thereon. For this invention the Society instituted at London for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. gave the author a premium of twenty guineas.","sp":200,"ep":204},{"h":"SPINOSUS CAULIS","t":"in Botany, a stem covered with strong woody prickles, whose roots are not superficial, but proceeding from the body of the stem.

His father was a Jew of Portugal, by profession a merchant. After being taught Latin by a physician, he applied himself for many years to the study of theology, and afterwards devoted himself entirely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. He began very early to be dissatisfied with the Jewish religion; and as his temper was open, he did not conceal his doubts from the synagogue. The Jews, it is said, offered to tolerate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>, and even promised him a pension of a thousand dollars per annum, if he would remain in their society, and continue outwardly to practise their ceremonies. But if this offer was really made, he rejected it, perhaps from his aversion to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOCRISY\">hypocrisy</a>, or rather because he could not endure the restraint which it would have imposed. He also refused being constituted heir to an independent fortune, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of the natural claimants; and he learned the art of polishing glass for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a>, that he might subsist independently of every one.\n\nHe would probably have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the synagogue for some time longer, had it not been for an accident. As he was returning home one evening from the theatre, he was stabbed by a Jew: the wound was slight; but the attempt naturally led Spinoza to conclude that the Jews had formed the design of assassinating him. After leaving the synagogue, he became a Christian, and frequented the churches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUTHERANS\">Lutherans</a> and Calvinists. He now devoted himself more than ever to his favourite philosophical speculations; and finding himself frequently interrupted by the visits of his friends, he left Amsterdam, and settled at the Hague, where he often continued for three months together without ever stirring from his lodging. During his residence in that city, his hostess, who was a Lutheran, asked him one day if he could be saved while he continued in her religion? \"Yes (replied Spinoza), provided you join to your religion a peaceable and virtuous life.\" From this answer it has been concluded that he was a Christian in appearance only, while in reality he regarded all religions as indifferent. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> would be too severe, even if the woman had been a Mahometan. His Tractatus Theologico-politicus, which was published about that time, is a better proof of his sincerity than a thousand such conclusions; for this book contains all those doctrines in embryo which were afterwards unfolded in his Opera Posthuma, and which are generally considered as a system of atheism.\n\nHis fame, which had now spread far and wide, obliged him sometimes to interrupt his philosophical reveries. Learned men visited him from all quarters. While the prince of Conde commanded the French army in Utrecht, he intreated Spinoza to visit him; and though he was absent when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> arrived, he returned immediately, and spent a considerable time with him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>. The elector Palatine offered to make Spinoza professor of philosophy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEIDELBERG\">Heidelberg</a>; which, however, he declined.\n\nHe died of consumption at the Hague on the 21st February 1677, at the age of 45. His life was a perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to his opinions. He was temperate, liberal, and remarkably disinterested; he was forcible, affable, and friendly. His conversation was agreeable and instructive, and never deviated from the strictest propriety.\n\nThe only edition of the works of Spinoza that we have seen is in two volumes small 4to; the former of which was printed at Hamburg in the year 1670, and the latter we know not where, in 1677, a few months after his death. In the Tractatus Theologico-politicus, already mentioned, he treats of prophecy and prophets; and of the call of the Hebrews, whom he affirms to have been distinguished from other nations only by the admirable form of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and the fitness of their laws for long preserving their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> state. He is likewise of opinion, or at least pretends to be so, that God may, in what we call a supernatural way, have given political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTES\">institutes</a> to other nations as well as to the Hebrews, who were, he says, at no time a peculiar people to the Supreme Lord of heaven and earth; for according to him, all history, sacred and profane, testifies that every nation was blest with the light of prophecy. That light indeed, if his notions of it be just, was of very little value. He labours to prove, that the prophets were distinguished from other men only by their piety and virtue; that their revelations depended wholly on their imaginations and the dispositions of their minds; that they were often grossly ignorant and highly prejudiced; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> opinions of one prophet are seldom in unison with those of another; and that their writings are valuable to us only for the excellent rules which he acknowledges they contain respecting the practice\ntice of piety and virtue. He then proceeds to treat of the divine law and of miracles; and endeavours to prove that no miracle, in the proper sense of the word, can have been at any time performed; because every thing happens by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of nature, the result of the divine decrees, which are from all eternity necessary themselves. He acknowledges, that in the Scriptures, which he professes to admit as true history, miracles are often mentioned; but he says that they were only singular events which the sacred historians imagined to be miraculous: and he then gives some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> rules for interpreting the books of the Old and New Testaments where they treat of miracles, or appear to foretell future events. See our articles MIRACLE and PROPHECY.\n\nHaving thus divested the Scriptures of every thing characteristic of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> from heaven, he next calls in question their authenticity. He affirms, in contradiction to the clearest internal evidence, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTATEUCH\">Pentateuch</a> and all the other historical books must have been written by one man; and that man, he thinks, could not have flourished at a period earlier than that of Ezra. The grounds of this opinion are unworthy of the talents of Spinoza; for that he had talents is incontrovertible. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> objection to the authenticity of the Pentateuch is, that Moses is made to speak of himself in the third person, and to talk of the Canaanites being then in the land; and because he finds in his writings, as well as in the books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, &c., places denominated by names which he supposes they had not in the early ages of which these books contain the history, he concludes that these writings must be one compilation from ancient records made at a very late period; more especially as the author often speaks of things of great antiquity remaining to this day. The books of Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles, must have been compiled, he thinks, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MACCABEES\">Maccabees</a>; and he seems to consider as of equal value with them the story of Tobit, and the other two apocryphal treaties intitled the Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus.\n\nThese fancies cavils, worthy only of one of those modern freethinkers whose learning, in the opinion of Bishop Warburton, is not sufficient to carry them even to the confines of rational doubt, we have sufficiently obviated in another place (see SCRIPTURE, No. 8\u201431.) Spinoza urges them against the other books of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. The prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, and Jonah, are, as we have them, only fragments, he says, of the writings of those men compiled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a> under the second temple from ancient and voluminous records.\n\nIn the midst of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DOGMATICAL\">dogmatical</a> skepticism, if we may use such a phrase, he bears such a testimony to the last chapters of the book of Daniel, as we should not have looked for in the writings either of a Jew or of a Deist. After detailing the various hypotheses which in his time were held respecting the author and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of the book of Job; in which, he says, Momus is called Satan, he proceeds in these words: \"Tranfco ad Danielis librum; hic fine dubio ex cap. 8. ipsius Danielis scripta continet. Undemam autem priora septem capitata descripta fuerint, necio?\" thus admitting the famous prophecy of the seventy weeks. The canon of the Old Testament, he says, was finally settled by rabbins of the Pharisaical sect, who wished to exclude from it the books of Proverbs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTES\">Ecclesiastes</a>, and Ezekiel, as they had actually excluded others of equal value; but the three books in question were inserted by the influence of two of the rabbis of greater wisdom and integrity than the rest.\n\nThat so paradoxical a writer, who had been originally a Jew, and was now almost a Deist, should have treated the New Testament with as little ceremony as the Old, will not surprise the intelligent reader. He begins his remarks, however, with affirming, that no man can peruse the Christian Scriptures, and not acknowledge the apostles to have been prophets; but he thinks that their mode of prophesying was altogether different from that which prevailed under the Mosaic dispensation; and that the gift, whatever it was, forsook them the instant that they left off preaching, as their writings have to him every appearance of human compositions. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between Christian and Jewish prophecy is the more wonderful, that he founds it principally on the dissimilarity of style visible in the writings of the Old and New Testaments; though, in his second chapter, which treats of the works of the Jewish prophets, he says expressly, \"Stylus deinde prophetiae pro eloquentia cujusque prophete variabat, prophetiae enim Ezekielis et Amos non sunt, ut illae Esai\u00e6, Nachum, eleganti, sed rudiore stylo script\u00e6.\" That the Hebrew scholar may be convinced of the truth of this remark, he recommends to him to study diligently the writings of these prophets, and to consider the occasions on which their prophecies were uttered: \"Quae si omnia rect\u00e8 perpendatur (says he) facile intelligantur, Deum nullum habere stylum peculiarem dicendi, sed tantum pro eruditione, et capacitate prophet\u00e6 extens\u00e6 elegantiem, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENDIUM\">compendium</a>, severum, rudem, prolixum, et obscurum.\" Another objection brought by Spinoza against the prophecies of the New Testament arises from the authors of them having been at all times matters of themselves. This, says he, was peculiarly the case of St Paul, who often confirms his doctrine by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, which the Jewish prophets never condescended to do, as it would have submitted their dogmas to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of private judgment. Yet, with singular inconsistency, he affirms, that the Jewish prophets could not know that the impressions made on their imaginations proceeded from God, but by a sign given them, which by their own reason or judgment they knew would never be vouchsafed to an impious or a wicked man.\n\nAfter these very free remarks on the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, he naturally enough expresses a suspicion, that by those who consider the Bible as the epistle of God sent from heaven to men, he will be thought to have sinned against the Holy Ghost by vilifying his dictates. This leads him to inquire in what sense the Scriptures are the word of God; and he gravely determines them to be so only as they actually contribute to make men more virtuous and holy. It is not enough that they are calculated to improve virtue and holiness: for should the words of the languages in which they are written acquire in process of time a significance different from what they had originally? Should mankind lose all knowledge of these languages; or even should they agree to neglect the books, whether from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> or from wilfulness\u2014these books would cease\nto be the word of God, and become nothing better than waste paper and ink; just as the two tables, which Moses broke on observing the idolatry of his countrymen, were not the covenant between Jehovah and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a>, but merely two pieces of stone! The Scriptures, however, are the word of God, because they teach the true religion of which God is the author; and they have taught it in such a manner, he says, that it can never be lost or corrupted whatever becomes of the books of the Old and New Testaments, or of the languages in which they are written. The whole of religion, as the Scriptures themselves testify, consists in the love of God above all things, and of our neighbours as ourselves; whence it follows, that we must believe that God exists, and watch over all things by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>; that he is omnipotent, and has decreed the pious to be ultimately happy, and the impious miserable; and that our final <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> depends solely on His grace or favour. These truths, with their necessary consequences, are the word of God: they are clearly taught in the Scriptures, and can never be corrupted; but every thing else in these volumes is vain, he says, and of no greater importance to us than facts related in any other ancient and authentic history.\n\nSuch are the opinions which were entertained of revelation by a man, whom a critic, writing in a Christian country, and professing to be a zealous Christian himself, has lately pronounced to have been a chosen vessel. For what purpose he was chosen it is not easy to conceive. His religion, as it appears in the Tractatus, is the worst kind of Deism; and his politics are such as our monthly critics are not wont to teach, and such as we trust shall never be seriously taught by any British subject. By the law of nature, he says, every man before the formation of civil government has an unquestionable right to whatever appears eligible either to his reason or to his appetites; and may get possession of it by treachery, by violence, by fraud, or by any other means attended with less trouble to himself (five vi, five dolo, five precibus, five quocunque demum modo facilius poterit); and may treat as an enemy every person who shall attempt to obstruct his purpose. But when men agree to devolve this right upon others, and to constitute a political state, which both reason and appetite must persuade them to do, then are they in duty bound to obey every mandate of the government, however absurd it may be (omnia mandata tamei ab iuridiffima), as long as that government can enforce its edicts, and no longer; for, according to him, right and power are inseparably united, that when a government loses its power, it has no longer the smallest claim to obedience. This doctrine, he says, is most obviously just when taught of democratical governments; but it is in fact equally true of monarchies and aristocracies: \"Nam quisquis summam habet potestatem, five unus fit, five pauci, five deique omnes, certum est ei summum jus quicquid velit imperandi, competere: et praetera quisquis potestatem se defendendi, five sponte, five vi coactus, in alium transiuit, eum quo jure naturali plane cessisse, et consequenter eadem ad omnia absoluti parere decrevi: quod omnia praestare tenetur, quamdiu rex, five nobiles, five populus summam, quam accepunt, potestatem, quo juris transferendi fundamentum fuit, conservant; nec his plura addere opus est.\" We heartily agree with him, that to this precious conclusion it is needless to add a single word.\n\nTaking our leave therefore of his Tractatus Theologico-politicus, we shall now give our readers a short account of his Opera Posthuma. These consist of: 1. Ethica, more geometrico demonstrata; 2. Politica; 3. De Emendatione Intellectus; 4. Epistolae, et ad eas Responsiones; 5. Compendium Grammatices Linguae Hebrae\u00e6.\n\nThe Ethica are divided into five parts, which treat in order, de Deo; de natura et origine mentis; de origine et natura affectuum; de servitute humana, seu de affectuum viribus; de potentia intellectus, seu de libertate humana. As the author professes to tread in the footsteps of the geometers, and to deduce all his conclusions by rigid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> from a few self-evident truths, he introduces his work, after the manner of Euclid, with a collection of definitions and axioms. These are couched in terms generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a>; and therefore the reader will do well to consider attentively in what sense, if in any, they can be admitted; for it will not be found easy to grant his premises, and at the same time refuse his conclusions. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of substance, for instance, is so expressed as to admit of two senses; in one of which it is just, whilst in the other it is the parent of the most impious absurdity. We shall give it in his own words: \"Per substantiam intelligo id, quod in se est, et per se concipitur: hoc est id, cuius conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei, a quo formari debeat.\" If by this be meant, that a substance is that which we can conceive by itself without attending to any thing else, or thinking of its formation, the definition, we believe, will be admitted by every reflecting mind as sufficiently distinguishing the thing defined from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a>, which, he says, is that which we perceive of a substance, and which we certainly cannot conceive as existing by itself. Thus the writer of this article can shut his eyes and contemplate in idea the small to volume now before him, without attending to anything else, or thinking of its paradoxical author, or even of the Great Being who created the matter both of him and of it; but he cannot for an instant contemplate the yellow colour of its vellum boards without thinking of triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, or, in other words, of body. The book therefore is a falsehood, because conceivable by itself; the colour is an attribute or quality, because it cannot be conceived by itself, but necessarily leads to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of something else. But if Spinoza's meaning be, that nothing is a substance but what is conceived as existing from eternity, independent of every thing as a cause, his definition cannot be admitted; for every man conceives that which in himself thinks, and wills, and is conscious, as a substance; at the same time that he has the best evidence possible that he existed not as a conscious, thinking, and active being, from eternity.\n\nHis fourth axiom is thus expressed: \"Effectus cognitionis a cognitione causae dependet, et eandem involvit;\" and his fifth, \"Quae nihil commune cum se invicem habent, etiam per se invicem intelligi non possunt, five conceptus unius alterius conceptum non involvit.\" The former of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, so far from being self-evident, is not even true; and the latter is capable of two senses very different from each other. That every ef-\nSpinoza: first proceeds from a cause, is indeed an axiom; but surely we may know the effect accurately, though we be ignorant of the particular cause from which it proceeds (see Philosophy, No. 36; and Physics, No. 91, &c.) nor does the knowledge of the one by any means involve the knowledge of the other. If different things have nothing in common, it is indeed true that the knowledge of one of them will not give us an adequate conception of the other; but it will in many cases compel us to believe, that the other exists or has existed. A parcel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> lying at rest has nothing in common with the velocity of a cannon-ball; yet when we know that a ball has been driven with velocity from a cannon, we infer with certainty that there has been a parcel of powder at rest in the chamber of that cannon.\n\nIt is upon such ambiguous definitions and axioms as these that Spinoza has raised his pretended demonstrations, that one substance cannot produce another; that no substance exists or can be conceived besides God; and that extended substance or body is one of the infinite attributes of God. We shall not waste our time or the readers with a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of these impious absurdities. We trust they are sufficiently confuted in other articles of this work (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, Part III. Providence, and Theology, Part I.) and whoever wishes for a more particular examination of the author's principles, may find it in Dr Clarke's Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God. The truth, however, is, that no man will need the assistance of that eminent metaphysician to discover the fallacy of the reasoning by which they are attempted to be proved, if he affix any one precise meaning to the definitions and axioms, and adhere to that meaning steadily through the whole process of the pretended demonstrations.\n\nBy way of apology for this jargon, it has lately been said, that \"Spinoza takes the word substance in its most simple and perfect sense; which is necessary, as he writes mathematically, and proposes a simple idea as the foundation of his theory. What is the proper signification of a substance? Is it not that which stands alone, which has the cause of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> within itself? I wish that this simple meaning of the word could be universally admitted in philosophy. Strictly speaking, no worldly thing is a substance; since all mutually depend on each other, and finally on God, who, in this exalted sense, is the only substance. The word modification sounds harsh and improper, and therefore it cannot be expected to gain a place in philosophy; but if the school of Leibnitz may term matter the appearance of substances, why may not Spinoza be allowed a bolder term? Worldly substances are kept in union by divine power, as it was by divine power that they had existence. They represent also, if you please, modified appearances of divine power; each according to the station, the time, and the organs, in and with which it appears. The phrase used by Spinoza is concise, and it gives an unity and simplicity to his whole system, however strange it may found in our ears.\"\n\nFrom this account of Spinozism, one who had never looked into the works of the author would be led to suppose that his system is the same with that of Berkeley; which, denying the existence of material substance, attributes all our perceptions of what we call the qualities of body to the immediate agency of the Deity on our minds (see Metaphysics, Part II. chap. 3.). But Spinoza's doctrine is very different. According to him, bodies are either attributes or affections of God; and as he says there is but one extended substance, he affirms that substance to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVISIBLE\">indivisible</a>, and employs a long fallacy to prove that those are mistaken who suppose it finite and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to the Deity. That we do Prop. xiv. not misrepresent his sentiments, the learned reader will see be convinced by the two following definitions, with which he introduces that part of his ethics which treats of the nature and origin of mind.\n\n1. \"Per corpus intelligi modum, qui Dei efflentiam, quatenus, ut res extensa consideratur, certo et determinato modo exprimit.\"\n\n2. \"Ad efflentiam aliquius rei id pertinere dico, quo dato res necessefario ponitur, et quo fublato res necessefario tollitur; vel id, fine quo res, et vice versa quod sine re nec effe nec concipi potest.\" In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with these definitions, he attempts to prove that God is an extended as well as a thinking substance; that as a thinking substance he is the cause of the idea of a circle, Prop. vii. and as an extended substance of the circle itself; and xi. Part ii. that the minds of men are not substances, but certain modifications of the divine attributes; or, as he sometimes expresses it, \"Quod humanae mentis actualis constituit, est idea rei singularis actu existentis.\" Hence, he says, it follows that the human mind is a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> of the infinite God; so that when we speak of the human mind perceiving this or that, we can only mean that God, not as he is infinite, but as he appears in the human mind or constitutes its essence, has this or that idea; and when we speak of God's having this or that idea, we must conceive of Him not only as constituting the human mind, but as, together with it, having the idea of something else (A). In another place he tells us, that the human mind is nothing but the idea which God has of the human body as actually existing; that this idea of the body, and the body itself, are one and the same thing; and that thinking and extended substances are in reality but one and the same substance, which is sometimes comprehended under one attribute of the Deity, and sometimes under another*.\n\nIf this impious jargon be not Atheism, or as it has been sometimes called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANTHEISM\">Pantheism</a>, we know not what it is (See Pantheism). According to Spinoza, there is but one substance, which is extended, infinite, and indivisible. That substance indeed he calls God; but he labours to prove that it is corporeal; that there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between mind and matter; that both are attributes\n\n---\n\n(A) Hinc sequitur mentem humanam partem esse infiniti intellectus Dei; ac proinde cum dicimus, mentem humanam hoc vel illud percipere, nihil aliud dicimus quam quod Deus, non quatenus insinitus est, sed quatenus per naturam humanae mentis explicatur, sive quatenus humanae mentis efflentiam constituit, hanc vel illam habet ideam: et cum dicimus Deum hanc vel illam ideam habere, non tantum, quatenus naturam humanae mentis constituit; sed quatenus simul cum mente humana alterius rei etiam habet ideam. Corol. prop. xi. part 2.\ntributes of the Deity variously considered; that the human soul is a part of the intellect of God; that the same soul is nothing but the idea of the human body; that this idea of the body, and the body itself, are one and the same thing; that God could not exist, or be conceived, were the visible universe annihilated; and therefore that the visible universe is either the one substance, or at least an essential attribute or modification of that substance. He sometimes indeed speaks of the power of this substance; but when he comes to explain himself, we find that by power he means nothing but blind necessity*; and though he frequently talks of the wisdom of God, he seems to make use of the word without meaning. This we think evident from the long appendix to his 36th proposition; in which he labours to prove that the notion of final causes is an idle figment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, since, according to him, nothing but the prejudices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> could have led men to fancy that there is any real distinction between good and evil, merit and demerit, praise and reproach, order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>; that eyes were given them that they might be enabled to see; teeth for the purpose of chewing their food; herbs and animals for the matter of that food; that the sun was formed to give light, or the ocean to nourish fish. If this be true, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to discover wisdom in the operations of his one substance; since, in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, it is the very characteristic of folly to act without any end in view.\n\nSuch are the reveries of that writer, whose works a German philosopher of some name has lately recommended to the public, as calculated to convey to the mind more just and sublime conceptions of God than are to be found in most other systems. The recommendation has had its effect. A literary journalist of our own, reviewing the volume in which it is given, feels a peculiar satisfaction from the discovery, that Spinoza, instead of a formidable enemy to the cause of virtue and religion, was indeed their warmest friend; and piously hopes that we shall become more cautious not to suffer ourselves to be deceived by empty names, which those who cannot reason (Sir Isaac Newton and Dr Clarke perhaps) give to those who can (Hobbes, we suppose, and Spinoza). But though we have the honour to think on this question with our illustrious countrymen, we have no desire to depict Spinoza as a reprovable, which the critic says has often been done by ignorance and enthusiasm. We admit that his conduct in active life was irreproachable; and for his speculative opinions, he must stand or fall to his own Master. His Ethics appear to us indeed a system shockingly impious; and in the tract entitled Politica, power and right are confounded as in the former volume; but in the treatise De Intellectus Emendatione, are scattered many precepts of practical wisdom, as well as some judicious rules for conducting philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>; and we only regret, that the reader must wade through pages of fatality, scepticism, and palpable contradictions. His Compendium Grammaticae Linguae Hebraeae, though left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, appears to have so much merit, that it is to be wished he had fulfilled his intention of writing a philosophical grammar of that language, instead of wasting his time on arbitrary speculations, which though they seem not to have been injurious to his own virtue, are certainly not calculated to promote the virtue of others, or to increase the sum of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>.\n\nSPIR\u00c6A, a genus of plants belonging to the class of icoandria, and to the order of pentagynia; and in the natural system arranged under the 26th order, Pomace\u00e6.

This has naturally occasioned a nice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of their strength. It having been at last found that this was intimately connected with the specific gravity, this has been examined with the most scrupulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to every circumstance which could affect it, so that the duties might be exactly proportioned to the quantity of spirit in any strong liquor, independent on every other circumstance of flavour or taste, or other valued quality. The chemist at last found that the basis of all strong liquors is the same, produced by the vinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> of pure saccharine matter dissolved in water. He also found, that whether this vegetable salt be taken as it is spontaneously formed in the juices of plants and fruits, or as it may be formed or extracted from farinaceous fruits and roots by a certain part of the process of vegetation, it produces the same ardent spirit, which has always the same density in every mixture with water. The minute portions of aromatic oils, which are in some degree inseparable from it, and give it a different flavour according to the substance from which it was obtained, are not found to have any sensible effect on its density or specific gravity. This seems very completely established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the unwearyed attempts of the manufacturers to lessen the duties payable on their goods by mixtures of other substances, which would increase their density without making them less palatable. The vigilance of the revenue officers was no less employed to detect every such contrivance. In short, it is now an acknowledged point, that the specific gravity is an accurate test of the strength.\n\nBut though this is true in general, we cannot derive much benefit from it, unless we know the precise relation between the strength and the density of a spirituous liquor. Do they increase pari passu, or by what law\nSpirituous law are they connected? It was natural to expect that equal additions of ardent spirits or alcohol to a given quantity of water would produce equal diminutions of density. Areometers were accordingly made on this principle above 200 years ago, as may be seen in the works of Gaspar Schottus, Sturmius, Agricola, and other old authors. But when mathematical physics became more generally known, this was easily discovered to be erroneous; and it was shown (we think first by Mr Boyle) that equal additions to the specific gravity would be produced by successively taking out of any vessel a certain measure of alcohol and replacing it with an equal measure of water. This was the most convenient discovery for all parties, because then the duties payable on a cask of spirits would be in the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of its density. But it was soon found by those who were appointed guardians of the revenue that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> was erroneous, and that a mixture which appeared by this rule to contain 35 gallons of alcohol did really contain 35\u00bd. They found by actually making such a mixture: 18 gallons of alcohol mixed with 18 of water produced only 35 gallons of spirits. The revenue officers, finding that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> was most remarkable in mixtures of equal parts of water and the strongest spirits which could then be procured, determined to levy the duties by this mixture; because, whether the spirituous liquor was stronger or weaker than this, it would appear, by its specific gravity, rather stronger than it really was. This sagacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, and the simplicity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, which could at all times be made for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, seem to be the reasons for our excise offices selecting this mode of estimating the strength and levying the duties. A mixture of nearly equal measures of water and alcohol is called proof spirit, and pays a certain duty per gallon; and the strength of a spirituous liquor is estimated by the gallons, not of alcohol, but of proof spirit which the cask contains. But because it might be difficult to procure at all times this proof spirit for comparison, such a mixture was made by order of the board of excise: and it was found, that when five gallons of it was mixed with one gallon of water, a wine gallon of the mixture weighed 7 pounds 13 ounces avoirdupois. The board therefore declared, that the spirituous liquor of which the gallon weighed 7 pounds 13 ounces should be reckoned 1 to 6 or 1 in 7 under proof. This is but an awkward and complex formula; it was in order to suit matters to a mode of examination which had by time obtained the sanction of the board. Mr Clarke, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> artist of that time, had made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HYDROMETER\">hydrometer</a> incomparably more exact than any other, and constructed on mathematical principles fit for computation. This had a set of weights corresponding to the additions of water or proof spirit, and the mixture 1 to 6 or 1 in 7 was the only one which weighed an exact number of ounces per gallon without a fraction.\n\nThus stands the excise law; and Clarke's hydrometer is still the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of authority, although others have been since constructed by Dicas, Quin, and others, which are much more ingenious and convenient. The mathematician who examines Dicas's hydrometer, with its sliding scale, by which it is adjusted to the different temperatures, and points out the condensations, will perceive a beautiful and sagacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of quantities, which he will find it difficult to bring under any analytical formula. Perhaps Quin's may have some preference in respect of convenience; but facile inventis addere. Mr Dicas's was originally (A).\n\nAs naturalists became more accustomed to exact observations in every topic of inquiry, the condensation which obtains in the mixture of different substances became more familiarly known. This evidently affects the present question; and both the excise and the distillers are interested in its accurate decision. This occasioned an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the Royal Society; and a most scrupulous examination of the strength of spirituous liquors was made by Sir Charles Blagden and Mr Gilpin, of which they have given a very particular account in the Philosophical Transactions for 1792 and 1793.\n\nWe have taken notice of this in the article Specific Gravity, mentioning such circumstances of the results as fitted our purposes of physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>. At present,\n\n(A) Among the various contrivances which have been thought of, among manufacturers and dealers, as well as for the purposes of revenue, for ascertaining the specific gravity, and consequently the real strength and value of high-priced and high-taxed liquids, we are persuaded there is none equal, in point of accuracy, simplicity, and facility of application, to the areometrical beads lately announced to the public by Mrs Lovi of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, under the privilege of a patent; and with this persuasion we have no hesitation in recommending them to those to whom the use of a simple and accurate instrument is of great importance in determining the value of high-priced spirituous liquors. Our recommendation rests not solely on our own opinion, but is supported by that of others who are well acquainted with such subjects. We know, too, that the beads have been examined and compared by several intelligent manufacturers and dealers with some of the most accurate hydrometrical instruments, and after a fair trial, a decided preference has been given to the beads. The whole apparatus consists of 30 beads, a sliding rule, a thermometer, a glass jar and brass hook, which are packed in a neat small box; and it is accompanied with directions, which point out, 1. In what manner the real strength of spirits may be ascertained at any given temperature between 40\u00b0 and 80\u00b0; 2. How much per cent. the spirit to be tried is over or under proof according to the practice of spirit-dealers; and, 3. The proportion of water and the strongest spirits or alcohol, according to the views and language of excisemen. The advantages of these beads are, that being made of a substance which is little acted on by chemical agents, they are less liable to be injured by use, than instruments composed of metal; and when a bead happens to be broken, it can be easily replaced. They possess this farther advantage, that with the application of the thermometer, and the calculation of the sliding rule, the real strength of the spirits may be taken at all temperatures. It has been suggested, that these beads, from their being less liable to change than other instruments, might be usefully employed in checking the errors and variations of other hydrometers. Beads are prepared by Mrs Lovi on the same principle for ascertaining the strength of worts, acids, &c.,\nSpiritous sent we give the general result in the table of specific gravity, as peculiarly belonging to spiritous liquors, affording the most exact account of their density in every state of dilution of alcohol with water. And as the relation between the proportion of ingredients and the density is peculiar to every substance, so that scarcely any inference can be made from one to another, the reader will consider the tables here given as characteristic with respect to alcohol. In all solutions of salts we found that the condensation increases continually with the dilution, whereas it is greatest when equal bulks of water and alcohol are mixed; yet we do not consider this as an exception; for it is certain, that in the strongest brine the saline ingredient bears but a small proportion to the water\u2014and when we mix two solutions, the condensation is greatest when they are nearly equal in bulk. But we think ourselves entitled to infer, that alcohol is not a dilution of a substance in a quantity of water; but that water, in a certain proportion, not very distant from what we can produce by slow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, is an ingredient of alcohol, or is one of its component parts, and not merely a vehicle or menstruum. We therefore imagine that proof spirit contains nearly equal bulks of water and ardent spirits.\n\nThe great difficulty in this examination arose from the very different expansions of water and alcohol by heat. This determined Sir Charles Blagden to estimate the proportions of ingredients by weight, and make it absolutely necessary to give a scale of specific gravity and strength for every temperature. For it must be remarked, that the question (whether in commerce or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>) always is, \"How many gallons of alcohol and of water, taken just now and mixed together, will produce a hundred gallons of the spirit we are examining?\" The proportion of these two will be different according to the temperature of both. As many mixtures therefore must have been made in each proportion as there were temperatures considered; but by taking the ingredients by weight, and examining the density of the compound in one temperature, it is then heated and cooled, and its change of density observed. Calculation then can tell us the change in the proportion of the bulks or numbers of gallons in the mixture, by means of a previous table showing the expansions of water and of alcohol.\n\nThe alcohol selected for this examination had the specific gravity 0.825. This is not the purest that can be procured; some was produced of 0.816, of 0.814, and 0.813, both obtained from rum, from brandy, and from malt spirit. We are informed that Dr Black has obtained it of the specific gravity 0.8 by digesting alcohol with fixed ammonia (muriatic acid united with lime) made very dry. It dephlegmates alcohol very powerfully without decomposing it, which always happens when we use caustic alkali. Alcohol of 0.825 was chosen because expressed by a number of easy management in computation.\n\nThe examination commenced by ascertaining the expansions of water and alcohol. The temperature 60\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's scale was selected for the general temperature of comparison, being easily attainable even in cold weather, and allowing the examiner to operate at ease. The first and last compartments of the tables contain the weights and specific gravities of alcohol and water for every fifth degree of heat from 30\u00b0 to 100\u00b0.\n\nFrom these we have constructed the two following little spiritous tables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>. The bulk of 1000 ounces, pounds, or other weight of water and of alcohol of the temperature 60\u00b0, occupies the bulks expressed in the tables for every other temperature. Water could not be easily or usefully examined when of the temperature 30\u00b0, because it is with great difficulty kept fluid in that temperature. It is very remarkable, that when it can be so kept, it expands instead of contracting; while cooling down from 35\u00b0 or thereabouts, and as it approaches to 30\u00b0, it expands rapidly. We observe the same thing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a> of Glauber salt, martial vitriol, and some others, which contain much water in their crystals. We observe, on the other hand, a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> in the zeolite just before its beginning to swell into bubbles by a red heat.\n\n| Heat | Bulk of 1000 ounces |\n|------|-------------------|\n|      | Of Water | Diff. | Of Alcohol | Diff. |\n| 30\u00b0  |         |       |            |       |\n| 35   | 99910   | 4     | 119195     | 319   |\n| 40   | 99976   | 8     | 119514     | 325   |\n| 45   | 99914   | 18    | 119839     | 332   |\n| 50   | 99932   | 30    | 120172     | 342   |\n| 55   | 99902   | 38    | 120514     | 348   |\n| 60   | 100000  | 50    | 120868     | 350   |\n| 65   | 100050  | 56    | 121212     | 355   |\n| 70   | 100106  | 64    | 121565     | 353   |\n| 75   | 100170  | 71    | 121919     | 354   |\n| 80   | 100241  | 79    | 122279     | 360   |\n| 85   | 100320  | 84    | 122645     | 366   |\n| 90   | 100404  | 96    | 123017     | 372   |\n| 95   | 100500  | 108   | 123393     | 376   |\n| 100  | 100608  | 128   | 123773     | 380   |\n\nThis being premised, the examination was conducted in the following manner. It was determined to mix 100 parts by weight of pure alcohol with five, ten, fifteen, twenty, parts of distilled water, till they were compounded in equal quantities, and then to mix 100 parts of distilled water with 95, 90, 85, 80, &c., parts of alcohol, till they were mixed in the proportion of 100 to 5. Thus a series of mixtures would be obtained, extending from pure alcohol to pure water. This series would be such, that the examinations would be most frequent in the cases most usual in the commerce of strong liquors. A set of phials, fitted with ground stoppers, were provided, of sizes fit to hold the intended mixtures. These mixtures were made by suspending the phial to the arm of a very nice balance, in the opposite scale of which (besides the counterpoise of the phial) there was placed the weight 100. Spirit was then poured into the phial till it exactly balanced the weight 100. The weight for the water to be added was then put into the opposite scale, and water was poured into the phial by means of a slender glass funnel, by small quantities at a time, and the phial frequently agitated to promote the mixture. When the additional weight was exactly balanced, the phial was taken off, its stopper put in, and leather tied over it, and it was let by, for at least a month, that the mixture and the whole process of condensation might be completed. The same method\nSPI\n\nSpirits method was followed in the mixtures where the water was predominant.\n\nWhen the ingredients of these mixtures were judged to have completely incorporated, their specific gravity was examined by weighing with the most scrupulous precision the contents of a vessel which held 2925 troy grains of water, of the temperature 60\u00b0. The balance was so exceedingly sensitive, that the 50th part of a grain greatly deranged its position when loaded with the scales and their contents. It was constructed by Mr Ramsden, and some account of its exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> may be seen in the Journal de Physique, vol. xxxiii. This quantity of materials was therefore thought abundantly sufficient for ascertaining the density of the liquor. It is needless to detail the precautions which were taken for having the contents of the weighing bottle brought to the precise temperature proper for the experiment. They were such as every person conversant with such things is accustomed to take.\u2014The bottle had a slender neck, and being put on a lathe, a mark was made round it with a diamond. The bottle was filled till the bottom of the hollow surface of the fluid was in the plane of this mark; and to judge of the accuracy attainable in filling the bottle, the operation was several times repeated and the contents weighed, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of 1/50th of a grain in 2925. The only source of error which was to be guarded against was air-bubbles adhering to the inside of the bottle, or moisture condensing (in the experiments with low temperatures) on the outside. Both of these were attended to as much as possible.\n\nThis method of determining the specific gravity was preferred to the usual method, observing the weight lost by a lump of glass when suspended in water; for Mr Gilpin had been enabled, by means of this nice balance, to discover, even in pure water and in alcohol, a want of perfect fluidity. Something like viscosity rendered the motion of a lump of glass through the liquor sensibly sluggish, so that when the balance was brought to a level, there was not a perfect equilibrium of weights: (See what we have said of this matter in Specific Gravity). Mr Gilpin also tried the ingenious instrument proposed for such experiments by Mr Ramsden, and described by him in a pamphlet on this very subject; and he found the anomalies of experiment much greater than in this method by weighing.\u2014Indeed the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a> of weights to be seen in the annexed tables is an unquestionable proof of the sufficiency of the method; and it has the evident advantage of all other methods in point of simplicity and practicability without any uncommon apparatus. Any person possessed of a good ordinary balance and a set of exact weights may examine all questions of this kind, by weighing pure water and the liquor which he may have occasion to examine in a common 6 or 8 ounce phial. For this reason, it is recommended (in preference to all hydrometers) to the board of excise to provide this simple apparatus in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> office.\n\nEvery experiment was made at least three times; and the mean result (which never differed one grain from the extreme) was taken.\n\nFrom these experiments the annexed tables were constructed. The first is the simple abstract of the experiments, containing the weights of the contents of the bottle of every mixture. The second contains the specific gravities deduced from them.\n\nWe have said that the experiments appear surprisingly accurate. This we say on the authority of the regular progression of the specific gravity in any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> rows. In the series, for instance, for the temperature 60\u00b0, the greatest anomaly is in the mixture of 50 parts of spirit with 100 of water. The specific gravity is 95804, wanting 3 or 4 of the regular progression. This does not amount to 1 in 18000.\n### Table I.

specific gravities for various temperatures and volumes of spirit relative to water. Each row corresponds to a different temperature in degrees (deg.), and each column represents the ratio of spirit to water for different grain volumes.\nWe formerly observed, that the series of mixtures chosen by Sir Charles Blagden, for the advantages attending it in making the experiment, was not suited for solving the questions which commonly occur in the spirit business. He accordingly suggests the propriety of forming tables in a convenient series from the data furnished by these experiments, indicating the proportion of ingredients contained in some constant weight or bulk.\n\nTo facilitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of such tables, it is necessary to consider the subject in the most general manner. Therefore let \\(a\\) represent the constant number 100. Let \\(w\\) and \\(s\\) represent the quantities of water and spirit by weight in any mixture; that is, the pounds, ounces, or grains of each. Let \\(x\\) represent the quantity per cent. of spirits also by weight; that is, the number of pounds of spirits contained in 100 pounds of the mixture; and let \\(y\\) be its quantity per cent. in gallons, or the number of gallons contained in 100 gallons of the unmixed ingredients. Let \\(m\\) be the bulk of a pound of spirit of any given temperature, the bulk of a pound of water of the same temperature being accounted 1.\n\nThen \\(w + s\\) is the weight of any mixture, and \\(w + m s\\) is its bulk.\n\nWe have the following proportions:\n\n1. \\(w + s = a : x\\)\n2. \\(w + m s = a : y\\), and \\(y = \\frac{m s}{w + m s}\\)\n\nThe usual questions which can be solved from these experiments are,\n\n1. To ascertain the quantity of spirits per cent. in bulk from observation of the specific gravity, or to tell how many gallons of spirit are in 100 gallons of mixture.\n\nLook for the specific gravity in the table, and at the head of the column will be found the \\(w\\) and \\(s\\) corresponding. If the precise specific gravity observed is not in the tables, the \\(s\\) must be found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPOLATION\">interpolation</a>. And here it is proper to remark, that taking the simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> parts of specific gravity will not be sufficiently exact, especially near the beginning or the end of the table, because the densities corresponding to the series of mixtures do not change uniformly. We must have recourse to the general rules of interpolation, by means of first and second differences, or be provided with a subsidiary table of differences. A good deal of practice in computations of this kind suggested the following method of making such interpolations with great dispatch and abundant accuracy. On a plate of wood or metal, Plate CCCCXIX or stiff card-paper, draw a line EF (fig. 1), as a scale of equal parts, representing the leading or equable arithmetical series of any table. (In the present case EF is the scale on which \\(s\\) is computed.)\u2014Through every point of division draw the perpendiculars BA, EC, FD, &c. Make one of them AB more conspicuous than the rest, and distinguish the others also in such sort, that the eye shall readily catch their distance from the principal line AB. Let GPL be a thin slip of whalebone, Liquors of uniform breadth and thickness, also divided into equal parts properly distinguishable. Lastly, let there be a pin P fixed near the middle of the principal line AB.\n\nNow suppose that a value of \\(s\\) is to be interpolated by means of an observed specific gravity not in the table. Look for the nearest to it, and note its distance from the preceding and the following. Let these be PH and PK on the flexible scale. Also take notice of the lines K 10 and H 10, whose distances from AB are equal to the constant difference between the successive values of \\(S\\), or to any easily estimated multiple of it (as in the present case we have taken 10 and 10, instead of 5 and 5, the running difference of Sir Charles Blagden's table). Then, leaning the middle point P of the whalebone on the pin P in the board, bend it, and place it flatwise till the points K and H fall somewheres on the two parallels K 10 and H 10. No matter how oblique the position of the whalebone is. It will bend in such a manner that its different points of division (representing different specific gravities) will fall on the parallels which represent the corresponding values of \\(s\\). We can say that all this may be done in less than half a minute, and less time than is necessary for inspecting a table of proportional parts, and not the tenth part of that necessary for interpolating by second differences. Yet it is exact enough (if of the size of a duodecimo page) for interpolating three decimal places. This is ten times more exact than the present case requires. To return from this digression.\n\nHaving thus found \\(s\\) in the table, we get \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) by the equations\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a s}{w + s} = x, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{m s}{w + m s} = y.\n\\]\n\nBut here a material circumstance occurs. The weight of alcohol \\(s\\), and its percentage \\(x\\), was rightly determined by the specific gravity, because it was interpolated between two values, which were experimentally connected with this specific gravity. But in making the transition from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), we only give the percentage in gallons before mixture, but not the number of gallons of alcohol contained in an hundred gallons of mixed liquor. For when we have taken \\(a - y\\) and \\(y\\) instead of \\(w\\) and \\(s\\), they will indeed make a similar compound when mixed, because the proportion of their ingredients is the same. But they will not make 100 gallons of this compound, because there is a shrinking or condensation by mixture, and the specific gravity by which we interpolated \\(s\\) is the physical or real specific gravity corresponding to \\(w\\) and \\(s\\); while \\(\\frac{w + s}{w + m s}\\), the specific gravity implied in the value of \\(y\\), is the mathematical density independent on this condensation. Since therefore \\(y\\), together with \\(a - y\\), make less than 100 gallons of the compound, there must in 100 gallons of it be more alcohol than is expressed by \\(y\\).\n\nLet \\(G\\) be the mathematical specific gravity \\((= \\frac{w + s}{w + m s})\\), and \\(g\\) the physical or real observed specific gravity (which we cannot express algebraically); and let \\(z\\) be the gallons of alcohol really contained in 100 gallons of the compound. The bulk being inversely as the density or specific gravity, it is evident that the bulk of the compound must be to 100 gallons as \\(g\\) to\nSPI\n\nSpiritous Liquors.\n\nAnd since we want to make it fill up to 100 gallons, we must increase it in the proportion of G to g. And because this augmentation must be of the same strength with this contracted liquor, both ingredients must be increased in the proportion of G to g, and we must have \\( G : g = y : z \\), and \\( z = g \\times \\frac{y}{G} \\). Now,\n\ninstead of \\( y \\), write \\( a \\times \\frac{m s}{w + m s} \\), and instead of \\( \\frac{I}{G} \\) write \\( \\frac{w + m s}{w + s} \\), which are respectively equal to them. This gives us \\( z = g \\times \\frac{w + m s}{w + s} \\times \\frac{m s}{w + s} = g \\times \\frac{m s}{w + s} \\).\n\nAll this will be illustrated by an example.\n\nSuppose that we have observed the specific gravity of a spiritous liquor of the temperature 60\u00b0 to be 0.94128. Looking into Sir Charles Blagden's table, we find the gravities 0.94018 and 0.94296, and the s corresponding to them is 80 and 75, the water in each mixture being 100. By interpolation we obtain the s corresponding to 0.94128, viz. 78. At this temperature \\( m = \\frac{I}{0.825} = 1.21212 \\), and \\( m = 94.54545 \\). Therefore\n\n\\[ z = 0.94128 \\times 100 \\times \\frac{94.54545}{194.54545} = 49.997, \\text{ or very nearly } 50. \\]\n\nWe have seen even persons not unacquainted with subjects of this kind puzzled by this sort of paradox. \\( z \\) is said to be the percentage of spirit in the compound. The compound has the same proportion of ingredients when made up to 100 gallons as before, when \\( y \\) was said to be its percentage, and yet \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are not the same. The fact is, that although \\( z \\) is the number of gallons of alcohol really contained in 100 gallons of the compound, and this alcohol is in the same proportion as before to the water, this proportion is not that of 50 to 50: for if the ingredients were separated again, there would be 50 gallons of alcohol and 52,876 of water.\n\nThe proportion of the ingredients in their separate state is had by the 3rd equation \\( y = a \\times \\frac{m s}{w + m s} \\), which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to \\( G \\times \\frac{m s}{w + s} \\). For the present example \\( y \\) will be found 48.599, and \\( a - y \\), or the water per cent. 51.401, making 100 gallons of unmixed ingredients. We see then that there has been added 1.398 gallons of alcohol; and since both ingredients are augmented in the proportion of G to g, there have also been added 1.478 of water, and the whole addition for making up the 100 gallons of compound is 2.876 gallons; and if the ingredients of the compound were separate, they would amount to 102.876 gallons. This might have been found at the first, by the proportion, \\( G : g = G : 100 \\): (The addition).\n\nThe next question which usually occurs in business is to find what density will result from any proposed mixture per gallon. This question is solved by means of the equation \\( \\frac{w y}{m (a - y)} = s \\). In this examination it will be most convenient to make \\( w = a \\). If the value of \\( s \\) found in this manner falls on a value in the tables, we have the specific gravity by inspection. If not, we must interpolate.\n\nN.B. The value of \\( m \\), which is employed in these reductions, varies with the temperature. It is always obtained by dividing the specific gravity of alcohol of that temperature by the specific gravity of water of the same temperature. The quotient is the real specific gravity of alcohol for that temperature. Both of these are to be had in the first and last compartments of Sir Charles Blagden's table.\n\nThese operations for particular cases give the answers to particular occasional questions. By applying them to all the numbers in the table, tables may be constructed for solving every question by inspection.\n\nThere is another question which occurs most frequently in the excise transactions, and also in all compositions of spiritous liquors, viz. What strength will result from a mixture of two compounds of known strength, or mixing any compound with water? To solve questions of this kind by the table so often quoted, we must add into one sum the water per gallon of the different liquors. In like manner, take the sum of the spirits, and say, as the sum of the waters is to that of the alcohols, so is \\( a \\) to \\( s \\); and operate with \\( a \\) and \\( s \\) as before.\n\nAnalogous to this is the question of the duties. These are levied on proof spirit; that is, a certain duty is charged on a gallon of proof spirit; and the gauger's business is to discover how many gallons of proof spirit there is in any compound. The specification of proof spirit in our excise laws is exceedingly obscure and complex. A gallon weighing 7 pounds 13 ounces (at 55\u00b0) is accounted 1 to 6 under proof. The gallon of water contains 58476 grains, and this spirit is 54688. Its density therefore is 0.93523 at 55\u00b0, or (as may be inferred from the table) 0.9335 at 60\u00b0. This density corresponds to a mixture of 100 grains of water with 93.457 of alcohol. If this be supposed to result from the mixture of 6 gallons of alcohol with 1 of water (as is supposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGNATION\">designation</a> of 1 to 6 under proof), the gallon of proof spirits consists of 100 parts of spirits by weight, mixed with 75 parts of water. Such a spirit will have the density 0.9162 nearly.\n\nThis being premised, in order to find the gallons of proof spirits in any mixture, find the quantity of alcohol by weight, and then say, as 100 to 175, so is the alcohol in the compound to the proof spirit that may be made of it, and for which the duties must be paid.\n\nWe have considered this subject at some length, because it is of great importance in the spirit-trade to have these circumstances ascertained with precision; and because the specific gravity is the only sure criterion that can be had of the strength. Firing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, or producing a certain bubble by shaking, are very vague tests; whereas, by the specific gravity, we can very accurately ascertain the strength within one part in 500, as will presently appear.\n\nSir Charles Blagden, or Mr Gilpin, has published * Philof. a most copious set of tables, calculated from these valuable experiments. In these computations are made for every unit of the hundred, and for every degree of the thermometer. But these tables are still not in the most commodious form for business. Mr John Wilson, an ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> residing at Dundee, has just pub-\nSpiritous Lished at Edinburgh tables somewhat similar, founded on the same experiments. Both of these tables show the quantities by measure corresponding to every unit by weight of Sir Charles Blagden's experiments, and for every degree of temperature. They also show the percentage of alcohol, and the condensation or the quantity lost by mixture. But as they both retain the original series of parts by weight, which is very unusual, the spirit traders will find considerable difficulty in making use of them. Retaining this series also causes all the percentage numbers (which are the only interesting ones to the trader) to be fractional, and no answer can be had without a double interpolation.\n\nWe have therefore calculated a table in the form in which it must be most useful and acceptable to those who are engaged in the spirit trade, showing at once the specific gravity which results from any proportion of admixture in hundredth parts of the whole. This answers immediately the chief questions in the terms in which they are usually conceived and proposed. The two first or leading columns show the proportion in gallons, pints, or other cubic measures, of the mixture, the whole quantity being always 100. The second column shows the corresponding specific gravity; so that we can either find the proportion of the ingredients by the observed specific gravity, or find the gravity resulting from any proportion of the ingredients. A third column shows how much the hundred measures of the two ingredients fall short of making an hundred measures of the compound. A simple proportion, which can be done without the pen, will determine what part of this deficiency must be made up by spirit. The use of this table must now be so familiar to the reader's mind, that we need not give further instructions about it.\n\nThis is followed by another similar table, giving an immediate answer to the most usual question, \"How many measures of alcohol are there really contained in 100 measures?\" This is also accompanied by a column of condensation. It would have been somewhat more elegant, had the specific gravities in this table made the equable series and leading column. But we did not advert to this till we had computed the table, and the labour was too great to be repeated for slight reasons. The tables are only for the temperature 60\u00b0. To this the spiritous liquors can always be brought in these climates; and in cases where we cannot, a moment's inspection of Sir Charles Blagden's table will point out very nearly (or exactly, by a short computation) the necessary corrections.\n\n| Compound | Specific Gravity | Cond. per cent. |\n|----------|------------------|-----------------|\n| S.       | W.               |

class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> is to point out the proportion of ingredients, the specific gravities are computed only to four places, which will always give the answer true to \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\)th part. In the last, which is more immediately interesting to the merchant in his transactions with the excise office, the computation is carried one place further.\n\nThe consideration of the first of these two tables will furnish some useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> to the reader who is interested in the philosophy of chemical mixture, and who endeavours to investigate the nature of those forces which connect the particles of tangible matter. These vary with the distance of the particle; and therefore the law of their action, like that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, is to be discovered by measuring their sensible effects at their various distances. Their change of distance is seen in the change of density or specific gravity.\n\nDid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> densities of the water and spirit remain unchanged by mixture, the specific gravity would change by equal differences in the series of mixtures on which this table is constructed; for the bulk being always the same, the change of specific gravity must be the difference between the weight of the gallon of water which is added and that of the gallon of spirit which is taken out. The whole difference of the specific gravities of spirits and water being 1.750 parts in 10,000, the augmentation by each successive change of a measure of spirit for a measure of water would be the 100th part of this, or 17.5. But, by taking the successive differences of density as they occur in the table, we see that they are vastly greater in the first additions of water, being then about 10; after which they gradually diminish to the medium quantity 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), when water and spirits are mixed in nearly equal bulks. The differences of specific gravity still diminish, and are reduced to 9, when about 75 parts of water are mixed with 25 of spirit. The differences now increase again; and the last, when 99 parts of water are mixed with one part of spirit, the difference from the specific gravity of pure water is above 14.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> effect, therefore, of the addition of a measure of water to a great quantity of spirit is greater than the similar effect of the addition of a measure of spirits to a great quantity of water. What we call mechanical effect is the local motion, the change of distance of the particles, that the corporeal forces may again be in equilibrio. Observe, too, that this change is greater than in the proportion of the distance of the particles;\nSPIRITOUS particles; for the density of water is to that of spirits nearly as 6 to 5, and the changes of specific gravity are nearly as 6 to 3.\n\nWe also see that the changing cause, which produces the absolute condensation of each ingredient, ceases to operate when 75 parts of water have been mixed with 25 of alcohol: for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of specific gravity, from diminishing comes now to increase; and therefore, in this particular state of composition, is equable. Things are now in the same state as if we were mixing two fluids which did not act on each other, but were mutually disseminated, and whose specific gravities are nearly as 9 to 10; for the variation of specific gravity may be considered as the 100th part of the whole difference, in the same manner as 17.7 would have been had water and alcohol sustained no contraction.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> is greatly assisted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of geometrical quantity by exhibiting it in its own form. Specific gravity, being an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of density (a notion purely geometrical), admits of this illustration.\n\nTherefore let AB (fig. 2) represent the bulk of any mixture of water and alcohol. The specific gravity of water may be represented by a line of such a length, that AB shall be the difference between the gravities of alcohol and water. Suppose it extended upwards, towards a, till B a is to A a as 10,000 to 8250. It will suit our purpose better to represent it by a parallelogram a BF e, of any breadth BF. In this case the difference of the specific gravities of alcohol and water will be expressed by the parallelogram ABFE. If there were no change produced in the density of one or both ingredients, the specific gravity of the compound would increase as this parallelogram does, and AGHE would be the augmentation corresponding to the mixture of the quantity AG of alcohol with the quantity GB of water, and so of other mixtures. But, to express the augmentation of density as it really obtains, we must do it by some curvilinear area DABCHD, which varies at the rate determined by Sir Charles Blagden's experiments. This area must be precisely equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> ABFE. It must therefore fall without it in some places, and be deficient in others. Let DMHKC be the curve which corresponds with these experiments. It is evident to the mathematical reader, that the ordinates LM, GH, IK, &c. of this curve are in the ultimate ratio of the differences of the observed specific gravities. If A a, b b, &c. are each = s, the little spaces a a b b, &c. will be precisely equal to the differences of the specific gravities 0.8250; 0.8387; 0.8516; &c. corresponding to the different mixtures of water and alcohol. The curve cuts the side of the parallelogram in K, where the ordinate GK expresses the mean variation of density 0.0017.5. IK is the smallest variation. The condensation may be expressed by drawing a curve dmGfk parallel to DMGKF, making Dd = AE. The condensation is now represented by the spaces comprehended between this last curve and the abscissa AGB, reckoning those negative which lie on the other side of it. This shows, not only that the condensation is greatest in the mixture AG \u00d7 GB, but also that in mixing such a compound with another AI \u00d7 IB, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>. Another curve ANOPB may be drawn, of which the ordinates LN, GP, IO, &c. are proportional to the areas ALmd, AGmD, AIkGmd (=AGmd\u2014GIk), &c. This curve shows the whole condensation.\n\nThis manner of representing the specific gravities of mixtures will suggest many curious inferences to such as will consider them in the manner of Bozovich, with a view to ascertain the nature of the forces of cohesion and chemical affinities: And this manner of viewing the subject becomes every day more promising, in consequence of our improvements in chemical knowledge; for we now see, that mechanism, or motive forces, are the causes of chemical action. We see in almost every case, that chemical affinities are comparable with mechanical prejudices; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of a liquid into a vapour or gas is prevented by atmospheric pressure, and produced by the great chemical agent heat. The action of heat, therefore, or of the cause of heat, is a mechanical action, and the forces are common mechanical forces, with which we are familiarly acquainted.\n\n\"It may be also remarked in the column of contractions, that in the beginning the contractions augment nearly in the proportion of the quantity of spirits (but more slowly); whereas, in the end, the contractions are nearly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> proportion of the quantity of water. This circumstance deserves the consideration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. We have represented it to the eye by the curve n g h d.\"\n\nWe should here take some notice of the attempt made to elude some part of the duties, by adding some ingredient to the spirits. But our information on this subject is not very exact; and besides it would be doing no service to the trader to put fraud more in his power. There are some facts which make a very great augmentation of density, but they render the liquor unpalatable. Sugar is frequently used with this view; 16 grains of refined sugar dissolved in 1000 grains of proof spirits gave it no fuliginous taste, and increased its specific gravity from 0.920 to 0.925, which is a very great change, equivalent to the addition of 9 grains of water to a mixture of 100 grains of alcohol and 80 of water.","sp":208,"ep":218},{"h":"SPITHEAD","t":"a road between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a> and the Isle of Wight, where the royal navy of Great Britain frequently rendezvous.","sp":218,"ep":218},{"h":"SPLACHNUM","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the class of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYPTOGAMIA\">cryptogamia</a>, and order of musci.

It is remedied by a decree to account for the profits so taken. This injury, when the jus patronatus, or right of advowson, doth not come in debate, is cognizable in the spiritual court; as if a patron first presents A to a benefice, who is instituted and inducted thereto; and then, upon pretence of a vacancy, the same patron presents B to the same living, and he also obtains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>.

Mr Eliotwood, in the year 1762, was at great pains to discover these animals. For this purpose he dissected the sponge urens, and was surprised to find a great number of small worms of the genus of nemertes or sea colopendra, which had pierced their way through the soft substance of the sponge in quest of a safe retreat. That this was really the case, he was fully assured of, by inspecting a number of specimens of the same sort of sponge, just fresh from the sea. He put them into a glass filled with seawater; and then, instead of seeing any of the little animals which Dr Peyronell described, he observed the papillae or small holes with which the papillae are surrounded contract and dilate themselves. He examined another variety of the same species of sponge, and plainly perceived the small tubes inspire and expire the water. He therefore concluded, that the sponge is an animal, and that the ends or openings of the branched tubes are the mouths by which it receives its nourishment, and discharges its excrements.","sp":219,"ep":219},{"h":"SPONSORS","t":"among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, are those persons who, in the office of baptism, answer or are sureties for the persons baptized.","sp":219,"ep":219},{"h":"SPONTANEOUS","t":"a term applied to such motions of the body and operations of the mind as we perform ourselves without any contrivance.\n\nSPOON-BILL.

It was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s opinion, and held by most of the ancient philosophers after him, that the air contained in the caverns of the earth, being condensed by cold near its surface, was thereby changed into water; and that it made its way through, where it could find a passage. But we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of any such transmutation of air into water.\n\nThose who imagine that fountains owe their origin to waters brought from the sea by subterraneous ducts, give a tolerable account how they lose their saltness by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PERCOLATION\">percolation</a> as they pass through the earth; but they find great difficulty in explaining by what power the water rises above the level of the sea to near the tops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, where springs generally abound; it being contrary to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>, that a fluid should rise in a tube above the level of its source. However, they have found two ways whereby they endeavour to extricate themselves from this difficulty. The one is that of Des Cartes, who imagines, that after the water is become fresh by percolation, it is raised out of the caverns of the earth in vapour towards its surface; where meeting with rocks near the tops of mountains in the form of arches or vaults, it sticks to them, and runs down their sides, (like water in an alembic), till it meets with proper receptacles, from which it supplies the fountains. Now this is a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, without foundation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>: for, in the first place, we know of no internal heat of the earth to cause such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>; or if that were allowed, yet it is quite incredible that there should be any caverns so smooth and void of protuberances as to anwer the ends of an alembic, in collecting and condensing the vapours together in every place where fountains arise. There are others (as Varenius, &c.) who suppose that the water may rise through the pores of the earth, as through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>. But hereby they show, that they are quite unacquainted with what relates to the motion of a fluid through such tubes: for when a capillary tube opens into a cavity at its upper end, or grows larger and larger, so as to cease to be capillary at that end, the water will not ascend through that tube into the cavity, or beyond where the tube is capillary; because that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of the cavity, which is partly above the surface of the water and partly below it, is not of the capillary kind. Nay, if the cavity is continually supplied with water, it will be attracted into the capillary tube, and run down it as through a funnel, if the lower end is immersed in the same fluid, as in this case it is supposed to be.\n\nIt has been a generally received opinion, and much espoused by Mariotte (a diligent observer of nature), that the rise of springs is owing to the rains and melted snow. According to him, the rain-water which falls upon the hills and mountains, penetrating the surface,\nmeets with clay or rocks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to each other; along which it runs, without being able to penetrate them, till, being got to the bottom of the mountain, or to a considerable distance from the top, it breaks out of the ground, and forms springs.\n\nIn order to examine this opinion, Mr Perrault, De la Hire, and D. Sideleau, endeavoured to make an estimate of the quantity of rain and snow that falls in the space of a year, to see whether it would be sufficient to afford a quantity of water equal to that which is annually discharged into the sea by the rivers. The result of their inquiries was, that the quantity of rain and snow which fell in a year into a cylindrical vessel would fill it (if secured from evaporating) to the height of about nineteen inches. Which quantity D. Sideleau showed, was not sufficient to supply the rivers; for that those of England, Ireland, and Spain, discharge a greater quantity of water annually, than the rain, according to that experiment, is able to supply. Besides which, another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> was made by them at the same time, viz. that the quantity of water raised in vapour, one year with another, amounted to about thirty-two inches, which is thirteen more than falls in rain: a plain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> that the water of fountains is not supplied by rain and melted snow.\n\nThus the true cause of the origin of fountains remained undiscovered, till Dr Halley, in making his celestial observations upon the tops of the mountains at St Helena, about 800 yards above the level of the sea, found, that the quantity of vapour which fell there (even when the sky was clear) was so great, that it very much impeded his observations, by covering his glasses with water every half quarter of an hour; and upon that he attempted to determine by experiment the quantity of vapour exhaled from the surface of the sea, as far as it rises from heat, in order to try whether that might be a sufficient supply for the water continually discharged by fountains. The proofs of his experiment was as follows: He took a vessel of water salted to the same degree with that of sea water, in which he placed a thermometer; and by means of a pan of coals brought the water to the same degree of heat, which is observed to be that of the air in our hottest summer; this done, he fixed the vessel of water with the thermometer in it to one end of a pair of scales, and exactly counterpoised it with weights on the other: then, at the end of two hours, he found, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> made in the weight of the vessel, that about a sixtieth part of an inch of the depth of the water was gone off in vapour; and therefore, in twelve hours, one tenth of an inch would have gone off. Now this accurate observer allows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> sea to be forty degrees long; and four broad, (the broader parts compensating for the narrower, so that its whole surface is 160 square degrees); which, according to the experiment, must yield at least 5,280,000,000 tons of water: In which account no regard is had to the wind and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the surface of the sea, both which undoubtedly promote the evaporation.\n\nIt remained now to compare this quantity of water with that which is daily conveyed into the same sea by the rivers. The only way to do which was to compare them with some known river; and accordingly he takes his computation from the river Thames; and, to avoid all objections, makes allowances, probably greater than what were absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Mediterranean receives the following considerable rivers, viz. the Iberus, the Rhone, the Tyber, the Po, the Danube, the Niefer, the Borythenses, the Tana\u00efs, and the Nile. Each of these he supposes to bring down ten times as much water as the Thames, whereby he allows for smaller rivers which fall into the same sea. The Thames, then, he finds by measurement to discharge about 20,300,000 tons of water a day. If therefore the above-laid nine rivers yield ten times as much water as the Thames doth, it will follow, that all of them together yield but 1827 millions of tons in a day, which is but little more than one-third of what is proved to be raised in vapour out of the Mediterranean in the same time. We have therefore from hence a source abundantly sufficient for the supply of fountains.\n\nNow having found that the vapour exhaled from the sea is a sufficient supply for the fountains, he proceeds in the next place to consider the manner in which they are raised; and how they are condensed into water again, and conveyed to the sources of springs.\n\nIn order to this he considers, that if an atom of water was expanded into a shell or bubble, so as to be ten times as big in diameter as when it was water, that atom would become specifically lighter than air; and therefore would rise so long as the warmth which first separated it from the surface of the water should continue to distend it to the same degree; and consequently, that vapours may be raised from the surface of the sea in that manner, till they arrive at a certain height in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, at which they find air of equal specific gravity with themselves. Here they will float till, being condensed by cold, they become specifically heavier than the air, and fall down in dew; or being driven by the winds against the sides of mountains (many of which far surpass the usual height to which the vapours would of themselves ascend), are compelled by the stream of the air to mount up with it to the tops of them; where being condensed into water, they presently precipitate, and gleaming down by the crannies of the stones, part of them enters into the caverns of the hills; which being once filled, all the overplus of water that comes thither runs over by the lowest place, and breaking out by the sides of the hills forms single springs. Many of these running down by the valleys between the ridges of the hills, and coming to unite, form little rivulets or brooks; many of these again meeting in one common valley, and gaining the plain ground, being grown less rapid, become a river; and many of these being united in one common channel, make such streams as the Rhine and the Danube; which latter, he observes, one would hardly think to be a collection of water condensed out of vapour, unless we consider how vast a tract of ground that river drains, and that it is the sum of all those springs which break out on the south side of the Carpathian mountains, and on the north side of the immense ridge of the Alps, which is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> chain of mountains from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black sea</a>.\n\nThus one part of the vapours which are blown on the land is returned by the rivers into the sea from whence it came. Another part falls into the sea before it reaches the land; and this is the reason why the rivers do not return so much water into the Mediterranea.\nnean as is raised in vapour. A third part falls on the low lands, where it affords nourishment to plants; yet it does not rest there, but is again exhaled in vapour by the action of the sun, and is either carried by the winds to the sea to fall in rain or dew there, or else to the mountains to become the sources of springs.\n\nHowever, it is not to be supposed that all fountains are owing to one and the same cause; but that some proceed from rain and melted snow, which, subsiding through the surface of the earth, makes its way into certain cavities, and thence issues out in the form of springs; because the waters of several are found to increase and diminish in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the rain which falls; that others again, especially such as are salt, and spring near the sea-shore, owe their origin to sea-water percolated through the earth; and some to both these causes: though without doubt most of them, and especially such as spring near the tops of high mountains, receive their waters from vapours, as before explained.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> of Dr Halley's is confirmed by more recent observations and discoveries. It is now found, that though water is a tolerable conductor of the electric fluid, dry earth is an electric per se, consequently the dry land must always be in an electrified state compared with the ocean, unless in such particular cases as are mentioned under the article EARTHQUAKE, No 82. It is also well known, that such bodies as are in an electrified state, whether plus or minus, will attract vapour, or other light substances that come near them. Hence the vapours that are raised from the ocean must necessarily have a tendency to approach the land in great quantity, even without the assistance of the wind, though this last must undoubtedly contribute greatly towards the same purpose, as Dr Halley justly observes. In like manner, the higher grounds are always in a more electrified state than the lower ones: and hence the vapours having once left the ocean and approached the shore, are attracted by the high mountains; of which Mr Pennant gives an instance in Snowdon. Hence we may see the reason why springs are so common in the neighbourhood of mountains, they being so advantageously formed in every respect for collecting and condensing the vapours into water.\n\nThe heat of springs is generally the same with the mean temperature of the atmosphere. The mean temperature of the south of England is 48\u00b0; in Scotland, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, it is 45\u00b0; in the north of Ireland it is 48\u00b0, and on the south coast about 51\u00b0. At Upsal, in Sweden, it is 43\u00b0, and in Paris 53\u00b0. According to accurate experiments made by eminent philosophers, the heat of the springs in these different countries corresponds with the medium temperature. We have not heard that similar experiments have been made in other countries, or we should have been careful to collect them. We do not, however, doubt but they have been made in most countries of Europe; yet we suspect little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> has been paid to this subject within the tropical regions.\n\nThough this coincidence of the heat of springs with the mean temperature of the climate where they flow, seems to be a general fact, yet it admits of many exceptions. In many parts of the world there are springs which not only exceed the mean temperature, but even the strongest meridian heat ever known in the torrid regions. The following table will give a distinct notion of the degrees of heat which different springs have been found to possess, according to the experiments of philosophers. It is necessary to remark, that experiments made upon the same springs, made by different persons, vary a little from one another, which may be owing to many accidents easily accounted for. Where this is the case, we shall mention both the lowest and highest degree of heat which has been ascribed to the same spring, according to Fahrenheit's thermometer.\n\n| Places          | Springs                  | Highest degree of heat | Lowest degree of heat |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Bristol         | St Vincent's or the hot well | 84                     | 76                   |\n| Buxton          | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s bath         | 82                     |                      |\n| Matlock         |                          | 69                     |                      |\n| Bath            | King's bath              | 119                    | 113                  |\n| Aix-la-Chapelle |                          | 146                    | 136                  |\n| Barege          |                          | 122                    |                      |\n| Pifa            | Caroline baths in Prudel or furioso | 104                |                      |\n| Bohemia         |                          | 165                    |                      |\n| Iceland         | Geyser                   | 212                    |                      |\n\nIn cold countries, where congelation takes place, the heat of the earth is considerably above the freezing point, and continues so through the whole year. From experiments that have been made in mines and deep pits, it appears that this heat is uniform and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> at a certain depth. But as the heat of these springs far exceeds the common heat of the internal parts of the earth, it must be occasioned by causes peculiar to certain places; but what these causes are it is no easy matter to determine. We are certain, indeed, that hot springs receive their heat from some subterranean cause; but it is a matter of difficulty to investigate how this heat is produced and preserved. Theories, however, have been formed on this subject. The subterranean heat has been ascribed to the electrical fluid, and to a great body of fire in the centre of the earth: But we suspect that the nature of the electrical fluid and its effects are not sufficiently understood. As to the supposition that the heat of springs is owing to a central fire, it is too hypothetical to require any refutation. From what then does this heat originate, and whence is the fuel which has produced it for so many ages? To enable us to answer these questions with precision, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> is necessary than we have hitherto obtained respecting the structure of the internal parts of the earth. It is peculiarly requisite that we should be made acquainted with the fossils which are most common in those places where hot springs abound. We should then perhaps discover that hot springs always pass through bodies of a combustible nature. It is well known to chemists, that when water is mixed with the vitriolic acid, a degree of heat is produced superior to that of boiling water. It is also an established fact, that when water meets with pyrites, that is, a mixture of sulphur and iron, a violent inflammation takes place. If, therefore, we could prove that these materials exist in the strata from which hot springs are derived, we should be enabled to give a satisfactory account of this curious phenomenon. As some apology for this supposition, we may add, that most of the hot springs mentioned above have been found by analysis to be impregnated with sulphur, and some of them with iron.\nIt must, however, be acknowledged, that the hot springs of Iceland, which are 212\u00b0, the heat of boiling water, according to an accurate analysis of their contents by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Dr Black, were neither found to contain iron nor sulphur. It will therefore, perhaps, be necessary that we should wait with patience, and continue to collect facts, till the sciences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINERALOGY\">mineralogy</a> shall be so far advanced as to enable us to form a permanent theory on this subject.\n\nSprings are of different kinds. Some are perennial, or continue to flow during the whole year; others flow only during the rainy season; some ebb and flow. At Torbay there is one of this kind, which ebbs and flows five or six inches every hour. There is another near Corf\u00f9 in Italy, which ebbed and flowed three times a day in the time of Pliny, and continues to do so still. A spring near Henly sometimes flows for two years together, and then dries up for an equal period.

This problem however has not been, and probably cannot be, strictly resolved by the commonly admitted principles of geometry; mathematicians having hitherto been unable to do more than to find a square that shall differ from the area of any proposed circle by as small a quantity as they please. The quadrature of the circle is a problem of the same degree of difficulty, and indeed may be regarded as identical with another geometrical problem, namely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTIFICATION\">Rectification</a> of the circle, or the finding a straight line equal to its circumference; for the area of a circle is equal to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> contained by the radius and a straight line equal to half the circumference (Geometry, Sect. VI. Prop. 3.) therefore, if a straight line exactly equal to the circumference could be found, a rectilineal space precisely equal to the area might also be found, and the contrary. But although no perfectly accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of the problem has been obtained under either form, we can always find approximate values of the area and circumference; and therefore it is now customary to apply the terms quadrature and rectification of the circle also to these.\n\nThe problem of the quadrature of the circle appears to have engaged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of geometers at a very early period; for we are told that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a>, who lived about 500 years before Christ, attempted its solution while confined in prison on account of his philosophical opinions. We are ignorant of the result of his researches; but although we cannot suppose they were attended with any success, we may reasonably conclude that we are indebted to them for the discovery of some of the properties of the figure, which are now known as elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> in geometry.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> of Chios was likewise engaged in trying to resolve the same problem, and it was no doubt in the course of his inquiries into this subject that he discovered the quadrature of the curvilinear space, which is now known by the name of the Lune of Hippocrates. The nature of this discovery may be briefly explained as follows. Let ABCD be a circle (Plate D. fig. 1.), H its centre, AC its diameter, ADC a triangle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, having its sides AD, DC equal to one another. On D as a centre, with DA or DC as a radius, let the quadrant arch AEC be described, then shall the curvilinear space bounded by the semicircle ABC and the quadrant arch AEC (which is the Lune of Hippocrates) be equal to the rectilineal triangle ADC. For because circles are to one another as the squares of the radii (Geometry, Sect. VI. Prop. 4.) the circle having DA for its radius will be to the circle having HA for its radius as the square of DA to the square of HA, that is, as 2 to 1; hence the former of these circles will be double the latter, and consequently one fourth of the former will be equal to one half of the latter; that is, the quadrant AEC will be equal to the semicircle ABC; from these equals take away the common space bounded by the diameter AC and the arch AEC, and there will remain the triangle ADC equal to the luneal space AECBA.\n\nAlthough Hippocrates's discovery has led to no important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> either relating to the quadrature of the circle or that of any other curve, yet at the time it was made it might be regarded as of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, chiefly because it showed the possibility of exhibiting a rectilineal figure equal to a space bounded by curved lines, a thing which we have reason to suppose was then done for the first time, and might have been fairly doubted, considering the insuperable difficulty that was found to attend the quadrature of the circle or its rectification.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> speaks of two persons, viz. Bryson and Antiphon, who about his time, or a little earlier, were occupied with the quadrature of the circle. The former appears, according to the testimony of Alexander Apollonius, to have erred most egregiously; he having concluded that the circumference was exactly 3\\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) times the diameter. And the latter seems to have proceeded pretty much in the same manner as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> afterwards did in squaring the parabola, that is, by first inscribing a square in the circle, then an inscribed triangle in each of the segments of the curve, having for its base a side of the square; and next again a series of triangles in the segments, having for their bases the sides of the former series, and so on: this mode of procedure however, could not be attended with any success, as it is well known that the spaces thus formed do not, as in the case of the parabola, admit of being absolutely summed.\n\nIt may naturally be supposed that Archimedes exerted his utmost efforts to resolve this problem; and probably it was only after long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITATION\">meditation</a> on the subject that he lost all hopes of success, and contented himself with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to the ratio of the diameter to the circumference which is contained in his treatise De Circuli Dimensione, which has been preserved from the period in which he wrote, about 250 years before Christ, to the present times. He found his approximation to the ratio, by supposing a regular polygon of 96 sides to be described about the circle, and another of the same number of sides to be inscribed in it, and by showing that the perimeter of the circumscribing polygon was less than \\(3\\frac{1}{7}\\), or \\(3\\frac{1}{7}\\) times the diameter, but that the perimeter of the inscribed figure was greater than \\(3\\frac{1}{7}\\) times the\nSquaring the diameter; now the circumference of the circle being 1/6 than the perimeter of the one polygon but greater than that of the other, it follows that the circumference must be less than \\(3\\frac{1}{7}\\) times the diameter, but greater than \\(3\\frac{4}{7}\\) times; so that, taking the first of these limits as being expressed by the smallest numbers, the circumference will be to the diameter as \\(3\\frac{1}{7}\\) to 1, or as 22 to 7 nearly.\n\nAlthough the approximate ratio investigated by Archimedes be the oldest known to have been found in the western world, yet one more accurate seems to have been known at a much earlier period in India. This we learn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTES\">Institutes</a> of Akbar (Ayeen Akberry) where it is said that the Hindoos suppose the diameter of a circle to be to its circumference as 1250 to 3927. Now this ratio, which is the same as that of 1 to 3.1416, when found in the simplest and most elementary manner must have required the inscription of a polygon of 768 sides in the circle, and must have been attended with nine extractions of the square root, each carried as far as ten places of figures.\n\nWe learn from Simplicius that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOMEDES\">Nicomedes</a> and Apollonius both attempted to square the circle, the former by means of a curve which he called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRATRIX\">Quadratrix</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of which, however, is ascribed to Dinostratus, and the latter also by the help of a curve denominated the slitter to the tortuous line or spiral, and which was probably no other than the quadratrix of Dinostratus; the nature of which, and the manner of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the subject in question, we shall briefly explain.\n\nLet AFB be a quadrant of a circle (fig. 2.) and C its centre; and conceive the radius CF to revolve uniformly about C from the position CA until at last it coincide with CB; while at the same time a line DG is carried with an uniform motion from A towards CB; the former line continuing always parallel to the latter, until at last they coincide; both motions being supposed to begin and end at the same instant. Then the point E in which the revolving radius CF and the moveable line DG intersect one another will generate a certain curve line AEH, which is the Quadratrix of Dinostratus.\n\nDraw EK, FL both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to CB; then because the radius AC and the quadrant arch AFB are uniformly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the same time by the points D and F, the contemporaneous spaces described will have to one another the same ratio as the whole spaces; that is, AD : AF :: AC : AB; hence we have AC : AB :: DC, or EK : FB. Now as the moveable point F approaches to B, the ratio of the straight line EK to the arch FB will approach to, and will manifestly be ultimately the same as the ratio of the straight line EK to the straight line FL, which again is equal to the ratio of CE to CF; therefore the ratio of the radius AC to the quadrant arch AFB is the limit of the ratio of CE to CF, and consequently equal to the ratio of CH to CB, H being the point in which the quadratrix meets CB. Since therefore CH : CB :: CA or CB : quad. arch AFB, if by any means we could determine the point H, we might then find a straight line equal to the quadrant arch, (by finding a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to CH and CB) and consequently a straight line equal to the circumference. The point H, however, cannot be determined by a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, and therefore all the ingenuity evinced by the person who first thought of this method of rectifying the circle (which certainly is considerable) has been unavailing.\n\nThe Arabs, who succeeded the Greeks in the cultivation of the sciences, would no doubt have their pretended squarers of the circle. We however know nothing more than that some one of them believed he had discovered that the diameter being unity, the circumference was the square root of 10; a very gross mistake; for the square root of 10 exceeds 3.162; but Archimedes had demonstrated that the circumference was less than 3.143.\n\nIt appears that, even during the dark ages, some attempts were made at the solution of this famous problem, which however have always remained in manuscripts buried in the dust of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>. But upon the revival of learning the problem was again agitated by different writers, and particularly by the celebrated Cardinal De Cufa, who distinguished himself by his unfortunate attempt to resolve it. His mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, which had no solid foundation in geometry, led him to conclude, that if a line equal to the sum of the radius of a circle and the side of its inscribed square were made the diameter of another circle, and an equilateral triangle were inscribed in this last, the perimeter of this triangle would be equal to the circumference of the other circle. This pretended quadrature of the cardinal's was refuted by Regiomontanus; and indeed the task was not difficult; for, according to his construction, the diameter being 1, the circumference was greater than \\(3\\frac{1}{7}\\); a conclusion which must be absurd, seeing that Archimedes had demonstrated that it must be less than that number.\n\nIt would be trespassing too much upon the patience of our readers, were we to mention all the absurd and erroneous attempts which have been made during the last three centuries to square the circle. In a supplement to Montucla's excellent work, Histoire des Mathematiques, we find upwards of forty pretenders to the honour of this discovery enumerated. These were almost all very ignorant of geometry; and many of them were wild visionaries, pretending to discover inexplicable relations between the plain truths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> and the most mysterious doctrines of religion. If those who have sought the quadrature of the circle had been previously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a> in the doctrines of geometry, although they missed attaining the object they had in view, yet they could not have failed to have extended the boundaries of the science by the discovery of many new propositions. From such persons, however, as have generally pursued this inquiry, no improvement whatever of the science was to be expected; although, indeed, in some instances, it has derived advantage from the labours of such as have undertaken to expose the absurdity of their conclusions; as in the case of Metius, who in refuting the quadrature of one Simon \u00e0 Picquet, found a much nearer approximation to the ratio of the diameter to the circumference than had been previously known, at least in Europe, viz., that of 113 to 355, which reduced to decimals is the same as the ratio of 1 to 3.1415929, differing from the truth only in the seventh place of decimals.\n\nAmong the most remarkable of those who have recorded their own folly by publishing erroneous resolutions of the problem, we may reckon the celebrated Joseph Scaliger. Full of self-conceit, he believed that, enterings,\nSquaring. tering upon the study of geometry, he could not fail to surmount by the force of his genius those obstacles which had completely foiled the progress of all preceding inquirers. He gave the result of his meditations to the world in 1592, under the title Nova Cyclomeria; but he was refuted by Clavius, by Vieta, and others, who showed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> he had assigned to the circumference was a little less than the perimeter of the inscribed polygon of 192 sides, which proved beyond a doubt that he was wrong. Scaliger, however, was not to be convinced of the absurdity of his conclusion; and indeed, in almost every instance, pretenders to this discovery have not been more remarkable for their folly in committing absurd blunders, than for their obstinacy in maintaining that they were in the right, and all who held a contrary opinion in an error.\n\nThe famous Hobbes came also upon the field about the year 1650, with pretensions not only to the quadrature of the circle, but also to the trisection of an angle, the rectification of the parabola, &c.; but his pretended solutions were refuted by Dr Wallis. And this circumstance afforded him occasion to write not only against geometers, but even against the science of geometry itself.\n\nWe find it recorded by Montucla, as a sort of phenomenon, that one Richard White, an English Jesuit, having happened upon what he conceived to be a quadrature of the circle, which he published under the title, Chrysa\u00ebpsis seu Quadratura Circuli, suffered himself at last to be convinced by some of his friends that he was wrong both in his quadrature of the circle, and in his rectification of the spiral. But a solution of the same problem found out by one Mathulen of Lyons, did not produce in the end so much advantage to its author. This man in 1728 announced to the learned world that he had discovered both the quadrature of the circle and a perpetual motion; and he was so certain of the truth of these discoveries, that he consigned 1000 ecus (about 125l.) to be paid to any one who should demonstrate that he was deceived in either. The task was not difficult. Nicole of the Academy of Sciences demonstrated that he was wrong, and he himself allowed it; but he hesitated to pay the money, which Nicole had relinquished in favour of the H\u00f4tel Dieu of Lyons. The affair went before a court of justice, which adjudged the money to be paid, as Nicole had defined it, to the poor. At a later period, viz. in 1753, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> de Caufans, a French officer, and a man who was never expected to be a mathematician, suddenly found a quadrature of the circle in procuring a circular piece of turf to be cut; and rising from one truth to another, he explained by his quadrature the doctrine of original sin, and the Trinity. He engaged himself by a public writing to deposit with a notary the sum of 300,000 francs, to be wagered against such as should oppose him, and he actually lodged 10,000, which were to devolve to him who should demonstrate his error. This was easily done, as it resulted from his discovery that a circle was equal to its circumference square, that is, a part to the whole! Some persons came forward to answer his challenge, and in particular a young lady sued him at one of the courts of law; but the French king judged that the Chevalier's fortune ought not to suffer on account of his whim; for, setting aside this piece of folly, in every other respect he was a worthy man. The procedure was therefore foiled, and the wager declared void.\n\nWe shall not enter farther into the history of these vain and absurd attempts to resolve this important problem, but proceed to state what has actually been done by men of sound minds and real mathematical acquirements towards its solution. And in the first place it may be observed that the problem admits of being propounded under two different forms: for it may be required to find either the area of the whole circle, or, which is the same thing, the length of the whole circumference; or else to find the area of any proposed sector or segment, or, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, the length of the arch of the sector or segment. The former is termed the definite and the latter the indefinite quadrature of the circle. The latter evidently is more general than the former, and includes it as a particular case. Now if we could find by any means a finite algebraic equation that should express the relation between any proposed arch of a circle, and some known straight line, or lines, the magnitude of one or more of which depended on that arch, then we would have an absolute rectification of the arch, and consequently a rectification or quadrature also of the whole circle. We here speak of an analytical solution of the problem; the ancients, however, who were almost entirely ignorant of this branch of mathematical science, must have endeavoured to treat it entirely upon geometrical principles. It is now well known, however, that all geometrical problems may be subjected to analysis; and that it is only by such a mode of proceeding they have in many cases been resolved.\n\nWith respect to the definite quadrature of the circle, it is commonly understood that no unexceptionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of its impossibility has hitherto been published. It is true that James Gregory, in his vera circuli et Hyperbolae quadratura, has given what he considered as such a demonstration; but it has been objected to, particularly by Huygens, one of the best geometers of his time. We are, however, certain that the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, as also, that the ratio of the square of the diameter to the square of a straight line equal to the circumference, cannot be expressed by rational numbers, for this has been strictly demonstrated by Lambert, in the Berlin Memoirs for 1761. A demonstration is also given in Legendre's Geometrie. As to the indefinite quadrature, if Newton's demonstration of the 28th lemma of the first book of his Principia be correct, the thing ought to be absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. For the object of that proposition is to prove that in no oval figure whatever, that returns into itself, can the area cut off by straight lines at pleasure be universally found by an equation of a finite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, and composed of a finite number of terms. If this be true, then it will be impossible to express any sector of a circle taken at pleasure in finite terms. It is however to be remarked, that the accuracy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> by which Newton has attempted to establish the truth of the general proposition has been questioned by no less a geometer than D'Alembert; and indeed we know one oval curve, which returns into itself, and which according to Newton's proposition ought therefore not to admit of an indefinite quadrature; yet this is by no means the case, for it does really admit of such a quadrature. The curve we mean is the lemniscata, the equation of which is \\((x^2+y^2)^2=ax(x^2-y^2)\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) denote its coordinates.\nsquaring ordinates, and \\(a\\) is put for a given line. The figure of the curve is nearly that of the numeral character 8. Upon the whole then we may infer that an unexceptionable demonstration of the impossibility of expressing either the whole circle, or any propoed factor of it, by a finite equation, is still among the desiderata of mathematics.\n\nWe come now to speak of the different methods which have been found for approximating to the area or the circumference. We have already noticed the approximation to the ratio of the diameter to the circumference found by Archimedes, and the earlier and more accurate approximation of the Indian mathematicians. Archimedes' ratio is the only one found by the ancients in the western world that has descended to modern times, and it appears to have been the most accurate known, until about the year 1535, when Metius, in refuting a pretended quadrature, found the more accurate ratio of \\(\\frac{11}{7}\\) to \\(\\frac{355}{113}\\), as we have already noticed. About the same time Vieta, and Adrianus Romanus published their ratios expressed in decimals, the former carrying the approximation to ten decimals instead of six, (which was the number of accurate figures expressed by Metius's ratio), and the latter extending it to 17 figures. Vieta also gave a kind of series, which being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to infinity, gave the value of the circle.\n\nThese approximations, however, were far exceeded by that of Ludolph Van Ceulen, who in a work published in Dutch in 1610, carried it as far as 36 figures, showing that if the diameter were unity, the circumference would be greater than \\(3.141592653589793\\ldots\\), but less than the same number with the last figure increased by an unit. This work was translated into Latin by Snellius, and published under the title, *De Circulo et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">Hyperbola</a> Quadratura*. In finding this approximation, Van Ceulen followed the method of Archimedes, doubling continually the number of sides of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons, until at length he found two which differed only by an unit in the 36th place of decimals in the numbers expressing their perimeters. This, however, must have been rather a work of patience than of genius; and indeed the labour must have been prodigious. He seems to have valued highly this singular effort, for in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of Archimedes, whose tomb was adorned with a sphere and cylinder, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMEMORATION\">commemoration</a> of his discovery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> which these solids bear to one another, he requested that the ratio he had found might be inscribed on his tomb, which was accordingly done.","sp":223,"ep":229},{"h":"STAFF","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> ordinarily used to rest on in walking.

It was visited by Sir Joseph Banks, who communicated the following account of it to Mr Pennant.\n\n\"The little island of Staffa lies on the west coast of Mull, about three leagues north-east from Iona, or Icolmkill: its greatest length is about an English mile, and its breadth about half a one. On the east side of the island is a small bay where boats generally land; a little to the southward of which the first appearance of pillaris is to be observed; they are small; and instead of being placed upright, lie down on their sides, each forming a segment of a circle. From thence you pass a small cave, above which the pillars, now grown a little larger, are inclining in all directions: in one place in particular, a small mass of them very much resembles the ribs of a ship. From hence having passed the cave, which, if it is not low-water, you must do in a boat, you come to the first range of pillars, which are still not above half as large as those a little beyond. Over against this place is a small island, called in Esse Boo-fha-la, separated from the main by a channel not many fathoms wide. This whole island is composed of pillars without any stratum above them; they are still small, but by much the nearest formed of any about the place.\n\n\"The first division of the island, for at high water it is divided into two, makes a kind of a cone, the pillars converging together towards the centre: on the other they are in general laid down flat: and in the front next to the main, you see how beautifully they are packed together, their ends coming out square with the bank which they form. All these have their transverse sections exact, and their surfaces smooth; which is by no means the case with the large ones, which are cracked in all directions. I must question, however, if any part of this whole island of Boo-fha-la is two feet in diameter.\n\n\"The main island opposite to Boo-fha-la, and farther towards the north-west, is supported by ranges of pillars pretty erect, and, though not tall (as they are not uncovered to the base), of large diameters; and at their feet is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> pavement, made by the upper sides of such as have been broken off, which extends as far under water as the eye can reach. Here the forms of the pillars are apparent; there are of three, four, five, six, and seven sides; but the numbers of five and six are by much the most prevalent. The largest I measured was of seven; it was four feet five inches in diameter.\n\n\"The surfaces of these large pillars, in general, are rough and uneven, full of cracks in all directions; the transverse figures in the upright ones never fail to run in their true directions. The surfaces upon which we walked were often flat, having neither concavity nor convexity; the larger number, however, was concave, though some were very evidently convex. In some places, the interstices within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> figures were filled up with a yellow spar: in one place, a vein passed in among the mass of pillars, carrying here and there small threads of spar. Though they were broken and cracked through in all directions, yet their perpendicular figures might easily be traced: from whence it is easy to infer, that whatever the accident might have been that caused the dillocation, it happened after the formation of the pillars.\n\n\"From hence proceeding along shore, you arrive at Fingal's cave.

As captain-general of the union, his serene highness had 120,000 guilders per annum; besides 24,000 from Friesland, and 12,000 from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRONINGEN\">Groningen</a>, in quality of captain-general of those provinces.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXCELLENCY\">excellency</a> of his lectures while he filled that chair, the importance of his various publications, and his extensive practice, soon raised his reputation to a very great height.

Stahl is without doubt one of the greatest men of which the annals of medicine can boast; his name marks the commencement of a new and more illustrious era in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>. He was the author of the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHLOGISTON\">phlogiston</a>, which, though now completely overturned by the discoveries of Lavoisier and others, was not without its use; as it served to combine the scattered fragments of former chemists into a system, and as it gave rise to more accurate experiments and a more scientific view of the subject, to which many of the subsequent discoveries were owing. This theory maintained its ground for more than half a century, and was received and supported by some of the most eminent men which Europe has produced; a sufficient proof of the ingenuity and the abilities of its author. He was the author also of A Theory of Medicine, founded upon the notions which he entertained of the absolute dominion of mind over body; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which, he affirmed, that every muscular action is a voluntary act of the mind, whether attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> or not.

On the outer joints of the fore-feet are several very sharp hooks for the easier catching and holding of their prey; while, with the other feet, which are four in number, they take hold of trees or any other thing, the better to surprise whatever they lie in wait for.

These imposts are very various; being higher or lower, not so much according to the value of the property transferred, as according to the nature of the deed. The highest do not exceed six pounds upon every sheet of paper or skin of parchment; and these high duties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown, and upon certain law proceedings, without any regard to the value of the subject. There are in Great Britain no duties on the registration of deeds or writings, except the fees of the officers who keep the register; and these are seldom more than a reasonable recompense for their labour. The crown derives no revenue from them.\n\nThe stamp-duties constitute a tax which, though in some instances it may be heavily felt, by greatly increasing the expense of all mercantile as well as legal proceedings, yet (if moderately imposed) is of service to the public in general, by authenticating instruments, and rendering it much more difficult than formerly to forge deeds of any standing; since, as the officers of this branch of the revenue vary their stamps frequently, by marks perceptible to none but themselves, a man that would forge a deed of King William's time, must know and be able to counterfeit the stamp of that date also. In France and some other countries the duty is laid on the contract itself, not on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in which it is contained; as, with us too in England (besides the stamps on the indentures), a tax is laid, by statute 8 Ann. c. 9, on every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a>-fee; of 6d. in the pound if it be sold or under, and 1s. in the pound if a greater sum: but this tends to draw the subject into a thousand nice difficulties and disputes concerning the nature of his contract, and whether taxable or not; in which the farmers of the revenue are sure to have the advantage. Our general method answers the purposes of the state as well, and consults the ease of the subject much better. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of the stamp duties was by statute 5 and 6 W. and M. c. 21, and they have since, in many instances, been increased to five times their original amount.","sp":239,"ep":239},{"h":"STANCHION","t":"or STANCHIONS, a sort of small pillars of wood or iron used for various purposes in a ship; as to support the decks, the quarter-rails, the nettings, the awnings, &c.

In 1728, and in 1745, he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENIPOTENTIARY\">plenipotentiary</a> to Holland; which high character he supported with the greatest dignity; serving his own country, and gaining the esteem of the states general. Upon his return from Holland, he was sent lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of Ireland; and during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> there, gave general satisfaction to all parties. He left Dublin in 1746, and in October succeeded the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARRINGTON\">Harrington</a> as secretary of state, in which post he officiated until February 6th 1748. Being seized with a deafness in 1732 that incapacitated him for the pleasures of society, he from that time led a private and retired life, amusing himself with books and his pen; in particular, he engaged largely as a volunteer in a periodical miscellaneous paper called *The World*, in which his contributions have a distinguished degree of excellence. He died in 1773, leaving a character for wit and abilities that had few equals. He distinguished himself by his eloquence in parliament on many important occasions; of which we have a characteristic instance, of his own relating. He was an active promoter of the bill for altering the style; on which occasion, as he himself writes in one of his letters to his son, he made so eloquent a speech in the house, that every one was pleased, and said he had made the whole very clear to them; \"when (says he), God knows, I had not even attempted it. I could just as soon have talked Celtic or Sclavonian to them, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>; and they would have understood me full as well.\" Lord Chesterfield, one of the greatest mathematicians in Europe, and who had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> hand in framing the bill, spoke afterwards, with all the clearness that a thorough knowledge of the subject could dictate; but not having a flow of words equal to Lord Chesterfield, the latter gained the applause from the former, to the equal credit of the speaker and the auditors. The high character Lord Chesterfield supported during life, received no small injury soon after his death, from a fuller display of it by his own hand. He left no issue by his lady, but had a natural son, Philip Stanhope, Esq., whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> was for many years a close object of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and who was afterward envoy extraordinary at the court of Dresden, but died before him. When Lord Chesterfield died, Mr Stanhope's widow published a course of letters, written by the father to the son, filled with instructions suitable to the different gradations of the young man's life to whom they were addressed. These letters contain many fine observations on mankind, and rules of conduct; but it is observable that he lays a greater stress on exterior accomplishments and address, than on intellectual qualifications and sincerity; and allows greater latitude to fashionable pleasures than good morals will justify, especially in paternal instructions. Hence it is that a celebrated writer, and of manners somewhat different from those of the polite earl of Chesterfield, is said to have observed of these letters, that \"they inculcate only the morals of a whore, with the manners of a dancing-master.\"\n\nDr John Stanhope, an eminent divine, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>, in the year 1660. His father was rector of that place, vicar of St Margaret's church in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>, and chaplain to the earls of Chesterfield and Clare. His grandfather, Dr George Stanhope, was chaplain to James I. and Charles I.; had the chancellorship of York, where he was also a canon-rectory, held a prebend, and was rector of Welldrake in that county. He was for his loyalty driven from his home with eleven children; and died in 1642. Our author was sent to school, first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UPPINGHAM\">Uppingham</a> in Rutland, then at Leicester; afterwards removed to Eaton; and thence chosen to King's college in Cambridge, in the place of W. Cleaver. He took the degree of B. A. in 1681; M. A. 1683; was elected one of the syndics for the university of Cambridge, in the bursaries of Alban Francis, 1687; minister of Quoi near Cambridge, and vice-proctor, 1688; was that year preferred to the rectory of Tring in Hertfordshire, which after some time he quitted. He was in 1689 presented to the vicarage of Lewisham in Kent by Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DARTMOUTH\">Dartmouth</a>, to whom he had been chaplain, and tutor to his son. He was also appointed chaplain to King William and Queen Mary, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to enjoy that honour under Queen Anne. He commenced D. D. July 5th 1697, performing all the offices required to that degree publicly and with great applause. He was made vicar of Deptford in 1703; succeeded Dr Hooper as dean of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a> the same year; and was thrice chosen prolocutor of the lower house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>. His uncommon diligence and industry, assisted by his excellent parts, enriched him with a large stock of polite, solid, and useful learning. His discourses from the pulpit were equally pleasing and profitable; a beautiful intermixture of the clearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> with the purest diction, attended with all the graces of a just elocution. The good Christian, the solid divine, and the fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, in him were happily united. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> was polite and delicate, grave without preciseness, facetious without levity. His piety was real and rational, his charity great and unselfish, fruitful in acts of mercy, and in all good works. He died March 18th 1728, aged 68 years; and was buried in the chancel of the church at Lewisham. The dean was twice married: first to Olivia Cotton, by whom he had one son and four daughters. His second lady, who was sister to Sir Charles Wager, survived him, dying October 11th 1732, aged about 54. One of the dean's daughters was married to a son of Bishop Burnet. Bishop Moore of Ely died the day before Queen Anne; who, it has been said, designed our dean for that see when it should become vacant. Dr Felton says, \"The late dean of Canterbury is excellent in the whole. His thoughts and reasoning are bright and solid. His style is just, both for the purity of the language and for the strength and beauty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>; but the periods are formed in so peculiar an order of the words, that it was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, nobody could pronounce them with the same grace and advantage as himself.\" His writings, which are an inestimable treasure of piety and devotion are, A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">Paraphrase</a> and Comment upon the Epistles and Gospels, 4 vols, 1753, 8vo.

His father was a Polish nobleman, distinguished by his rank and the important offices which he held, but still more by his firmness and courage. Stanislaus was sent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> in 1704 by the assembly of Warsaw to Charles XII. of Sweden, who had conquered Poland. He was at that time 27 years old, was general of Great Poland, and had been ambassador <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> to the Grand Signior in 1699. Charles was so delighted with the frankness and sincerity of his deportment, and with the firmness and sweetness which appeared in his countenance, that he offered him the crown of Poland, and ordered him to be crowned at Warsaw in 1705. He accompanied Charles XII. into Saxony, where a treaty was concluded with King Augustus in 1705, by which that prince resigned the crown, and acknowledged Stanislaus king of Poland. The new monarch remained in Saxony with Charles till 1707, when they returned into Poland and attacked the Russians, who were obliged to evacuate that kingdom in 1708. But Charles being defeated by Peter the Great in 1709, Augustus returned into Poland, and being assisted by a Russian army, obliged Stanislaus to retire first into Sweden, and afterwards into Turkey. Soon after he took up his residence at Weissenburg, a town in Alsace. Augustus dispatched him his envoy to France to complain of this; but the duke of Orl\u00e9ans, who was then regent, returned this answer: \"Tell your king, that France has always been the asylum of unhappy princes.\" Stanislaus lived in obscurity till 1725, when Louis XV. espoused the princess Mary his daughter. Upon the death of King Augustus in 1733, he returned to Poland in hopes of remounting the throne of that kingdom. A large party declared for him; but his competitor the young elector of Saxony, being supported by the emperor Charles VI. and the empress of Russia, was chosen king, though the majority was against him. Dantzig, to which Stanislaus had retired, was quickly taken, and the unfortunate prince made his escape in disguise with great difficulty, after hearing that a price was set upon his head by the Russians. When peace was concluded in 1736 between the emperor and France, it was agreed that Stanislaus should abdicate the throne, but that he should be acknowledged king of Poland and grand duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LITHUANIA\">Lithuania</a>, and continue to bear these titles during life; that all his effects and those of the queen his spouse should be restored; that an amnesty should be declared in Poland for all that was past, and that every person should be restored to his possessions, rights, and privileges: that the elector of Saxony should be acknowledged king of Poland by all the powers who acceded to the treaty; that Stanislaus should be put in peaceable possession of the duchies of Lorraine and Bar; but that immediately after his death these duchies should be united for ever to the crown of France. Stanislaus succeeded a race of Stanislaus princes in Lorraine, who were beloved and regretted; and his subjects found their ancient sovereigns revived in him. He took then the pleasure which he had so long desired, the pleasure of making men happy. He visited his new subjects; he embellished Nancy and Lun\u00e9ville; he made useful establishments; he founded colleges and built <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>. He was engaged in these noble employments, when an accident occasioned his death. His night-gown caught fire, and burnt him so severely before it could be extinguished, that he was seized with a fever, and died the 23rd of February 1766. His death occasioned a public mourning; the tears of his subjects indeed are the best eulogium upon this prince. In his youth he had accustomed himself to fatigue, and had thereby strengthened his mind as well as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. He lay always upon a kind of mattress, and seldom required any service from his domestics. He was temperate, liberal, adored by his vassals, and perhaps the only nobleman in Poland who had any friends. He was in Lorraine what he had been in his own country; gentle, affable, compassionate, treating his subjects like equals, participating their sorrows and alleviating their misfortunes. He resembled completely the picture of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> which he himself has drawn. \"The true philosopher (said he) ought to be free from prejudices, and to know the value of reason: he ought neither to think the higher ranks of life of more value than they are, nor to treat the lower orders of mankind with greater contempt than they deserve: he ought to enjoy pleasures without being a slave to them, riches without being attached to them, honours without pride or vanity: he ought to support disgraces without either fearing or courting them: he ought to reckon what he possesses sufficient for him, and to regard what he has not as useless: he ought to be equal in every fortune, always tranquil, always gay: he ought to love order, and to observe it in all his actions: he ought to be severe to himself, but indulgent to others: he ought to be frank and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> without rudeness, polite without falsehood, complacent without baseness: he ought to have the courage to disregard every kind of glory, and to reckon as nothing even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> itself.\" Such was Stanislaus in every situation. His temper was affectionate. He told his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> one day to put a certain officer on his list, to whom he was very much attached: \"In what quality (said the treasurer) shall I mark him down?\" \"As my friend\" (replied the monarch). A young painter conceiving hopes of making his fortune if his talents were made known to Stanislaus, presented him with a picture, which the courtiers criticised severely. The prince praised the performance, and paid the painter very generously: then turning to his courtiers, he said, \"Do ye not see, gentlemen, that this poor man must provide for his family by his abilities? if you discourage him by your censures, he is undone. We ought always to assist men; we never gain anything by hurting them.\" His revenues were small; but were we to judge of him by what he did, we should probably reckon him the richest potentate in Europe. A single instance will be sufficient to show the well-judged economy with which his benevolent plans were conducted. He gave 18,000 crowns to the magistrates of Bar to be employed in purchasing grain, when at a low price, to be sold out again to the poor at a moderate rate when\nStanislaus the price should rise above a certain sum. By this arrangement (say the authors of Dictionnaire Histo-\nrique), the money increases continually, and its good effects may in a short time be extended over the whole province.\n\nHe was a protector of the arts and sciences: he wrote several works of philosophy, politics, and morality, which were collected and published in France in 1765, in 4 vols, 8vo, under the title of Oeuvres de Philosophe Bien-\nfaisant, \"the works of the Benevolent Philosopher.\"","sp":241,"ep":242},{"h":"STANITZAS","t":"villages or small districts of the banks of the Don, inhabited by Cossacks.","sp":242,"ep":242},{"h":"STANLEY","t":"THOMAS, a learned English writer in the 17th century, was the son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Cumberlow-Green in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORDSHIRE\">Herefordshire</a>, knight.

See Botany Index.\u2014This singular tribe of plants is peculiar to the sandy deserts of Africa and Arabia. They are extremely succulent. From this peculiarity of structure, the power of retaining water to support and nourish them, they are enabled to live during the prevalent droughts of those arid regions. On this account the stapelia has been compared to the camel; and we are told that, by a very apt similitude, it has been denominated \"the camel of the vegetable kingdom.\" We must confess ourselves quite at a loss to see the propriety or aptitude of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. In many parts of the animal and vegetable economy there is doubtless a very obvious and striking analogy; but this analogy has been often carried too far; much farther than fair experiment and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> will in any degree support. It is perhaps owing to this inaccuracy in observing the peculiarity of structure and diversity of functions, that a resemblance is supposed to exist, as in the present case, where in reality there is none. The camel is provided with a bag or fifth stomach, in addition to the four with which ruminant animals are furnished. This fifth stomach is destined as a reservoir to contain water; and it is sufficiently capacious to receive a quantity of that necessary fluid, equal to the wants of the animal, for many days: and this water, as long as it remains in the fifth stomach, is said to be perfectly pure and unchanged. The stapelia, and other succulent plants, have no such reservoir. The water is equally, or nearly so, diffused through the whole plant. Every vessel and every cell is fully distended. But besides, this water, whether it be received by the roots, or absorbed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, has probably undergone a complete change, and become, after it has been a short time within the plant, a fluid possessed of very different qualities.\n\nThe peculiar economy in the stapelia, and other succulent plants, seems to exist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> and exhalant systems. The power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> is as much increased as the power of the exhalant or perspiratory vessels is diminished. In these plants, a small quantity of nourishment is required. There is no solid part to be formed, no large fruit to be produced. They generally have very small leaves, often are entirely naked; so that taking the whole plant, a small surface only is exposed to the action of light and heat, and consequently a much smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of water is decomposed than in plants which are much branched and furnished with leaves.\n\nTwo species of stapelia only were known at the beginning of the century. The unfortunate Forskal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of Niebhur, who was sent out by the king of Denmark to explore the interior of Arabia, and who fell a sacrifice to the pestilential diseases of those inhospitable regions, discovered two new species. Thunberg, in his Prodromus, has mentioned five more. Forty new species have been discovered by Mr Masson of Kew Gardens, who was sent out by his present Majesty for the purpose of collecting plants round the Cape of Good Hope. Descriptions of these, with elegant and highly finished coloured engravings, have lately been published. They are chiefly natives of the extensive deserts called Karroo, on the western side of the Cape.","sp":242,"ep":242},{"h":"STAPHYLEA","t":"BLADDER-NUT, a genus of plants belonging to the class of pentandria and order of trignya; and in the natural system arranged under the 23rd order, Tribulatae.

As all these are merely conjectures, (for no stars are now in the roof, nor are any said to have remained there so late as the reign of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>), it may be allowable to propose another conjectural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, as plausible perhaps as any of them. It is well known, that, before the banishment of the Jews under Edward I. their contracts and obligations were denominated in our ancient records flarra or flarrs, from a corruption of the Hebrew word, betar, a covenant. (Tovey's Angl. Judaic. 32. Selden. tit. of hon. ii. 34. Uxor Ebraica. i. 14.). These stars, by an ordinance of Richard I. preserved by Hoveden, were commanded to be enrolled and deposited in chests under three keys in certain places; one, and the most considerable, of which was in the king's exchequer at Westminster; and no star was allowed to be valid, unless it was found in some of the said repositories. (Mandorat in Scac. P. 6. Edw. I. prefixed to Maynard's year-book of Edw. II. fol. 8. Madox hist. exch. c. vii. \u00a7 4, 5, 6.). The room at the exchequer, where the chests containing these stars were kept, was probably called the star-chamber; and, when the Jews were expelled the kingdom, was applied to the use of the king's council, sitting in their judicial capacity. To confirm this, the first time the star-chamber is mentioned in any record, it is said to have been situated near the receipt of the exchequer at Westminster: (the king's council, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, justices, and other lages, were assembled en la chaumbre des efeilles pres la receipt at Westminster.

For in process of time, when the meaning of the Jewish stars were forgotten, the word star-chamber was naturally rendered in law French, la chaumbre des efeilles, and in law Latin camera stellata; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the style in Latin till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of that court.\n\nThis was a court of very ancient original; but new-modelled by statutes 3 Hen. VII. c. 1. and 21 Henry VIII. c. 20. consisting of divers lords spiritual and temporal, being privy-counsellors, together with two judges of the courts of common law, without the intervention of any jury. Their jurisdiction extended legally over riots, perjury, misbehaviour of sheriffs, and other notorious misdemeanors, contrary to the laws of the land. Yet this was afterwards (as Lord Clarendon informs us) stretched \"to the afflicting of all proclamations and orders of state; to the vindicating of illegal commissions and grants of monopolies; holding for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> that which pleased, and for just that which profited; and becoming both a court of law to determine civil rights, and a court of revenue to enrich the treasury: the council-table by proclamations enjoining to the people that which was not enjoined by the laws, and prohibiting that which was not prohibited; and the star-chamber, which consisted of the same persons in different rooms, confining the breach and disobedience to those proclamations by very great fines, imprisonments, and corporal severities: so that any disrespect to any acts of state, or to the persons of state-men, was in no time more penal, and the foundations of right never more in danger to be destroyed.\" For which reasons, it was finally abolished by statute 16 Car.

The best starch is white, soft, and friable, and easily broken into powder. Such as require fine starch, do not content themselves, like the flaxmen, with refuse wheat, but use the finest grain. The process is as follows: The grain, being well cleaned, is put to ferment in vessels full of water, which they expose to the sun while in its greatest heat; changing the water twice a day, for the space of eight or twelve days, according to the season. When the grain bursts easily under the finger, they judge it sufficiently fermented. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> perfected, and the grain thus softened, it is put, handful by handful, into a canvas-bag, to separate the flour from the husks; which is done by rubbing and beating it on a plank laid across the mouth of an empty vessel that is to receive the flour.\n\nAs the vessels are filled with this liquid flour, there is seen swimming at top a reddish water, which is to be carefully scummed off from time to time, and clean water is to be put in its place, which, after stirring the whole together, is also to be strained through a cloth or sieve, and what is left behind put into the vessel with new water, and exposed to the sun for some time. As the sediment thickens at the bottom, they drain off the water four or five times, by inclining the vessel, but without passing it through the sieve. What remains at bottom is the starch, which is cut in pieces to get out, and left to dry in the sun. When dry, it is laid up for use.\n\nThe following mill, was invented by M. Baum\u00e9 for grinding potatoes, with a view to extract starch from them.\n\nHe had a grater made of plate iron, in a cylindrical form (fig. 1) about seven inches in diameter, and about eight inches high; the bars made by stumping the holes are on the inside. This grater is supported upon three feet AAA, made of flat iron bars, seven feet high, strongly rivetted to the grater; the bottom of each foot is bent horizontally, and has a hole in it which receives a screw, as at A, fig. 4. A little below the upper end of the three feet is fixed a cross piece B (fig. 1 and 4), divided into three branches, and rivetted to the feet. This cross piece not only serves to keep the feet at a proper distance from each other, and to prevent their bending; but the centre of it having a hole cut in it, serves to support an axis or spindle of iron, to be presently described.\n\nThe upper end of this cylindrical grater has a diverging border of iron C (fig. 1, 4, and 7), about ten inches in diameter at the top, and five inches in height.\n\nWithin this cylindrical grater is placed a second grater (fig. 2 and 3), in the form of a cone, the point of which is cut off. The latter is made of thick plate iron, and the bars of the holes are on the outside; it is fixed, with the broad end at the bottom, as in fig. 4. At the upper end of the cone is rivetted a small triangle, or cross piece of iron, consisting of three branches D (fig. 2), in the middle of which is made, a square hole, to receive an axis or spindle; to give more resistance to this part of the cone, it is strengthened by means of a cap of iron E, which is fixed to the grater by means of rivets, and has also a square hole made in it, to let the axis pass through.\n\nFig. 3 represents the same cone seen in front; the base F has also a cross piece of three branches, rivetted to a hoop of iron, which is fixed to the inner surface of the cone; the centre of this cross piece has also a square hole for the passage of the axis.\n\nFig. 5 is a spindle or axis itself; it is a square bar of iron about sixteen inches long, and more than half an inch thick; round at the bottom, and also towards the top, where it fits into the cross piece I, fig. 7, and B, fig. 1 and 4; in these pieces it turns round, and by them it is kept in its place. It must be square at its upper extremity, that it may have a handle, about nine inches long, fixed to it, by means of which the conical grater is turned round. At G, (fig. 5), a small hole is made through the axis, to receive a pin H, by means of which the conical grater is kept at its proper height within the cylindrical one.\n\nFig. 6 is a bird's-eye view, in which the mill is represented placed in an oval tub, like a bathing-tub. I is the fore-mentioned triangular iron cross, fixed with screws to the side of the tub; the centre of it has a round hole, for the axis of the mill to move in when it is used.\n\nFig. 7 represents the mill in the oval tub; it is placed at one end of it, that the other end may be left free for any operation to be performed in it which may be necessary. A part of the tub is cut off, that the inside of it, and the manner of fixing the mill, may be seen. That the bottom of the tub may not be worn by the screws which pass through the feet of the mill, a deal board, about an inch thick, and properly shaped, is placed under the mill.\n\nWhen we wish to make use of this mill, it is to be fixed by the feet, in the manner already described; it is also fixed at the top, by means of the cross piece I, fig. 6, and 7. The tub is then to have water poured into it as high as K, and the top of the mill is to be filled with potatoes, properly washed and cut; the handle L is to be turned round, and the potatoes, after being ground between\nbetween the two graters, go out gradually at the lower part, being afflited by the motion produced in the water by the action of the mill.\n\nTo prepare starch from potatoes, says M. Baum\u00e9, any quantity of these roots may be taken, and soaked in a tub of water for about an hour; they are afterwards to have their fibres and shoots taken off, and then to be rubbed with a pretty strong brush, that the earth, which is apt to lodge in the inequalities of their surface, may be entirely removed; as this is done, they are to be washed, and thrown into another tub full of clean water. When the quantity which we mean to make use of has been thus treated, those which are too large are to be cut into pieces about the size of eggs, and thrown into the mill; that being already fixed in the oval tub, with the proper quantity of water: the handle is then turned round, and as the potatoes are grated they pass out at the bottom of the mill. The pulp which collects about the mill must be taken off from time to time with a wooden spoon, and put aside in water.\n\nWhen all the potatoes are ground, the whole of the pulp is to be collected in a tub, and mixed up with a great quantity of clean water. At the same time, another tub, very clean, is to be prepared, on the brim of which are to be placed two wooden rails, to support a hair sieve, which must not be too fine. The pulp and water are to be thrown into the sieve; the flour passes through with the water, and fresh quantities of water are successively to be poured on the remaining pulp, till the water runs through as clear as it is poured in. In this way we are to proceed till all the potatoes that were ground are used.\n\nThe pulp is commonly thrown away as useless; but it should be boiled in water, and used as food for animals; for it is very nourishing, and is about 3/5ths of the whole quantity of potatoes used.\n\nIt is farther to be observed that the liquor which has passed through the sieve is turbid, and of a brownish colour, on account of the extractive matter which is dissolved in it; it deposits, in the space of five or six hours, the flour which was suspended in it. When all the flour is settled to the bottom, the liquor is to be poured off and thrown away, being useless; a great quantity of very clean water is then to be poured upon the flour remaining at the bottom of the tub, which is to be stirred up in the water, that it may be washed, and the whole is to stand quiet till the day following. The flour will then be found to have settled at the bottom of the tub; the water is again to be poured off as useless, the flour washed in a fresh quantity of pure water, and the mixture passed through a silk sieve pretty fine, which will retain any small quantity of pulp which may have passed through the hair sieve. The whole must once more be suffered to stand quiet till the flour is entirely settled; if the water above it is perfectly clear and colourless, the flour has been sufficiently washed; but if the water has any tenible appearances either of colour or of taste, the flour must be again washed, as it is absolutely necessary that none of the extractive matter be suffered to remain.\n\nWhen the flour is sufficiently washed, it may be taken out of the tub with a wooden spoon; it is to be placed upon wicker frames covered with paper, and dried, properly defended from dust. When it is thoroughly dry, it is to be passed through a silk sieve, that if any clotted lumps should have been formed they may be divided. It is to be kept in glass vessels stoppered with paper only.\n\nA patent was granted in 1796 to Lord William Murray for his discovery of a method by which starch may be extracted from horse-chesnuts. It is as follows:\n\nTake the horse-chesnuts out of the outward green prickly husks; and either by hand, with a knife, or other tool, or else with a mill adapted for that purpose, very carefully pare off the brown rind, being particular not to leave the smallest speck, and to entirely eradicate the sprout or growth. Next take the nuts, and rasp, grate, or grind them fine into water, either by hand, or by a mill adapted for that purpose. Wash the pulp, which is thereby formed in this water, as clean as possible, through a coarse horse-hair sieve; this again wash through a finer sieve, and then again through a still finer, constantly adding clean water, to prevent any starch from adhering to the pulp. The last process is, to put it with a large quantity of water (about four gallons to a pound of starch) through a fine gauze, muslin, or lawn, so as entirely to clear it of all bran or other impurities. As soon as it settles, pour off the water; then mix it up with clean water, repeating this operation till it no longer imparts any green, yellow, or other colour to the water. Then drain it off till nearly dry, and set it to bake, either in the usual mode of baking starch, or else spread out before a brisk fire; being very attentive to stir it frequently to prevent its burning, that is to say, turning to a paste or jelly, which, on being dried, turns hard like horn. The whole process should be conducted as quickly as possible.\n\nMention is here made of a mill which may be employed to grind the horse-chesnuts; but it is not described; perhaps the one described above for grinding potatoes might answer the purpose.","sp":244,"ep":245},{"h":"STARK","t":"Dr. William, known to the public by a volume containing Clinical and Anatomical Observations, with some curious Experiments on Diet, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> in the month of July 1740; but the family from which he sprung was Scotch, and respectable for its antiquity. His grandfather John Stark of Killermont was a covenanter; and having appeared in arms against his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> at the battle of Bothwell bridge in the year 1679, became obnoxious to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and, to conceal himself, withdrew into Ireland. There is reason to believe that he had not imbibed either the extravagant zeal or the savage manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> party to which he adhered; for after residing a few years in the country which he had chosen for the scene of his banishment, he married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> daughter of Thomas Stewart, Esq. of Balymore in the north of Ireland; who, being descended of the noble family of Galloway, would not probably have matched his daughter to such an exile as a ruthless fanatic of the last century. By this lady Mr. Stark had several children; and his second son Thomas, who settled at Manchester as a wholesale linen-draper, and married Margaret Stirling, daughter of William Stirling, Esq. of Northwoodside, in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, was the father of the subject of this article. Another of his sons, the reverend John Stark, was minister of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>; and it was under the care of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> that our author received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, which, when we consider the character of the master,\nand reflect on the relation between him and his pupil, we may presume was calculated to store the mind of Dr Stark with those virtuous principles which influenced his conduct through life.\n\nFrom Lecropt young Stark was sent to the university of Glasgow, where, under the tuition of the doctors Smith and Black, with other eminent masters, he learned the rudiments of science, and acquired that mathematical accuracy, that logical precision, and that contempt of hypotheses, with which he prosecuted all his future studies. Having chosen physic for his profession, he removed from the university of Glasgow to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where he was soon distinguished, and honoured with the friendship of the late Dr Cullen; a man who was not more eminently conspicuous for the superiority of his own genius, than quick-minded in perceiving, and liberal in encouraging, genius in his pupils. Having finished his studies at Edinburgh, though he took there no degree, Mr Stark, in the year 1765, went to London, and devoted himself entirely to the study of physic and the elements of surgery; and looking upon anatomy as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> pillars of both these arts, he endeavoured to complete with Dr Hunter what he had begun with Dr Monro; and under these two eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> he appears to have acquired a high degree of anatomical knowledge. He likewise entered himself about this time a pupil at St George's hospital; for being disgusted, as he often confessed, with the inaccuracy or want of candour observable in the generality of practical writers, he determined to obtain an acquaintance with diseases at a better school and from an abler master; and to have from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> a standard, by which he might judge of the experience of others. With what industry he prosecuted this plan, and with what success his labours were crowned, may be seen in a series of Clinical and Anatomical Observations, which were made by him during his attendance at the hospital, and were published after his death by his friend Dr Carmichael Smyth. These observations give the public no cause to complain of want of candour in their author; for whatever delicacy he may have observed, when relating the cases of patients treated by other physicians, he has related those treated by himself with the utmost impartiality. Whilst attending the hospital, he likewise employed himself in making experiments on the blood, and other animal fluids; and also in a course of experiments in chemical pharmacy; but though accounts of these experiments were left behind him, we believe they have not yet been given to the public.\n\nIn the year 1767 Mr Stark went abroad, and obtained the degree of M.D in the university of Leyden, publishing an inaugural dissertation on the dyerery. On his return to London, he recommenced his studies at the hospital; and when Dr Black was called to the chemical chair in Edinburgh, which he has long filled with so much honour to himself and credit to the university, Dr Stark was solicited by several members of the university of Glasgow to stand a candidate for their professorship of the theory and practice of physic, rendered vacant by Dr Black's removal to Edinburgh. This however Dr Stark declined, being influenced by the advice of his English friends, who wished to detain him in London, and having likewise some prospects of an appointment in the hospital.\n\nIn the mean time he had commenced (1769) a series of experiments on diet, which he was encouraged to undertake by Sir John Pringle and Dr Franklin, whose friendship he enjoyed, and from whom he received many hints respecting both the plan and its execution. These experiments, or rather the imprudent zeal with which he prosecuted them, proved, in the opinion of his friends, fatal to himself; for he began them on the 12th of July 1769 in perfect health and vigour, and from that day, though his health varied, it was seldom if ever good, till the 23rd of February 1770, when he died, after suffering much uneasiness. His friend and biographer Dr Smyth thinks, that other causes, particularly chagrin and disappointment, had no small share in hastening his death; and as the Doctor was intimately acquainted with his character and disposition, his opinion is probably well-founded, though the pernicious effects of the experiments are visible in Dr Stark's own journal. When he entered upon them, the weight of his body was 12 stone 3 lb. avoidupois, which in a very few days was reduced to 11 stone 10 lb. 8 oz.; and though some kinds of food increased it, by much the greater part of what he used had a contrary effect, and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> on the whole to decrease till the day of his death. This indeed can excite no wonder. Though the professed object of his experiments was to prove that a pleasant and varied diet is equally conducive to health with a more strict and simple one, most of the dishes which he ate during these experiments were neither pleasant nor simple, but compounds, such as every stomach must nauseate. He began with bread and water; from which he proceeded to bread, water, and sugar; then to bread, water, and oil of olives; then to bread and water with milk; afterwards he tried bread and water with roast goose; bread and water with boiled beef; stewed lean of beef with the gravy and suet without bread; stewed lean of beef with the gravy, oil of fat or suet and water; flour, oil of fat, water and salt; flour, water, and salt; and a number of others infinitely more disagreeable to the stomach than even these, such as bread, fat of bacon ham, infusion of tea with sugar; and bread or flour with honey and the infusion of rosemary. But though we consider Dr Stark's experiments as whimsical, it cannot be denied that they indicate eccentricity of genius in the person who made them; and such of our readers as think genius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, may perhaps be of opinion, that he derived a ray from the celebrated Napier the inventor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>, who was his ancestor by both parents. At any rate, these experiments, of which a full account is given in the same volume with his clinical and anatomical observations, display an uncommon degree of fortitude, perseverance, self-denial, and zeal for the promoting of useful knowledge in their author; and with respect to his moral character, we believe it is with great justice that Dr Smyth compares him to Cato, by applying to him what was said of that virtuous Roman by Sallust\u2014\"Non divitiis cum divite, neque faciotione cum faciiose; sed cum strenuo virtute, cum modesto pudore, cum innocente abfinititia certabat; eafe, quam videri, bonus malebat.\"*\n\nSTARLING.

It was found convenient to distribute the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> into two classes, which required both a different mode of consideration and different principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>.\n\nTill the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> little science of this kind was possessed by the ancients, from whom we have received the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the centre of gravity, and his theory of the lever, are the foundations of our knowledge of common mechanics; and his theory of the equilibrium of floating bodies contains the greatest part of our hydrotatical knowledge. But it was as yet limited to the simplest cases; and there were some in which Archimedes was ignorant, or was mistaken. The marquis Guido Ubaldi, in 1578, published his theory of mechanics, in which the doctrines of Archimedes were well explained and considerably augmented. Stevinus, the celebrated Dutch engineer, published about 20 years after an excellent system of mechanics, containing the chief principles which now form the science of equilibrium among solid bodies. In particular, he gave the theory of inclined planes, which was unknown to the ancients, though it is of the very first importance in almost every machine. He even states in the most express terms the principle afterwards made the foundation of the whole of mechanics, and published as a valuable discovery by Varignon, viz., that three forces, whose directions and intensities are as the sides of a triangle, balance each other. His theory of the pressure of fluids, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>, is no less estimable, including every thing that is now received as a leading principle in the science. When we consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, even of the most learned, of that age, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> or phycico-mathematical knowledge, we must consider these performances as the works of a great genius; and we regret that they are so little known, being lost in a crowd of good writings on those subjects which appeared soon after.\n\nHitherto the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> had been turned entirely to equilibrium, and the circumstances necessary for producing it. Mechanicians indeed saw, that the energy of a machine might be somehow measured by the force which could be opposed or overcome by its intervention; but they did not remark, that the force which prevented its motion, but did no more than prevent it, was an exact measure of its energy, because it was in immediate equilibrium with the pressure exerted by that part of the machine with which it was connected. If this opposed force was less, or the force acting at the other extremity of the machine was greater, the mechanicians knew that the machine would move, and that work would be performed; but what would be the rate of its motion or its performance, they hardly pretended to conjecture. They had not studied the action of moving forces, nor conceived what was done when motion was communicated.\n\nThe great Galileo opened a new field of speculation in his work on Local Motion. He there considers a change of motion as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> and exact and adequate measure of a moving force; and he considers every kind of pressure as competent to the production of such changes.\u2014He contented himself with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this principle to the motion of bodies by the action of gravity, and gave the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>, which remains to this day without change, and only improved by considering the changes which are produced in it by the resistance of the air.\n\nSir Isaac Newton took up this subject nearly as Galileo had left it. For, if we except the theory of the centrifugal forces arising from rotation, and the theory of pendulums, published by Huygens, hardly anything had been added to the science of motion. Newton considered the subject in its utmost extent; and in his mathematical principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a> he considers every conceivable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of moving force, and determines the motion resulting from its action.\u2014His first application of these doctrines was to explain the celestial motions; and the magnificence of this subject caused it to occupy for a while the whole attention of the mathematicians. But the same work contained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> equally conducive to the improvement of common mechanics, and to the complete understanding of the mechanical actions of bodies. Philosophers began to make these applications also. They saw that every kind of work which is to be performed by a machine may be considered abstractedly as a retarding force; that the impulse of water or wind, which are employed as moving powers,\nact by means of pressures which they exert on the impelled point of the machine; and that the machine itself may be considered as an assemblage of bodies moveable in certain limited circumstances, with determined directions and proportions of velocity. From all these considerations resulted a general abstract condition of a body acted on by known powers. And they found, that after all conditions of equilibrium were satisfied, there remains a surplus of moving force. They could now state the motion which will ensue, the new resistance which this will excite, the additional power which this will absorb; and they at last determined a new kind of equilibrium, not thought of by the ancient mechanicians, between the resistance to the machine performing work and the moving power, which exactly balance each other, and is indicated, not by the rest, but by the uniform motion of the machine. In like manner, the mathematician was enabled to calculate that precise motion of water which would completely absorb, or, in the new language, balance the superiority of pressure by which water is forced through a sluice, a pipe, or canal, with a constant velocity.\n\nThus the general doctrines of motion came to be considered in two points of view, according as they balanced each other in a state of rest or of uniform motion. These two ways of considering the same subject required both different principles and a different manner of reasoning. The first has been named Statics, as expressing that rest which is the test of this kind of equilibrium. The second has been called Dynamics or Universal Mechanics, because the different kinds of motion are characteristic of the powers or forces which produce them. A knowledge of both is indispensible necessary for acquiring any useful practical knowledge of machines; and it was ignorance of the doctrines of accelerated and retarded motions which made the progress of practical mechanical knowledge so very slow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>. The mechanics, even of the moderns, before Galileo, went no further than to state the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the power and resistance which would be balanced by the intervention of a given machine, or the proportion of the parts of a machine by which two known forces may balance each other. This view of the matter introduced a principle, which even Galileo considered as a mechanical axiom, viz., that what is gained in force by means of a machine is exactly compensated by the additional time which it obliges us to employ. This is false in every instance, and not only prevents improvement in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of machines, but leads us into erroneous maxims of construction. The true principles of dynamics teach us, that there is a certain proportion of the machine, dependent on the kind and proportion of the power and resistance, which enables the machine to perform the greatest possible work.\n\nIt is highly proper therefore to keep separate these two ways of considering machines, that both may be improved to the utmost, and then to blend them together in every practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>.\n\nStatics therefore is preparatory to the proper study of mechanics; but it does not hence derive all its importance. It is the sole foundation of many useful parts of knowledge. This will be best seen by a brief enumeration.\n\n1. It comprehends all the doctrines of the excitement and propagation of pressure through the parts of solid bodies, by which the energies of machines are produced. A pressure is exerted on the impelled point of a machine, such as the float-boards or buckets of a mill-wheel. This excites a pressure at the pivots of its axle, which act on the points of support. This must be understood, both as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> and intensity, that it may be effectually resisted. A pressure is also excited at the acting tooth of the cog-wheel on the same axle, by which it urges round another wheel, exciting similar pressures on its pivots and on the acting tooth perhaps of a third wheel.\u2014Thus a pressure is ultimately excited in the working point of the machine, perhaps a wiper, which lifts a heavy flamer, to let it fall again on some matter to be pounded. Now statics teaches us the intensities and direction of all those pressures, and therefore how much remains at the working point of the machine unbalanced by resistance.\n\n2. It comprehends every circumstance which influences the stability of heavy bodies; the investigation and properties of the centre of gravity; the theory of the construction of arches, vaults, and domes; the attitudes of animals.\n\n3. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">strength of materials</a>, and the principles of construction, so as to make the proper adjustment of strength and strain in every part of a machine, edifice, or structure of any kind. Statics therefore furnishes us with what may be called a theory of carpentry, and gives us proper instructions for framing floors, roofs, centres, &c.\n\n4. Statics comprehends the whole doctrine of the pressure of fluids, whether liquid or aeriform, whether arising from their weight or from any external action. Hence therefore we derive our knowledge of the stability of ships, or their power of maintaining themselves in a position nearly upright, in opposition to the action of the wind on their sails. We learn on what circumstances of figure and flowage this quality depends, and what will augment or diminish it.\n\nVery complete examples will be given in the remaining part of this work of the advantages of this separate consideration of the condition of a machine at rest and in working motion; and in what yet remains to be delivered of the hydraulic doctrines in our account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">Water-Works</a> in general, will be perceived the propriety of stating apart the equilibrium which is indicated by the uniform motion of the fluid. The observations too which we have to make on the strength of the materials employed in our edifices or mechanical structures, will be examples of the investigation of those powers, pressures, or strains, which are excited in all their parts.","sp":247,"ep":248},{"h":"STATIONARY","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, the state of a planet when, to an observer on the earth, it appears for some time to stand still, or remain immoveable in the same place in the heavens.

It is disputed between statuary and painting, which of the two is the most difficult and the most artful.\nStatuary is also used for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">artificer</a> who makes statues. Phidias was the greatest statuary among the ancients, and Michael Angelo among the moderns.\n\nStatue, is defined to be a piece of sculpture in full relief, representing a human figure. Daviler more scientifically defines statue a representation, in high relief and insulated, of some person distinguished by his birth, merit, or great actions, placed as an ornament in a fine building, or exposed in a public place, to preserve the memory of his worth. In Greece one of the highest honours to which a citizen could aspire was to obtain a statue.\n\nStatues are formed with the chisel, of several matters, as stone, marble, plaster, &c. They are also cast of various kinds of metal, particularly gold, silver, brass, and lead. For the method of casting statues, see the article FOUNDERY OF STATUES.\n\nStatues are usually distinguished into four general kinds. The first are those less than the life; of which kind we have several statues of great men, of kings, and of gods themselves. The second are those equal to the life; in which manner it was that the ancients, at the public expense, used to make statues of persons eminent for virtue, learning, or the services they had done. The third are those that exceed the life; among which those that surpassed the life once and a half were for kings and emperors; and those double the life, for heroes. The fourth kind were those that exceeded the life twice, thrice, and even more, and were called colossi. See COLOSSUS.\n\nEvery statue resembling the person whom it is intended to represent, is called statua iconica. Statues acquire various other denominations. 1. Thus, allegorical statue is that which, under a human figure, or other symbol, represents something of another kind; as a part of the earth, a season, age, element, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, hour, &c. 2. Curule statues, are those which are represented in chariots drawn by bigae or quadrigae, that is, by two or four horses; of which kind there were several in the circuses, hippodromes, &c. or in cars, as we see some, with triumphal arches on antique medals. 3. Equestrian statue, that which represents some illustrious person on horseback, as that famous one of Marcus Aurelius at Rome; that of King Charles I. at Charing-cross; King George II. in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>-Square, &c. 4. Greek statue, denotes a figure that is naked and antique; it being in this manner the Greeks represented their deities, athletes of the Olympic games, and heroes; the statues of heroes were particularly called Achillian statues, by reason of the great number of figures of Achilles in most of the cities of Greece. 5. Hydraulic statue, is any figure placed as an ornament of a fountain or grotto, or that does the office of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JET_D_EAU\">jet d'eau</a>, a cock, spout, or the like, by any of its parts, or by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> it holds: the like is to be understood of any animal serving for the same use. 6. Pedestrian statue, a statue standing on foot; as that of King Charles II. in the Royal Exchange, and of King James II. in the Privy-Gardens. 7. Roman statue, is an appellation given to such as are clothed, and which receive various names from their various dresses. Those of emperors, with long gowns over their armour, were called statues palliatae; those of captains and cavaliers, with coats of arms, thoracatae; those of soldiers with cuirasses, loricate; those of senators and augurs, trabeatae; those of magistrates with long robes, togatae; those of the people with a plain tunic, tunicatae; and, lastly, those of women with long trains, foliatae.\n\nIn repairing a statue cast in a mould, they touch it up with a chisel, graver, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, to finish the places which have not come well off: they also clear off the hair, and what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> in the joints and projections.\n\nSTATUE.

Thus we say, the steam of boiling water, of malt, of a tan-bed, &c. It is distinguished from smoke by its not having been produced by combustion, by not containing any foot, and by its being condensible by cold into water, oil, inflammable spirits, or liquids composed of these.\n\nWe see it rise in great abundance from bodies when they are heated, forming a white cloud, which diffuses like itself and disappears at no very great distance from the body from which it was produced. In this case the surrounding air is found loaded with the water or other juices which seem to have produced it, and the steam seems to be completely soluble in air, as salt is in water, composing while thus united a transparent elastic fluid.\n\nBut in order to its appearance in the form of an when opaque white cloud, the mixture with or dissemination eliminated in air seems absolutely necessary. If a tea-kettle boils violently, so that the steam is formed at the spout in great abundance, it may be observed, that the visible cloud is not formed at the very mouth of the spout, but at a small distance before it, and that the vapour is perfectly transparent at its first emission. This is rendered still more evident by fitting to the spout of the tea-kettle\ntea-kettle a glass pipe of any length, and of as large a diameter as we please. The steam is produced as copiously as without this pipe, but the vapour is transparent through the whole length of the pipe. Nay, if this pipe communicate with a glass vessel terminating in another pipe, and if the vessel be kept sufficiently hot, the steam will be as abundantly produced at the mouth of this second pipe as before, and the vessel will be quite transparent. The visibility therefore of the matter which constitutes the steam is an accidental or extraneous circumstance, and requires the admixture with air; yet this quality again leaves it when united with air by solution. It appears therefore to require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> in the air. The appearances are quite agreeable to this notion: for we know that one perfectly transparent body, when minutely divided and diffused among the parts of another transparent body, but not dissolved in it, makes a mass which is visible. Thus oil beaten up with water makes a white opaque mass.\n\nIn the mean time, as steam is produced, the water gradually wastes in the tea kettle, and will soon be totally expended, if we continue it on the fire. It is reasonable therefore to suppose, that this steam is nothing but water changed by heat into an elastic form. If so, we should expect that the privation of this heat would leave it in the form of water again. Accordingly this is fully verified by experiment; for if the pipe fitted to the spout of the tea kettle be surrounded with cold water, no steam will issue, but water will continually trickle from it in drops: and if the process be conducted with the proper precautions, the water which we thus obtain from the pipe will be found equal in quantity to that which disappears from the tea-kettle.\n\nThis is evidently the common process for distilling; and the whole appearances may be explained by saying, that the water is converted by heat into an elastic vapour, and that this, meeting with colder air, imparts to it the heat which it carried off as it arose from the heated water, and being deprived of its heat it is again water. The particles of this water being vastly more remote from each other than when they were in the tea-kettle, and thus being disseminated in the air, become visible, by reflecting light from their anterior and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> surfaces, in the same manner as a transparent salt becomes visible when reduced to a fine powder. This disseminated water being presented to the air in a very extended surface, is quickly diffused by it, as pounded salt is in water, and again becomes a transparent fluid, but of a different nature from what it was before, being no longer convertible into water by depriving it of its heat.\n\nAccordingly this opinion, or something very like it, has been long entertained. Muthenbroeck expressly says, that the water in the form of vapour carries off with it all the heat which is continually thrown in by the fuel. But Dr Black was the first who attended minutely to the whole phenomena, and enabled us to form distinct notions of the subject. He had discovered that it was not sufficient for converting ice into water that it be raised to that temperature in which it can no longer remain in the form of ice. A piece of ice of the temperature 32\u00b0 Fahrenheit's thermometer will remain a very long while in air of the temperature 50\u00b0 before it be all melted, remaining all the while of the temperature 32\u00b0, and therefore continually absorbing heat from the surrounding air. By comparing the time in which the ice had its temperature changed from 28\u00b0 to 32\u00b0 with the subsequent time of its complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIQUEFACTION\">liquefaction</a>, he found that it absorbed about 130 or 140 times as much heat as would raise its temperature one degree; and he found that one pound of ice, when mixed with one pound of water 140 degrees warmer, was just melted, but without rising in its temperature above 32\u00b0. Hence he justly concluded, that water differed from ice of the same temperature by containing, as a constituent ingredient, a great quantity of fire, or of the cause of heat, united with it in such a way as not to quit it for another colder body, and therefore so as not to go into the liquor of the thermometer and expand it. Considered therefore as the possible cause of heat, it was latent, which Dr Black expressed by the abbreviated term LATENT HEAT. If any more heat was added to the water it was not latent, but would readily quit it for the thermometer, and, by expanding the thermometer, would show what is the degree of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> heat, while fluidity alone is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of the combined and latent heat.\n\nDr Black, in like manner, concluded, that in order to convert water into an elastic vapour, it was necessary, not only to increase its uncombined heat till its temperature is 212\u00b0, in which state it is just ready to become elastic; but also to pour into it a great quantity of fire, or the cause of heat, which combines with every particle of it, so as to make it repel, or to recede from, its adjoining particles, and thus to make it a particle of an elastic fluid. He supposed that this additional heat might be combined with it so as not to quit it for the thermometer; and therefore so as to be in a latent state, having elastic fluidity for its sole indication.\n\nThis opinion was very consistent with the phenomenon of boiling off a quantity of water. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of heat to it causes it gradually to rise in its temperature till it reaches the temperature 212\u00b0. It then begins to send off elastic vapour, and is slowly expended in this way, continuing all the while of the same temperature. The steam also is of no higher temperature, as appears by holding a thermometer in it. We must conclude that this steam contains all the heat which is expended in its formation. Accordingly the foiling power of steam is well known; but it is extremely difficult to obtain precise measures of the quantity of heat absorbed by water during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> into steam. Dr Black endeavoured to ascertain this point, by comparing the time of raising its temperature a certain number of degrees with the time of boiling it off by the same external heat; and he found that the heat latent in steam, which balanced the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, was not less than 800 degrees. He also directed Dr Irvine of Glasgow to the form of an experiment for measuring the heat actually extracted from such steam during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRIGERATORY\">refrigeratory</a> of a still, which was found to be not less than 774 degrees. Dr Black was afterwards informed by Mr Watt, that a course of experiments, which he had made in each of these ways with great precision, determined the latent heat of steam under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere to be about 948 or 950 degrees. Mr Watt also found that water would distil with great ease.\nSteam in vacuo when of the temperature 70\u00b0; and that in this case the latent heat of the steam is not less than 1200 or 1300 degrees: and a train of experiments, which he had made by distilling in different temperatures, made him conclude that the sum of the sensible and latent heats is a constant quantity. This is a curious and not an improbable circumstance; but we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of the particulars of these experiments. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> evidently presupposes a knowledge of that particular temperature in which the water has no heat; but this is a point which is still subject to debate.\n\nThis conversion of liquids (for it is not confined to water, but obtains also in ardent spirits, oils, mercury, &c.) is the cause of their boiling. The heat is applied to the bottom and sides of the vessel, and gradually accumulates in the fluid, in a sensible state, uncombined, and ready to quit it and enter into any body that is colder, and to diffuse itself between them. Thus it enters into the fluid of a thermometer, expands it, and thus gives us the indication of the degree in which it has been accumulated in the water; for the thermometer swells as long as it continues to absorb sensible heat from the water: and when the sensible heat in both is in equilibrium, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> depending on the nature of the two fluids, the thermometer rises no more, because it absorbs no more heat or fire from the water; for the particles of water which are in immediate contact with the bottom, are now (by this gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of liquidity) at such distance from each other, that their laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for each other and for heat are totally changed. Each particle either no longer attracts, or perhaps it repels its adjoining particle, and now accumulates round itself a great number of the particles of heat, and forms a particle of elastic fluid, so related to the adjoining new formed particles, as to repel them to a distance at least a hundred times greater than their distances in the state of water. Thus a mass of elastic vapour of sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> is formed. Being at least ten thousand times lighter than an equal bulk of water, it must rise up through it, as a cork would do, in form of a transparent ball or bubble, and getting to the top, it dissipates, filling the upper part of the vessel with vapour or steam. Thus, by boiling the liquid into bubbles, which are produced all over the bottom and sides of the vessel, it produces the phenomenon of ebullition or boiling. Observe, that during its passage up through the water, it is not changed or condensed; for the surrounding water is already so hot that the sensible or uncombined heat in it, is in equilibrium with that in the vapour, and therefore it is not disposed to absorb any of that heat which is combined as an ingredient of this vapour, and gives it its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. For this reason, it happens that water will not boil till its whole mass be heated up to 212\u00b0; for if the upper part be colder, it robs the rising bubble of that heat which is necessary for its elasticity, so that it immediately collapses again, and the surface of the water remains still. This may be perceived by holding water in a Florence flask over a lamp or chuffer. It will be observed, some time before the real ebullition, that some bubbles are formed at the bottom, and get up a very little way, and then disappear. The distances which they reach before collapsing increase as the water continues to warm farther up the mass, till at last it breaks out into boiling. If the handle of a tea-kettle be grasped with the hand, a tremor will be felt for some little time before boiling, arising from the little succussions which are produced by the collapsing of the bubbles of vapour. This is much more violent, and is really a remarkable phenomenon, if we suddenly plunge a lump of red hot iron into a vessel of cold water, taking care that no red part be near the surface. If the hand be now applied to the side of the vessel, a most violent tremor is felt, and sometimes strong thumps: these arise from the collapsing of very large bubbles. If the upper part of the iron be too hot, it warms the surrounding water so much, that the bubbles from below come up through it uncondensed, and produce ebullition without this succussion. The great resemblance of this tremor to the feeling which we have during the shock of an earthquake has led many to suppose that these last are produced in the same way, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, notwithstanding the objections which we have elsewhere stated to it, is by no means unfounded.\n\nIt is owing to a similar cause that violent thumps are sometimes felt on the bottom of a tea-kettle, especially observed in one which has been long in use. Such are frequently the boiling crusts on the bottom with a stony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCRETION\">concretion</a>. This crust is sometimes detached in little scales. When one of them adheres by one end to the bottom, the water gets between them in a thin film. Hence it may be heated considerably above the boiling temperature, and it suddenly rises up in a large bubble, which collapses immediately. A smooth shell lying on the bottom will produce this appearance very violently, or a thimble with the mouth down.\n\nIn order to make water boil, the fire must be applied to the bottom or sides of the vessel. If the heat be applied at the top of the water, it will waste away without boiling; for the very superficial particles to the bottom are first supplied with the heat necessary for rendering them elastic, and they fly off without agitating the rest of the vessel.\n\nSince this disengagement of vapour is the effect of its\n\n(A) We explained the opaque and cloudy appearance of steam, by saying that the vapour is condensed by coming into contact with the cooler air. There is something in the form of this cloud which is very inexplicable. The particles of it are sometimes very distinguishable by the eye; but they have not the smart star-like brilliancy of very small drops of water, but give the fainter reflection of a very thin film or vehicle like a soap bubble. If we attend also to their motion, we see them descending very slowly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the descent of a solid drop; and this vesicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> is established beyond a doubt by looking at a candle through a cloud of steam. It is seen surrounded by a faint halo with prismatic colours, precisely such as we can demonstrate by optical laws to belong to a collection of vehicles, but totally different from the halo which would be produced by a collection of solid drops. It is very difficult to conceive how these vehicles can be formed of watery particles, each of which was furthered...\nSteam. Its elasticity, and since this elasticity is a determined force when the temperature is given, it follows, that fluids cannot boil till the elasticity of the vapour overcomes the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> fluid and of the atmosphere. Therefore, when this pressure is removed or diminished, the fluids must sooner overcome what remains, and boil at a lower temperature. Accordingly it is observed that water will boil in an exhausted receiver when of the heat of the human body. If two glass balls A and B (fig. 1.) be connected by a flender tube, and one of them A be filled with water (a small opening or pipe b being left at top of the other), and this be made to boil, the vapour produced from it will drive all the air out of the other, and will at last come out itself, producing steam at the mouth of the pipe. When the ball B is observed to be occupied by transparent vapour, we may conclude that the air is completely expelled. Now that the pipe by sticking it into a piece of tallow or bees-wax; the vapour in B will soon condense, and there will be a vacuum. The flame of a lamp and blow-pipe being directed to the little pipe, will cause it immediately to close and seal hermetically. We now have a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> or toy called a Pulse Glass. Grasp the ball A in the hollow of the hand; the heat of the hand will immediately expand the bubble of vapour which may be in it, and this vapour will drive the water into B, and then will blow up through it for a long while, keeping it in a state of violent ebullition, as long as there remains a drop or film of water in A. But care must be taken that B is all the while kept cold, that it may condense the vapour as fast as it rises through the water. Touching B with the hand, or breathing warm on it, will immediately stop the ebullition in it. When the water in A has thus been distipated, grasp B in the hand; the water will be driven into A, and the ebullition will take place there as it did in B. Putting one of the balls into the mouth will make the ebullition more violent in the other, and the one in the mouth will feel very cold. This is a pretty illustration of the rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of the heat by the particles of water which are thus converted into elastic vapour. We have seen this little toy suspended by the middle of the tube like a balance, and thus placed in the inside of a window, having two holes a and b cut in the pane, in such a situation that when A is full of water and preponderates, B is opposite to the hole b. Whenever the room became sufficiently warm, the vapour was formed in A, and immediately drove the water into B, which was kept cool by the air coming into the room through the hole b. By this means B was made to preponderate in its turn, and A was then opposite to the hole a, and the process was now repeated in the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and this amusement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> as long as the room was warm enough.\n\nWe know that liquors differ exceedingly in the temperatures necessary for their ebullition. This forms the great chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between volatile and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol8.html#article-FIXED_BODIES\">fixed bodies</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of temperature in which they boil, or are converted into permanently elastic vapour, under the pressure of the atmosphere, is not a certain measure of their differences of volatility. The natural boiling point of a body is that in which it will be converted into elastic vapour under no pressure, or in vacuo. The boiling point in the open air depends on the law of the elasticity of the vapour in relation to its heat. A fluid A may be less volatile, that is, may require more heat to make it boil in vacuo, than a fluid B: But if the elasticity of the vapour of A be more increased by an increase of temperature than that of the vapour of B, A may boil at as low, or even at a lower temperature, in the open air, than B does; for the increased elasticity of the vapour of A may sooner overcome the pressure of the atmosphere. Few experiments have been made on the relation between the temperature and the elasticity of different vapours. So long ago as the year 1765, we had occasion to examine the boiling points of all such liquors as we could manage in an air-pump; that is, such as did not produce vapours which destroyed the valves and the leathers of the pistons: and we thought that the experiments gave us reason to conclude, that the elasticity of all the vapours was affected by heat nearly in the same degree. For we found that the difference between their boiling points in the air and in vacuo was nearly the same in all, namely, about 120 degrees Fahrenheit's thermometer. It is exceedingly difficult to make experiments of this kind: The vapours are so condensible, and change their elasticity so prodigiously by a trifling change of temperature, that it is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to examine this point with precision. It is, however, as we shall see by and bye, a subject of considerable practical importance in the mechanic arts; and an accurate knowledge of the relation would be of great use also to the distiller: and it would be no less important to discover the relation of their elasticity and density, by examining their compressibility, in the same manner as we have ascertained the relation in the case of what we call aerial fluids, that is, such as we have never observed in the form of liquids or solids, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their union with each other or with other bodies. In the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a> we took notice of it as something like a natural law, that all these airs, or gases as they are now called, had their elasticity very nearly, if not exactly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to their density. This appears from the experiments of Achard, of Fontana, and others, on vital air, inflammable air, fixed air, and some others. It gives us some presumption to suppose that it holds in all elastic vapours whatever, and that it is connected with their elasticity; and it renders it somewhat probable that they are all elastic, only because the cause of heat (the matter of fire if you will) is elastic, and that their law of elasticity, in respect of density, is the same with that of fire. But it must be\n\nrounded with many particles of fire, now communicated to the air, and how each of these vesicles shall include within it a ball of air; but we cannot refuse the fact. We know, that if, while linseed oil is boiling or nearly boiling, the surface be obliquely struck with the ladle, it will be dashed into a prodigious number of exceedingly small vesicles, which will float about in the air for a long while. Mr Sauflure was (we think) the first who distinctly observed this vesicular form of mists and clouds; and he makes considerable use of it in explaining several phenomena of the atmosphere.\nbe observed, that although we thus assign the elasticity of fire as the immediate cause of the elasticity of vapour, in the same way, and on the same grounds, that we ascribe the fluidity of brine to the fluidity of the water which holds the solid salt in solution, it does not follow that this is owing, as is commonly supposed, to a repulsion or tendency to recede from each other exerted by the particles of fire. We are as much entitled to infer a repulsion of unlimited extent between the particles of water; for we see that by its means a single particle of sea-salt becomes disseminated through the whole of a very large vessel. If water had not been a visible and palpable substance, and the salt only had been visible and palpable, we might have formed a similar notion of chemical solution. But we, on the contrary, have considered the quaquaversum motion or expansion of the salt as a dissemination among the particles of water; and we have ascribed it to the strong attraction of the atoms of salt for the atoms of water, and the attraction of these salt for each other, thinking that each atom of salt accumulates round itself a multitude of watery atoms, and by so doing must recede from the other saline atoms. Nay, we farther see, that by forces which we naturally consider as attractions, an expansion may be produced of the whole mass, which will act against external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> forces. It is thus that wood swells with almost insuperable force by imbibing moisture; it is thus that a sponge immersed in water becomes really an elastic compressible body; resembling a blown bladder; and there are appearances which warrant us to apply this mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> to elastic fluids.\u2014When air is suddenly compressed, a thermometer included in it shows a rise of temperature; that is, an appearance of heat now redundant which was formerly combined. The heat seems to be squeezed out as the water from the sponge.\n\nAccordingly this opinion, that the elasticity of steam and other vapours is owing merely to the attraction for fire, and the consequent dissemination of their particles through the whole mass of fire, has been entertained by many naturalists, and it has been ascribed entirely to attraction. We by no means pretend to decide; but we think the analogy by far too slight to found any confident opinion on it. The aim is to solve phenomena by attraction only, as if it were of more easy conception than repulsion. Considered merely as facts, they are quite on a par. The appearances of nature in which we observe actual recesses of the parts of body from each other, are as distinct, and as frequent and familiar, as the appearances of actual reproach. And if we attempt to go farther in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, and to conceive the way and the forces by which either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> or recesses of the atoms are produced, we must acknowledge that we have no conception of the matter; and we can only say, that there is a cause of these motions, and we call it a force, as in every case of the production of motion. We call it attraction or repulsion just as we happen to contemplate an access or a recess. But the analogy here is not only slight, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, and fails most in those cases which are most simple, and where we should expect it to be most complete. We can squeeze water out of a sponge, it is true, or out of a piece of green wood; but when the white of an egg, the tremella, or some gums, swell to a hundred times their dry dimensions by imbibing water, we cannot squeeze out a particle. If fluidity (for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> must equally apply to this as to vapourousness) be owing to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of the extended matter of fire, which gradually expanded the solid by its very minute additions; and if the accumulation round a particle of ice, which is necessary for making it a particle of water, be so great in comparison of what gives it the expansion of one degree, as experiment obliges us to conclude\u2014it seems an inevitable consequence that all fluids should be many times rarer than the solids from which they are produced. But we know that the difference is trifling in all cases, and in some (water, for instance, and iron) the solid is rarer than the fluid. Many other arguments, (each of them perhaps of little weight when taken alone, but which are all systematically connected) concur in rendering it much more probable that the matter of fire, in causing elasticity, mutual reacts immediately by its own elasticity, which we cannot but conceive in any other way than as a mutual tendency between its particles to receive from each other; and we doubt not but that, if it could be obtained alone, we should find it an elastic fluid like air. We even think that there are cases in which it is observed in this state. The elastic force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> is very much beyond the elasticity of all the vapours which are produced in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLAGRATION\">deflagration</a>, each of them being expanded as much as we can reasonably suppose by the great heat to which they are exposed. The writer of this article exploded some gunpowder mixed with a considerable portion of finely powdered quartz, and another parcel mixed with fine filings of copper. The elasticity was measured by the penetration of the ball which was discharged, and was great in the degree now mentioned. The experiment was so conducted, that much of the quartz and copper was collected; none of the quartz had been melted, and some of the copper was not melted. The heat, therefore, could not be such as to explain the elasticity by expansion of the vapours; and it became not improbable that fire was acting here as a detached chemical fluid by its own elasticity. But to return to our subject.\n\nThere is one circumstance in which we think our own experiments show a remarkable difference (at least probably in degree) between the condensible and incondensible vapours. It is well known, that when air is very suddenly expanded, cold is produced, and heat when it is suddenly condensed. When making experiments with and in the hopes of discovering the connection between the condensible elasticity and density of the vapours of boiling water, pours; and also of boiling spirits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, we found the change of density accompanied by a change of temperature vastly greater than in the case of incondensible gases. When the vapour of boiling water was suddenly allowed to expand into five times its bulk, we observed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of a large and sensitive air thermometer to be at least four or five times greater than in a similar expansion of common air of the same temperature. The chemical reader will readily see reasons for expecting, on the contrary, a smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of temperature, both on account of the much greater rarity of the fluid, and on account of a partial condensation of its water and the consequent disengagement of combined heat.\n\nThis difference in the quantity of fire which is combined in vapours and gases is so considerable, as to authorize us to suppose that there is some difference in the constitution of vapours and gases, and that the tution of connection vapour.\nconnection between the specific bases of the vapour and the fire which it contains, is not the same in air, for instance, as in the vapour of boiling water; and this difference may be the reason why the one is easily condensable by cold, while the other has never been exhibited in a liquid or solid form, except by means of its chemical union with other substances. In this particular instance we know that there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> difference\u2014that in vital or atmospheric air there is not only a prodigious quantity of fire which is not in the vapour of water, but that it also contains light, or the cause of light, in a combined state. This is fully evinced by the great discovery of Mr Cavendish of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of water. Here we are taught that water (and consequently its vapour) consists of air from which the light and greatest part of the fire have been separated. And the subsequent discoveries of the celebrated Lavoisier show, that almost all the condensible gases with which we are acquainted consist either of airs which have already lost much of their fire (and perhaps light too), or of matters in which we have no evidence of fire or light being combined in this manner.\n\nThis consideration may go far in explaining this difference in the condensibility of these different species of aerial fluids, the gases and the vapours; and it is with this qualification only that we are disposed to allow that all bodies are condensible into liquids or solids by abstracting the heat. In order that vital air may become liquid or solid, we hold that it is not sufficient that a body be presented to it which shall simply abstract its heat. This would only abstract its uncombined fire. But another and much larger portion remains chemically combined by means of light. A chemical affinity must be brought into action which may abstract, not the fire from the oxygen (to speak the language of Mr Lavoisier), but the oxygen from the fire and light. And our production is not the detached basis of air, but detached heat and light, and the formation of an oxide of some kind.\n\nTo prosecute the chemical consideration of STEAMS farther than these general observations, which are applicable to all, would be almost to write a treatise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, and would be a repetition of many things which have been treated of in sufficient detail in other articles of this work. We shall therefore conclude this article with some other observations, which are also general, with respect to the different kinds of coercible vapours, but which have a particular relation to the following article.\n\nSteam or vapour is an elastic fluid, whose elasticity balances the pressure of the atmosphere; and it has been produced from a solid or liquid body raised to a sufficient temperature for giving it this elasticity; that is, for causing the fluid to boil. This temperature must vary with the pressure of the air. Accordingly it is found, that when the air is light (indicated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> being low), the fluid will boil sooner. When the barometer stands at 30 inches, water boils at the temperature 212\u00b0. If it stands so low as 28 inches, water will boil at 208\u00b0. In the plains of Quito, or at Guadalajara in Mexico, where the barometer stands at about 21 inches, water will boil at 195\u00b0. Highly rectified alcohol will boil at 160\u00b0, and vitriolic ether will boil at 88\u00b0 or 89\u00b0. This is a temperature by no means uncommon in these places; nay, the air is frequently warmer. Vitriolic ether, therefore, is a liquor which can hardly be known in those countries. It is hardly possible to preserve it in that form. If a phial have not its stopper firmly tied down, it will be blown out, and the liquor will boil and be dissipated in steam. On the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIMBORAZO\">Chimborazo</a>, the human blood must be disposed to give out air-bubbles.\n\nWe said some time ago, that we had concluded, from some experiments made in the receiver of an air-pump, that fluids boil in vacuo at a temperature nearly 120\u00b0 lower than that necessary for their boiling in the open air. But we now see that this must have been a gross approximation; for in these experiments from them, the fluids were boiling under the pressure of the vapour which they produced, and which could not be abstracted from them by working the pump. It appears from the experiments of Lord Charles Cavendish, mentioned in the article Pneumatics, that water of the temperature 75\u00b0 only was converted into elastic vapour, which balanced a pressure of 4/5ths of an inch of mercury, and in this state it occupied the receiver, and did not allow the mercury in the gauge to sink to the level. As fast as this was abstracted by working the air-pump, more of it was produced from the surface of the water, so that the pressure continued the same, and the water did not boil. Had it been possible to produce a vacuum above this water, it would have boiled for a moment, and would even have continued to boil, if the receiver could have been kept very cold.\n\nUpon reading these experiments, and some very curious ones of Mr Nairne, in the Phil. Trans. vol. lxvii., the writer of this article was induced to examine morements to particularly the relation between the temperature of the determine vapour and its elasticity, in the following manner:\n\nABCD (fig. 2.) is the section of a small digester made of copper. Its lid, which is fastened to the body of the vessel with screws, is pierced with three holes, each of which vapour and had a small pipe soldered into it. The first hole was furnished with a brass safety-valve V, nicely fitted to it by grinding. The area of this valve was exactly 4/5th of an inch. There reposed on the flasks at top of this valve the arm of a steelyard carrying a sliding weight. This arm had a scale of equal parts, so adjusted to the weight that the number on the scale corresponded to the inches of mercury, whose pressure on the under surface of the valve is equal to that of the steelyard on its top; so that when the weight was at the division 10, the pressure of the steelyard on the valve was just equal to that of a column of mercury 10 inches high, and 4/5th of an inch base. The middle hole contained a thermometer T firmly fixed into it, so that no vapour could escape by its sides. The ball of this thermometer was but a little way below the lid. The third hole received occasionally the end of a glass pipe SGE, whose descending leg was about 36 inches long. When this syphon was not used, the hole was properly shut with a plug.\n\nThe vessel was half filled with distilled water which had been purged of air by boiling. The lid was then fixed on, having the third hole S plugged up. A lamp being placed under the vessel, the water boiled, and the steam issued copiously by the safety-valve. The thermometer stood at 213\u00b0, and a barometer in the room at 29.9 inches. The weight was then put on the fifth division. The thermometer immediately began to rise; and when it was at 225\u00b0, the steam issued by the sides...\nSteam of the valve. The weight was removed to the 10th division; but before the thermometer could be distinctly observed, the steam was issuing at the valve. The lamp was removed farther from the bottom of the vessel, that the progress of heating might be more moderate; and when the steam ceased to issue from the valve, the thermometer was at 227\u00b0. The weight was now shifted to 15\u00b0; and by gradually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the lamp, the steam again issued; and the thermometer was at 132\u00b0. This mode of trial was continued all the way to the 75th division of the scale. The experiments were then repeated in the contrary order; that is, the weight being suspended at the 75th division, and the steam issuing strongly at the valve, the lamp was withdrawn, and the moment the steam ceased to come out, the thermometer was observed. The same was done at the 70th, 65th, division, &c. These experiments were several times repeated both ways; and the means of all the results for each division are expressed in the following table, where column 1st expresses the elasticity of the steam, being the sum of 29.9, and the division of the fleelyard; column 2d expresses the temperature of the steam corresponding to this elasticity.\n\n| I. | II. |\n|----|-----|\n| 35 inches. | 219\u00b0 |\n| 40 | 226 |\n| 45 | 232 |\n| 50 | 237 |\n| 55 | 242 |\n| 60 | 247 |\n| 65 | 251 |\n| 70 | 255 |\n| 75 | 259 |\n| 80 | 263 |\n| 85 | 267 |\n| 90 | 270\u00bd |\n| 95 | 274\u00bd |\n| 100 | 278 |\n| 105 | 281 |\n\nA very different process was necessary for ascertaining the elasticity of the steam in lower temperatures, and consequently under smaller pressures than that of the atmosphere. The glass syphon SGF was now fixed into its hole in the lid of the digester. The water was made to boil smartly for some time, and the steam issued copiously both at the valve and at the syphon. The lower end of the syphon was now immersed into a broad faucer of mercury, and the lamp instantly removed, and everything was allowed to grow cold. By this the steam was gradually condensed, and the mercury rose in the syphon, without sensible sinking in the faucer. The valve and all the joints were smeared with a thick clammy cement, composed of oil, tallow, and rosin, which effectually prevented all ingress of air. The weather was clear and frosty, and the barometer standing at 29.84, and the thermometer in the vessel at 42\u00b0. The mercury in the syphon stood at 29.7, or somewhat higher, thus showing a very complete condensation. The whole vessel was surrounded with pounded ice, of the temperature 32\u00b0. This made no sensible change in the height of the mercury. A mark was now made at the surface of the mercury. One observer was stationed at the thermometer, with instructions to call out as the thermometer reached the divisions 42, 47, 52, 57, and so on by every five degrees till it should attain the boiling heat. Another observer noted the corresponding descents of the mercury by a scale of inches, which had its beginning placed at 29.84 from the surface of the mercury in the faucer.\n\nThe pounded ice was now removed, and the lamp placed at a considerable distance below the vessel, so as to warm its contents very slowly. These observations being very easily made, were several times repeated, and their mean results are set down in the following table: Only observe, that it was found difficult to note down the descents for every fifth degree, because they succeeded each other too fast. Every 10th was judged sufficient for establishing the law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. The first column of the table contains the temperature, and the second the descent (in inches) of the mercury from the mark 29.84.\n\n| Temperature | Descent |\n|-------------|---------|\n| 32\u00b0         | 8       |\n| 40          | 0.1     |\n| 50          | 0.2     |\n| 60          | 0.35    |\n| 70          | 0.53    |\n| 80          | 0.82    |\n| 90          | 1.18    |\n| 100         | 1.61    |\n| 110         | 2.25    |\n| 120         | 3.00    |\n| 130         | 3.95    |\n| 140         | 5.15    |\n| 150         | 6.72    |\n| 160         | 8.65    |\n| 170         | 11.05   |\n| 180         | 14.05   |\n| 190         | 17.85   |\n| 200         | 22.62   |\n| 210         | 28.65   |\n\nFour or five numbers at the top of the column of elasticities are not so accurate as the others, because the mercury passed pretty quickly through these points. But the progress was extremely regular through the remaining points; so that the elasticities corresponding to temperatures above 70\u00b0 may be considered as very accurately ascertained.\n\nNot being altogether satisfied with the method employed for measuring the elasticity in temperatures above that of boiling water, a better form of experiment was adopted. (Indeed it was the want of other apparatus which made it necessary to employ the former.) A glass tube was procured of the form represented in fig. 3, having a little cistern L, from the top and bottom of which proceeded the syphons K and MN. The cistern contained mercury, and the tube MN was of a slender bore, and was about six feet two inches long. The end K was firmly fixed in the third hole of the lid, and the long leg of the syphon was furnished with a scale of inches, and firmly fastened to an upright post.\n\nThe lamp was now applied at such a distance from the vessel as to warm it slowly, and make the water boil, the steam escaping for some time through the safety-valve. A heavy weight was then suspended on the fleelyard; such as it was known that the vessel would support, and at the same time, such as would not allow the steam to force the mercury out of the long tube. The thermometer began immediately to rise, as also the mercury\nSteam mercury in the tube MN. Their correspondent stations are marked in the following table:\n\n| Temperature | Elasticity |\n|-------------|------------|\n| 212\u00b0        | 8.0        |\n| 220         | 5.9        |\n| 230         | 14.6       |\n| 240         | 25.0       |\n| 250         | 30.9       |\n| 260         | 50.4       |\n| 270         | 64.2       |\n| 280         | 106.0      |\n\nThis form of the experiment is much more susceptible of accuracy than the other, and the measures of elasticity are more to be depended on. In repeating the experiment, they were found much more constant; whereas, in the former method, differences occurred of two inches and upwards.\n\nWe may now connect the two sets of experiments into one table, by adding to the numbers in this last table the constant height 29.9, which was the height of the mercury in the barometer during the last set of observations.\n\n| Temperature | Elasticity |\n|-------------|------------|\n| 32\u00b0         | 0.0        |\n| 40          | 0.1        |\n| 50          | 0.1        |\n| 60          | 0.35       |\n| 70          | 0.55       |\n| 80          | 0.82       |\n| 90          | 1.25       |\n| 100         | 1.6        |\n| 110         | 2.25       |\n| 120         | 3.0        |\n| 130         | 3.95       |\n| 140         | 5.15       |\n| 150         | 6.72       |\n| 160         | 8.65       |\n| 170         | 11.05      |\n| 180         | 14.05      |\n| 190         | 17.85      |\n| 200         | 22.62      |\n| 210         | 28.65      |\n| 220         | 33.8       |\n| 230         | 44.7       |\n| 240         | 54.9       |\n| 250         | 66.8       |\n| 260         | 80.3       |\n| 270         | 94.1       |\n| 280         | 105.9      |\n\nIn the memoirs of the Royal Academy of Berlin for 1782, there is an account of some experiments made by Mr Achard on the elastic force of steam, from the temperature 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0. They agree extremely well with those mentioned here, rarely differing more than two or three tenths of an inch. He also examined the elasticity of the vapour produced from alcohol, and found, that when the elasticity was equal to that of the vapour of water, the temperature was about 35\u00b0 lower. Thus, when the elasticity of both was measured by 28.1 inches of mercury, the temperature of the watery vapour was 209\u00b0, and that of the spirituous vapour was 173\u00b0. When the elasticity was 18.5, the temperature of the water was 189.5, and that of the alcohol 154.6. When the elasticity was 11.05, the water was 168\u00b0, and the alcohol 13.04. Observing the difference between the temperatures of equally elastic vapours of water and alcohol not to be constant, but gradually to diminish, in Mr Achard's experiments, along with the elasticity, it became interesting to discover whether and at what temperature this difference would vanish altogether. Experiments were accordingly made by the writer of this article, similar to those made with water. They were not made with the same scrupulous care, nor repeated as they deserved, but they furnished rather an unexpected result. The following table will give the reader a distinct notion of them:\n\n| Temperature | Elasticity |\n|-------------|------------|\n| 32\u00b0         | 0.0        |\n| 40          | 0.1        |\n| 60          | 0.8        |\n| 80          | 0.8        |\n| 100         | 3.9        |\n| 120         | 6.9        |\n| 140         | 12.2       |\n| 160         | 21.3       |\n| 180         | 34.4       |\n| 200         | 52.4       |\n| 220         | 78.5       |\n| 240         | 115.5      |\n\nWe say that the result was unexpected; for as the natural boiling point seemed by former experiments to be fault in common all fluids about 120\u00b0 or more below their boiling point in the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere, it was reasonable to expect that the temperature at which they cease to emit sensibly elastic steam would have some quality elastic relation to their temperatures when emitting steam of any determinate elasticity. Now as the vapour of alcohol has its temperature about 36\u00b0 lower than the temperature of water equally elastic, it was to be expected that the temperature at which it ceased to be sensibly affected would be several degrees lower than 32\u00b0. It is evident, however, that this is not the case. But this is a point that deserves more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, because it is closely connected with the chemical relation between the element (if such there be) of fire and the bodies into whose composition it seems to enter as a constituent part. What is the temperature 32\u00b0 to make it peculiarly connected with elasticity? It is a temperature assumed by us for our own convenience, on account of the familiarity of water in our experiments. Ether, we know, boils in a temperature far below this, as appears from Dr Cullen's experiments narrated in the Essays Physical and Literary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. On the faith of former experiments, we may be pretty certain that it will boil in vacuo at the temperature \u201414\u00b0, because in the air it boils at +106\u00b0. Therefore we may be certain, that the steam or vapour of ether, when of the temperature 32\u00b0, will be very sensibly elastic. Indeed Mr Lavoirier says, that if it be exposed in an exhausted receiver in winter, its vapour will support mercury at the height of 10 inches. A series of experiments on this vapour similar to the above would be very instructive. We even wish that those on alcohol were more carefully repeated. If we draw a curve line, of which the abscissa is the line of temperatures, and the ordinates are the corresponding heights of the mercury in these experiments on water and alcohol,\nwe shall observe, that although they both sensibly coincide at $32^\\circ$, and have the abscissa for their common tangent, a very small error of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> may be the cause of this, and the curve which expresses the elasticity of spirituous vapour may really intersect the other, and go backwards considerably beyond $32^\\circ$.\n\nThis range of experiments gives rise to some curious and important reflections. We now see that no particular temperature is necessary for water affuming the form of permanently elastic vapour; and that it is highly probable that it affumes this form even at the temperature $32^\\circ$; only its elasticity is too small to afford us any sensible measure. It is well known that even ice evaporates (see experiments to this purpose by Mr Wilson in the Philosophical Transactions, when a piece of polished metal covered with hoar-frost became perfectly clear by exposing it to a dry frosty wind).\n\nEven mercury evaporates, or is converted into elastic vapour, when all external pressure is removed. The dim film which may frequently be observed in the upper part of a barometer which stands near a stream of air, is found to be small globules of mercury sticking to the inside of the tube. They may be seen by the help of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> glass, and are the best test of a well made barometer. They will be entirely removed by causing the mercury to rise along the tube. It will lick them all up. They consist of mercury which had evaporated in the void space, and was afterwards condensed by the cold glass. But the elasticity is too small to occasion a sensible depression of the column, even when considerably warmed by a candle.\n\nMany philosophers accordingly imagine, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> in low temperatures is produced in this way. But we cannot be of this opinion, and must still think that this kind of evaporation is produced by the dissolving power of the air. When moist air is suddenly rarefied, there is always a precipitation of water. This is most distinctly seen when we work an air-pump briskly. A mist is produced, which we see plainly fall to the bottom of the receiver. But by this new doctrine the very contrary should happen, because the tendency of water to appear in the elastic form is promoted by removing the external pressure; and we really imagine that more of it now actually becomes simple elastic watery vapour. But the mist or precipitation shows incontrovertibly, that there had been a previous solution. Solution is performed by forces which act in the way of attraction; or, to express it more safely, solutions are accompanied by the mutual approaches of the particles of the menstrum and solvent; all such tendencies are observed to increase by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of distance. Hence it must follow, that air of double density will dissolve more than twice as much water. Therefore when we suddenly rarefy saturated air (even though its heat should not diminish) some water must be let go. What may be its quantity we know not; but it may be more than what would now become elastic by this diminution of surrounding pressure; and it is not unlikely but this may have some effect in producing the vehicles which we found so difficult to explain.\n\nThese may be filled with pure watery vapour, and be floating in a fluid composed of water dissolved in air. An experiment of Fontana's seems to put this matter out of doubt. A distilling apparatus AB (fig. 4.) was so contrived, that the heat was applied above the surface of the water in the alembic A. This was done by inclosing it in another vessel CC, filled with hot water. In the receiver B there was a sort of barometer D, with an open cistern, in order to see what pressure there was on the surface of the fluid. While the receiver and alembic contained air, the heat applied at A produced no sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> during several hours: But on opening a cock E in the receiver at its bottom, and making the water in the alembic to boil, steam was produced which soon expelled all the air, and followed it through the cock. The cock was now shut, and the whole allowed to grow cold by removing the fire, and applying cold water to the alembic. The barometer fell to a level nearly. Then warm water was allowed to get into the outer vessel CC. The barometer rose a little, and the distillation went on briskly without the smallest ebullition in the alembic. The conclusion is obvious: while there was air in the receiver and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> pipe, the distillation proceeded entirely by the dissolving power of this air. Above the water in the alembic it was quickly saturated; and this saturation proceeded slowly along the fill air in the communicating pipe, and at last might take place through the whole of the receiver. The sides of the receiver being kept cold, should condense part of the water dissolved in the air in contact with them, and this should trickle down the sides and be collected. But any person who has observed how long a crystal of blue vitriol will lie at the bottom of a glass of still water before the tinge will reach the surface, will see that it must be next to impossible for distillation to go on in these circumstances; and accordingly none was observed. But when the upper part of the apparatus was filled with pure watery vapour, it was supplied from the alembic as fast as it was condensed in the receiver, just as in the pulle glass.\n\nAnother inference which may be drawn from these experiments is, that Nature seems to affect a certain law in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of aeriform fluids by heat. They seem to be dilatable nearly in proportion of their present dilatation. For if we suppose that the vapours resemble air, in having their elasticity in any given temperature proportional to their density, we must suppose that if steam of the elasticity 60, that is, supporting 60 inches of mercury, were subjected to a pressure of 30 inches, it would expand into twice its present bulk. The augmentation of elasticity therefore is the measure of the bulk into which it would expand in order to acquire its former elasticity. Taking the increase of elasticity therefore as a measure of the bulk into which it would expand under one constant pressure, we see that equal increments of temperature produce nearly equal multiplications of bulk. Thus if a certain diminution of temperature diminishes its bulk $\\frac{1}{4}$th, another equal diminution of temperature will diminish this new bulk $\\frac{1}{4}$th very nearly. Thus in our experiments, the temperatures $110^\\circ$, $140^\\circ$, $170^\\circ$, $200^\\circ$, $230^\\circ$, are in arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>, having equal differences; and we see that the corresponding elasticities $2.25$, $5.15$, $11.35$, $22.62$, $44.7$, are very nearly in the continued proportion of $1$ to $2$. The elasticity corresponding to the temperature $260$ deviates considerably from this law, which would give $88$ or $89$ instead of $80$; and the deviation\nSteam deviation increases in the higher temperatures. But still we feel that there is a considerable approximation to this law; and it will frequently assist us to recollect, that whatever be the present temperature, an increase of 30 degrees doubles the elasticity and the bulk of watery vapour.\n\nThat $4^\\circ$ will increase the elasticity from 1 to $1 + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n| Temperature | Elasticity |\n|-------------|------------|\n| 8           | 1          |\n| 10          | 1          |\n| 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 1          |\n| 18          | 1          |\n| 22          | 1          |\n| 24          | 1          |\n| 26          | 1          |\n\nThis is sufficiently exact for most practical purposes. Thus an engineer finds that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> cools the cylinder of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">steam-engine</a> to $192^\\circ$. It therefore leaves a steam whose elasticity is three-fifths of its full elasticity, = 18 inches \\(^2\\). But it is better at all times to have recourse to the table. Observe, too, that in the lower temperatures, i.e. below $110^\\circ$, this increment of temperature does more than double the elasticity.\n\nThis law obtains more remarkably in the incalculable vapours; such as vital air, atmospheric air, fixed air, &c., all of which have also their elasticity proportional to their bulk inversely; and perhaps the deviation from the law in steams is connected with their chemical difference of constitution. If the bulk were always augmented in the same proportion by equal augmentations of temperature, the elasticities would be accurately represented by the ordinates of a logarithmic curve, of which the temperatures are the corresponding abscissae; and we might contrive such a scale for our thermometer, that the temperatures would be the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> of the elasticities, or of the bulks having equal elasticity; or, with our present scale, we may find such a multiplier \\(m\\) for the number \\(x\\) of degrees of our thermometer (above that temperature where the elasticity is equal to unity), that this multiple shall be the common logarithm of the elasticity \\(y\\); so that \\(mx = \\log y\\).\n\nBut our experiments are not sufficiently accurate for determining the temperature where the elasticity is measured by 1 inch; because in these temperatures the elasticities vary by exceedingly small quantities. But if we take 11.24 for the unit of elasticity, and number our temperature from $170^\\circ$, and make \\(m = 0.00035\\), we shall find the product \\(mx\\) to be very nearly the logarithm of the elasticity. The deviations, however, from this law, are too great to make this equation of any use. But it is very practicable to frame an equation which shall correspond with the experiments to any degree of accuracy; and it has been done for air in a translation of General Roy's Measurement of the Bale at Hounslow Heath into French by Mr Prony. It is as follows: Let \\(x\\) be the degrees of Reaumur's thermometer; let \\(y\\) be the expansion of 10,000 parts of air; let \\(e = 10\\), \\(m = 2.7979\\), \\(n = 0.01768\\); then \\(y = e^{m + nx} - 627.5\\). Now \\(e\\) being = 10, it is plain that \\(e^{m + nx}\\) is the number, of which \\(m + nx\\) is the common logarithm. This formula is very exact as far as the temperature $60^\\circ$; but beyond this it needs a correction; because air, like the vapour of water, does not expand in the exact proportion of its bulk.\n\nWe observe this law considerably approximated to in And is confirmed by the augmentation of the bulk or elasticity of elastic vapours; that is, it is a fact that a given increment of approximate temperature makes very nearly the same proportional augmentation of bulk and elasticity. This gives us some notion of the manner in which the supposed expanding of the bulk causes produces the effect. When vapour of the bulk or elasticity \\(4\\) is expanded into a bulk \\(5\\) by an addition of 10 degrees of elastic vapours, a certain quantity of fire goes into it, and is accumulated round each particle, in such a manner that the temperature of each, which formerly was \\(m\\), is now \\(m + 10\\). Let it now receive another equal augmentation of temperature. This is now \\(m + 20\\), and the bulk is \\(5 \\times 5\\) or \\(64\\), and the arithmetical increase of bulk is \\(1\\). The absolute quantity of fire which has entered it is greater than the former, both on account of the greater augmentation of space and the greater temperature. Consequently if this vapour be compressed into the bulk \\(5\\), there must be heat or fire in it which is not necessary for the temperature \\(m + 20\\), far less for the temperature \\(m + 10\\). It must therefore emerge, and be disposed to enter a thermometer which has already the temperature \\(m + 20\\); that is, the vapour must grow hotter by compression; not by squeezing out the heat, like water out of a sponge, but because the law of attraction for heat is deranged. It would be a very valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> to our knowledge to learn with precision the quantity of sensible heat produced in this way; but no satisfactory experiments have yet been made. M. Lavoisier, with his chemical friends and colleagues, were busily employed in this inquiry; but the wickedness of their countrymen deprived the world of this and many other important additions which we might have expected from this celebrated and unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. He had made, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with M. de la Place, a numerous train of accurate and expensive experiments for measuring the quantity of latent or combined heat in elastic vapours. This is evidently a very important point to the distiller and practical chemist. This heat must all come from the fuel; and it is greatly worth while to know whether any saving may be made of this article. Thus we know that distillation will go on either under the pressure of the air, or in an alembic and receiver from which the air has been expelled by steam; and we know that this last may be conducted in a very low temperature, even not exceeding that of the human body. But it is uncertain whether this may not employ even a greater quantity of fuel, as well as occasion a great expense of time. We are disposed to think, that when there is no air in the apparatus, and when the condensation can be speedily performed, the proportion of fuel expended to the fluid which comes over will diminish continually as the heat, and consequently the density of the steam, is augmented; because in this case the quantity of combined heat must be less. In the mean time, we earnestly recommend the trial of this mode of distillation in vessels cleared of air. It is undoubtedly of great advantage to be able to work with smaller fires; and it would secure us against all accidents of blowing off the\nSteam, the head of the hill, often attended with terrible consequences (B).\n\nWe must not conclude this article without taking notice of some natural phenomena which seem to owe their origin to the action of elastic steam.\n\nWe have already taken notice of the resemblance of the tremor and succussions observed in the shocks of many earthquakes to those which may be felt in a vessel where water is made to boil internally, while the breaking out of the ebullition is stifled by the cold of the upper parts; and we have likewise stated the objections which are usually made to this theory of earthquakes. We may perhaps refine the subject under the article Volcano; but in the meantime we do not hesitate to say, that the wonderful appearances of the Geyser spring in Iceland (see Huer; and Iceland, No. 3\u20145.) are undoubtedly produced by the expansion of steam in ignited caverns. Of these appearances we suppose the whole train to be produced as follows.\n\nA cavern may be supposed of a shape analogous to CBDEF (fig. 5.), having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> funnel AB issuing from a depressed part of the roof. The part F may be lower than the rest, remote, and red-hot. Such places we know to be frequent in Iceland. Water may be continually trickling into the part CD. It will fill it up to B, and even up to E, and then trickle slowly along into F. As soon as any gets into contact with an ignited part, it expands into elastic steam, and is partly condensed by the cold sides of the cavern, which it gradually warms, till it condenses no more. This production of steam hinders not in the smallest degree the trickling of more water into F, and the continual production of more steam. This now presses on the surface of the water in CD, and causes it to rise gradually in the funnel BA; but slowly, because its cold surface is condensing an immense quantity of steam. We may easily suppose that the water trickles faster into F than it is expended in the production of steam; so that it reaches farther into the ignited part, and may even fall in a stream into some deeper pit highly ignited. It will now produce steam in vast abundance, and of prodigious elasticity; and at once push up the water through the funnel in a solid jet, and to a great height. This must continue till the surface of the water sinks to BD. If the lower end of the funnel have any inequalities or notches, as is most likely, the steam will get admission along with the water, which in this particular place is boiling hot, being superficial, and will get to the mouth of the funnel, while water is still pressed in below. At last the steam gets in at B on all sides; and as it is converging to B, along the surface of the water, with prodigious velocity it sweeps along with it much water, and blows it up through the funnel with great force. When this is over, the remaining steam blows out unmixed with water, growing weaker as it is expended, till the bottom of the funnel is again stopped by the water increasing in the cavern CBD. All the phenomena above ground are perfectly conformable to the necessary consequences of this very probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the cavern. The feeling of being lifted up, immediately before the jet, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is owing to a real heaving up of the whole roof of the cavern by the first expansion of the great body of steam. We had an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the phenomena from persons well qualified to judge of these matters who visited these celebrated springs in 1789.\n\nSTEAM-Engine, is the name of a machine which derives its moving power from the elasticity and condensibility of the steam of boiling water. It is the most valuable present which the arts of life have ever received from the philosopher. The mariner's compass, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>, gunpowder, and other most useful servants to human weaknesses and ingenuity, were the productions of chance, and we do not exactly know to whom we are indebted for them; but the steam-engine was, in the very beginning, the result of reflection, and the production of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> mind; and every improvement it has received, and every alteration in its construction and principles, were also the results of philosophical study.\n\nThe steam-engine was beyond all doubt invented by Steam on the marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a> during the reign of Charles II., sine invent. This nobleman published in 1663 a small book entitled marquis of A Century of Inventions; giving some obscure and Worcester's enigmatical account of a hundred discoveries or contrivances of his own, which he extols as of great importance to the public. He appears to have been a person of much knowledge and great ingenuity; but his description or accounts of these inventions seem not so much intended to instruct the public, as to raise wonder; and his encomiums on their utility and importance\n\n(B) We earnestly recommend this subject to the consideration of the philosopher. The laws which regulate the formation of elastic vapour, or the general phenomena which it exhibits, give us that link which connects chemistry with mechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. Here we see chemical affinities and mechanical forces set in immediate opposition to each other, and the one made the indication, characteristic, and measure of the other. We have not the least doubt that they make but one science, the Science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>; nor do we despair of seeing the phenomena of solution, precipitation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, nay animal and vegetable secretion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a>, successfully investigated, as cases of local motion, and explained by the agency of central forces. Something of this kind, and that not inconsiderable, was done when Dr Cullen first showed how the double affinities might be illustrated by the affinities of numbers. Dr Black gave to this hint (for it was little more) that elegant precision which characterizes all his views. Mr Kirwan has greatly promoted this study by his numerous and ingenious examples of its application; and the most valuable passages of the writings of Mr Lavoisier, are those where he traces with logical precision the balancings of force which appear in the chemical phenomena. It is from the similar balancings and consequent measurements, which may be observed and obtained in the present case, that we are to hope for admission into this almost unbounded science of contemplation. We have another link equally interesting and promising, viz. the production of heat by friction. This also highly deserves the consideration of the mathematical philosopher.\nance are to a great degree extravagant, resembling more the puff of an advertising tradesman than the patriotic communications of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. The marquis of Worcester was indeed a projector, and very importunate and mysterious within his applications for public encouragement. His account, however, of the steam-engine, although by no means fit to give us any distinct notions of its structure and operation, is exact as far as it goes, agreeing precisely with what we now know of the subject. It is No. 68. of his inventions. His words are as follow: \"This admirable method which I propose of raising water by the force of fire has no bounds if the vessels be strong enough: for I have taken a cannon, and having filled it three-fourths full of water, and shut up its muzzle and touch-hole, and exposed it to the fire for 24 hours, it burst with a great explosion. Having afterwards discovered a method of fortifying vessels internally, and combined them in such a way that they filled and acted alternately, I have made the water spout in an uninterrupted stream 40 feet high; and one vessel of rarefied water raised 40 of cold water. The person who conducted the operation had nothing to do but turn two cocks; so that one vessel of water being consumed, another begins to force, and then to fill itself with cold water, and so on in succession.\"\n\nIt does not appear that the noble inventor could ever interest the public by these accounts. His character as a projector, and the many failures which persons of this turn of mind daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, probably prejudiced people against him, and prevented all attention to his projects. It was not till towards the end of the century, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a> was prosecuted all over Europe with uncommon ardour, that these notions again engaged attention. Captain Savary, a person also of great ingenuity and ardent mind, saw the reality and practicability of the marquis of Worcester's project. He knew the great expansive power of steam, and had discovered the inconceivable rapidity with which it is converted into water by cold; and he soon contrived a machine for raising water, in which both of these properties were employed. He says, that it was entirely his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. Dr Defaguliers insists that he only copied the marquis's invention, and charges him with gross plagiarism, and with having bought up and burned the copies of the marquis's book, in order to secure the honour of the discovery to himself. This is a very grievous charge, and should have been substantiated by very distinct evidence. Defaguliers produces none such; and he was much too late to know what happened at that time. The argument which he gives is a very foolish one, and gave him no title to consider Savary's experiment as a falsehood; for it might have happened precisely as Savary relates, and not as it happened to Defaguliers. The fact is, that Savary obtained his patent of invention after a hearing of objections, among which the discovery of the marquis of Worcester was not mentioned; and it is certain that the account given in the Century of Inventions could instruct no person who was not sufficiently acquainted with the properties of steam to be able to invent the machine himself.\n\nCaptain Savary obtained his patent after having actually erected several machines, of which he gave a description in a book intitled The Miner's Friend, published in 1696, and in another work published in 1699. Much about this time Dr Papin, a Frenchman and fellow of the Royal Society, invented a method of dissolving bones and other animal solids in water, by confining them in clothe vessels, which he called digesters, so as to acquire a great degree of heat. For it must be observed in this place, that it had been discovered long before (in 1684) by Dr Hooke, the most inquisitive experimental philosopher of that inquisitive age, that water could not be made to acquire above a certain temperature in the open air; and that as soon as it begins to boil, its temperature remains fixed, and an increase of heat only produces a more violent ebullition, and a more rapid waste. But Papin's experiments made the elastic power of steam very familiar to him; and when he left England and settled as professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> at Marburgh, he made many awkward attempts to employ this force in mechanics, and even for raising water. It appears that he had made experiments with this view in 1698, by order of Charles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANDGRAVE\">landgrave</a> of Hesse. For this reason the French affect to consider him as the inventor of the steam-engine. He indeed published some account of his invention in 1707; but he acknowledges that Captain Savary had also, and without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with him, invented the same thing. Whoever will take the trouble of looking at the description which he has given of these inventions, which are to be seen in the Acta Eruditorum Lipsiae, and in Leupold's Theatrum Machinarum, will see that they are most awkward, absurd, and impracticable. His conceptions of natural operations were always vague and imperfect, and he was neither philosopher nor mechanician.\n\nWe are thus anxious about the claim of those gentlemen, because a most respectable French author, Mr Bofaut, says in his Hydrodynamique, that the first notion of the steam-engine was certainly owing to Dr Papin, who had not only invented the digester, but had in 1695 published a little performance describing a machine for raising water, in which the pistons are moved by the vapour of boiling water alternately dilated and condensed. Now the fact is, that Papin's first publication was in 1707, and his piston is nothing more than a floater on the surface of the water, to prevent the waste of steam by condensation; and the return of the piston is not produced, as in the steam-engine, by the condensation of the steam, but by admitting the air and a column of water to press it back into its place. The whole contrivance is so awkward, and so unlike any distinct notions of the subject, that it cannot do credit to any person. We may add, that much about the same time Mr Amontons contrived a very ingenious but intricate machine, which he called the fire-wheel. It consisted of a number of buckets placed in the circumference of a wheel, and communicating with each other by very intricate circuitous passages. One part of this circumference was exposed to the heat of a furnace, and another to a stream or cistern of cold water. The communications were so disposed, that the steam produced in the buckets on one side of the wheel drove the water into buckets on the other side, so that one side of the wheel was always much heavier than the other; and it must therefore turn round, and may execute some work. The death of the inventor, and the intricacy of the machine, caused it to be neglected. Another member of the Parisian academy of sciences (Mr Deffandes) also presented to the academy a project of a steam-wheel, where the impulsive force of the va-\npour was employed; but it met with no encouragement. The English engineers had by this time so much improved Savary's first invention, that it supplanted all others. We have therefore no hesitation in giving the honour of the first and complete invention to the marquis of Worcester; and we are not disposed to refuse Captain Savary's claim to originality as to the construction of the machine, and even think it probable that his own experiments made him see the whole, independent of the marquis's account.\n\nCaptain Savary's engine, as improved and simplified by himself, is as follows.\n\nA (fig. 6.) represents a strong copper boiler properly built up in a furnace. There proceeds from its top a large steam-pipe B, which enters into the top of another strong vessel R called the receiver. This pipe has a cock at C called the steam-cock. In the bottom of the receiver is a pipe F, which communicates sidewise with the rising pipe KGH. The lower end H of this pipe is immersed in the water of the pit or well, and its upper part K opens into the cistern into which the water is to be delivered. Immediately below the pipe of communication F there is a valve G, opening when pressed from below, and shutting when pressed downwards. A similar valve is placed at I, immediately above the pipe of communication. Lastly, there is a pipe ED which branches off from the rising pipe, and enters into the top of the receiver. This pipe has a cock D called the injection-cock. The mouth of the pipe ED has a nozzle pierced with small holes, pointing from a centre in every direction. The keys of the two cocks C and D are united, and the handle g is called the regulator.\n\nLet the regulator be so placed that the steam-cock C is open and the injection-cock D is shut; put water into the boiler A, and make it boil strongly. The steam coming from it will enter the receiver, and gradually warm it, much steam being condensed in producing this effect. When it has been warmed so as to condense no more, the steam proceeds into the rising pipe; the valve G remains shut by its weight; the steam lifts the valve I, and gets into the rising pipe, and gradually warms it. When the workman feels this to be the case, or hears the rattling of the valve I, he immediately turns the steam-cock so as to shut it, the injection-cock still remaining shut (at least we may suppose this for the present.) The apparatus must now cool, and the steam in the receiver collapses into water. There is nothing now to balance the pressure of the atmosphere; the valve I remains shut by its weight; but the air incumbent on the water in the pit presses up this water through the suction-pipe HG, and causes it to lift the valve G, and flow into the receiver R, and fill it to the top, if not more than 20 or 25 feet above the surface of the pit water.\n\nThe steam-cock is now opened. The steam which, during the cooling of the receiver, has been accumulating in the boiler, and acquiring a great elasticity by the action of the fire, now rushes in with great violence, and, pressing on the surface of the water in the receiver, causes it to shut the valve G and open the valve I by its weight alone, and it now flows into the rising pipe, and would stand on a level if the elasticity of the steam were no more than what would balance the atmospheric pressure. But it is much more than this, and therefore it presses the water out of the receiver into the rising pipe, and will even cause it to come out at K, if the elasticity of the steam is sufficiently great. In order to ensure this, the boiler has another pipe in its top, covered with a safety-valve V, which is kept down by a weight W suspended on a steel-yard LM. This weight is so adjusted that its pressure on the safety-valve is somewhat greater than the pressure of a column of water VK as high as the point of discharge K. The fire is so regulated that the steam is always issuing a little by the loaded valve V. The workman keeps the steam-valve open till he hears the valve I rattle. This tells him that the water is all forced out of the receiver, and that the steam is now following it. He immediately turns the regulator which shuts the steam-cock, and now, for the first time, opens the injection-cock. The cold water trickles at first through the holes of the nozzle f, and falling down through the steam, begins to condense it; and then its elasticity being less than the pressure of the water in the pipe KEDf, the cold water spouts in all directions through the nozzle, and, quick as thought, produces a complete condensation. The valve G now opens again by the pressure of the atmosphere on the water of the pit, and the receiver is soon filled with cold water. The injection-cock is now shut, and the steam-cock opened, and the whole operation is now repeated; and so on continually.\n\nThis is the simple account of the process, and will serve to give the reader an introductory notion of the operation; but a more minute attention must be paid to many particulars before we can see the properties and defects of this ingenious machine.\n\nThe water is driven along the rising pipe by the defects of elasticity of the steam. This must in the boiler, and this makes every part of the machine, exert a pressure on every square inch of the vessels equal to that of the upright column of water. Suppose the water to be raised 100 feet, about 25 of this may be done in the suction-pipe; that is, the upper part of the receiver may be about 25 feet above the surface of the pit-water. The remaining 75 must be done by forcing, and every square inch of the boiler will be squeezed out by a pressure of more than 30 pounds. This very moderate height therefore requires very strong vessels; and the marquis of Worcester was well aware of the danger of their bursting. A copper boiler of six feet diameter must be nine-tenths of an inch thick to be just in equilibrium with this pressure; and the foldered joint will not be able to withstand it, especially in the high temperature to which the water must be heated in order to produce steam of sufficient elasticity. By consulting the table of the elasticity of steam deduced from our experiments mentioned in the preceding article, we see that this temperature must be at least 280\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer. In this heat soft folder is just ready to melt, and has no tenacity; even sterner folder is considerably weakened by it. Accordingly, in a machine erected by Dr Desaguilliers, the workman having loaded the safety-valve a little more than usual to make the engine work more briskly, the boiler burst with a dreadful explosion, and blew up the furnace and adjoining parts of the building as if it had been gunpowder. Mr Savary succeeded pretty well in raising moderate quantities of water to small heights, but could make nothing of deep mines. Many attempts were made, on the mor-\nquis's principle, to strengthen the vessels from within by radiated bars and by hoops, but in vain. Very small boilers or evaporators were then tried, kept red hot, or nearly so, and supplied with a slender stream of water trickling into them; but this afforded no opportunity of making a collection of steam during the refrigeration of the receiver, so as to have a magazine of steam in readiness for the next forcing operation; and the working of such machines was always an employment of great danger and anxiety.\n\nThe only situation in which this machine could be employed with perfect safety, and with some effect, was where the whole lift did not exceed 30 or 35 feet. In this case the greatest part of it was performed by the suction-pipe, and a very manageable pressure was sufficient for the rest. Several machines of this kind were erected in England about the beginning of this century. A very large one was erected at a salt-work in the south of France. Here the water was to be raised no more than 18 feet. The receiver was capacious, and it was occasionally supplied with steam from a small salt-pan constructed on purpose with a cover. The entry of the steam into the receiver merely allowed the water to run out of it by a large valve, which was opened by the hand, and the condensation was produced by the help of a small forcing pump also worked by the hand. In no particular situation as this (and many such may occur in the endless variety of human wants), this is a very powerful engine; and having few moving and rubbing parts, it must be of great durability. This circumstance has occasioned much attention to be given to this first form of the engine, even long after it was supplanted by those of a much better construction. A very ingenious attempt was made very lately to adapt this construction to the uses of the miners. The whole depth of the pit was divided into lifts of 15 feet, in the same manner as is frequently done in pump-machines. In each of these was a suction-pipe 14 feet long, having above it a small receiver like R, about a foot high, and its capacity somewhat greater than that of the pipe. This receiver had a valve at the head of the suction-pipe, and another opening outwards into the little cistern, into which the next suction-pipe above dipped to take in water. Each of these receivers sent up a pipe from its top, which all met in the cover of a large vessel above ground, which was of double the capacity of all the receivers and pipes. This vessel was close on all sides. Another vessel of equal capacity was placed immediately above it, with a pipe from its bottom passing through the cover of the lower vessel and reaching near to its bottom. This upper vessel communicates with the boiler, and constitutes the receiver of the steam-engine. The operation is as follows: The lower vessel is full of water. Steam is admitted into the upper vessel, which expels the air by a valve, and fills the vessel. It is then condensed by cold water. The pressure of the atmosphere would cause it to enter by all the suction-pipes of the different lifts, and press on the surface of the water in the lower receiver, and force it into the upper one. But because each suction-pipe dips in a cistern of water, the air presses this water before it, raises it into each of the little receivers which it fills, and allows the spring of the air (which was formerly in them, but which now passes up into the lower receiver) to force the water out of the lower receiver into the upper one. When this has been completed, the steam is again admitted into the upper receiver. This allows the water to run back into the lower receiver, and the air returns into the small receivers in the pit, and allows the water to run out of each into its proper cistern. By this means the water of each pipe has been raised 15 feet. The operation may thus be repeated continually.\n\nThe contrivance is ingenious, and similar to those which are to be met with in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRAULICS\">hydraulics</a> of Schottus, Sturmius, and other German writers. But the operation must be exceedingly slow; and we imagine that the expense of steam must be great, because it must fill a very large and very cold vessel, which must waste a great portion of it by condensation. We see by some late publications of the very ingenious Mr Blackey, that he is still attempting to maintain the reputation of this machine by some contrivances of this kind; but we imagine that they will be ineffectual, except in some very particular situations.\n\nFor the great defect of the machine, even when we can secure it against all risk of bursting, is the prodigious waste of steam, and consequently of fuel. Daily experience shows, that a few scattered drops of cold water are sufficient for producing an almost instantaneous condensation of a great quantity of steam. Therefore when the steam is admitted into the receiver of Savary's engine, and comes into contact with the cold top and cold water, it is condensed with great rapidity; and the water does not begin to bubble till its surface has become so hot that it condenses no more steam. It may now begin to yield to the pressure of the incumbent steam; but as soon as it descends a little, more of the cold surface of the receiver comes into contact with the steam, and condenses more of it, and the water can descend no farther till this addition of cold surface is heated up to the state of evaporation. This rapid condensation goes on all the while the water is descending. By some experiments frequently repeated by the writer of this article, it appears that no less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ths of the whole steam is useless condensed in this manner, and not more than $\\frac{1}{4}$th is employed in allowing the water to descend by its own weight; and he has reason to think that the portion thus wasted will be considerably greater, if the steam be employed to force the water out of the receiver to any considerable height.\n\nObserve, too, that all this waste must be repeated in every succeeding stroke; for the whole receiver must be cooled again in order to fill itself with water.\n\nMany attempts have been made to diminish this waste; but all to little purpose, because the very filling of the receiver with cold water occasions its sides made to condense a prodigious quantity of steam in the face of this waste exceeding stroke. Mr Blackey has attempted to lessen this waste by using two receivers. In the first was oil; and into this only the steam was admitted. This oil passed to and fro between the two receivers, and never touched the water except in a small surface. But this hardly produced a sensible diminution of the waste: for it must now be observed, that there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for the first cylinder's being cooled to a considerable degree below the boiling point; otherwise, though it will condense much steam, and allow the water to rise into the receiver, there will be a great diminution of the height of suction, unless the vessel be much cooled. This appears plainly\nby inspecting the table of elasticity. Thus, if the vessel be cooled no lower than $180^\\circ$, we should lose one half of the pressure of the atmosphere; if cooled to $120^\\circ$, we should still lose $\\frac{3}{5}$th. The inspection of this table is of great use for understanding and improving this noble machine; and without a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of the elasticity of steam corresponding to its actual heat, we shall never have a notion of the niceties of its operation.\n\nThe rapidity with which the steam is condensed is really astonishing. Experiments have been made on steam-vessels of five feet in diameter and seven feet high; and it has been found, that about four ounces of water, as warm as the human blood, will produce a complete condensation in less than a second; that is, will produce all the condensation that it is capable of producing, leaving an elasticity about one-fifth of the elasticity of the air. In another experiment with the same steam-vessel, no cold water was allowed to get into it, but it was made to communicate by a long pipe four inches in diameter with another vessel immersed in cold water. The condensation was so rapid that the time could not be measured: it certainly did not exceed half a second. Now this condensation was performed by a very trifling surface of contact. Perhaps we may explain it a little in this way: When a mass of steam, in immediate contact with the cold water, is condensed, it leaves a void, into which the adjoining steam instantly expands; and by this expansion its capacity for heat is increased, or it grows cold, that is, abstracts the heat from the steam situated immediately beyond it. And in this expansion and refrigeration it is itself partly condensed or converted into water, and leaves a void, into which the circumjacent steam immediately expands, and produces the same effect on the steam beyond it. And thus it may happen that the abstraction of a small quantity of heat from an inconsiderable mass of steam may produce a condensation which may be very extensive. Did we know the change made in the capacity of steam for heat by a given change of bulk, we should be able to tell exactly what would be the effect of this local actual condensation. But experiment has not yet given us any precise notions on this subject. We think that this rapid condensation to a great distance by a very moderate actual abstraction of heat is a proof that the capacity of steam for heat is prodigiously increased by expansion. We say a very moderate actual abstraction of heat, because very little heat is necessary to raise four ounces of blood-warm water to a boiling temperature, which will unfit it for condensing steam. The remarkable phenomenon of snow and ice produced in the Hungarian machine, when the air condensed in the receiver is allowed to blow through the cock (see PNEUMATICS), shows this to be the case in moist air, that is, in air holding water in a state of chemical solution. We see something very like it in a thunder-storm. A small black cloud sometimes appears in a particular spot, and in a very few seconds spreads over many hundred acres of sky, that is, a precipitation of water goes on with that rapid diffusion. We imagine that this increase of capacity or demand for heat, and the condensation that must ensue if this demand is not supplied, is much more remarkable in pure watery vapours, and that this is a capital distinction of their constitution from vapours dissolved in air.\n\nThe reader must now be so well acquainted with what passes in the steam-vessel, and with the exterior results from it, as readily to comprehend the propriety of the changes which we shall now describe as having been made in the construction and principle of the steam engine.\n\nOf all places in England the tin-mines of Cornwall attempts stood most in need of hydraulic affluence; and Mr Savary was much engaged in projects for draining them by his steam-engine. This made its construction and principles well known among the machinists and engineers of that neighbourhood. Among these were Mr Newcomen, an ironmonger or blacksmith, and Mr Cawley a glazier at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DARTMOUTH\">Dartmouth</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>, who had dabbled much with this machine. Newcomen was a person of some reading, and was in particular acquainted with the person, writings, and projects of his countryman Dr Hooke. There are to be found among Hooke's papers, in the possession of the Royal Society, some notes of observations, for the use of Newcomen his countryman, on Papin's boasted method of transmitting to a great distance the action of a mill by means of pipes. Papin's project was to employ the mill to work two air-pumps of great diameter. The cylinders of these pumps were to communicate by means of pipes with equal cylinders furnished with pistons, in the neighbourhood of a distant mine. These pistons were to be connected, by means of levers, with the piston-rods of the mine. Therefore, when the piston of the air-pump at the mill was drawn up by the mill, the corresponding piston at the side of the mine would be pressed down by the atmosphere, and thus would raise the piston-rod in the mine, and draw the water. It would appear from these notes, that Dr Hooke had diffused Mr Newcomen from erecting a machine on this principle, of which he had exposed the fallacy in several discourses before the Royal Society. One passage is remarkable. \"Could he (meaning Papin) make a speedy vacuum under your second piston, your work is done.\"\n\nIt is highly probable that, in the course of this speculation, it occurred to Mr Newcomen that the vacuum he so much wanted might be produced by steam, and that this gave rise to his new principle and construction of the steam-engine. The specific deferaturum was in Newcomen's mind; and therefore, when Savary's engine appeared, and became known in his neighbourhood many years after, he would readily catch at the help which it promised.\n\nSavary, however, claims the invention as his own; but Switzer, who was personally acquainted with both, is positive that Newcomen was the inventor. By his principles (as a Quaker) being adverse from contention, he was contented to share the honour and the profits with Savary, whose acquaintance at court enabled him to procure the patent in 1705, in which all the three were associated. Posterity has done justice to the modest inventor, and the machine is universally called NEWCOMEN'S.\n\n(A) But if it has been found that the condensation requires more cold water than what is allowed above, and it is suspected that the rapidity of condensing a large volume of steam by the cold surface of a vessel is overrated.\nThe water in the boiler being supposed to be in a state of strong ebullition, and the steam issuing by the safety-valve, let us consider the machine in a state of rest, having both the steam-cock and injection-cock shut. How the resting position or attitude of the machine must be such as appears in sketch, the pump rods preponderating, and the great piston being drawn up to the top of the cylinder. Now open the steam-cock by turning the handle T of the regulator. The steam from the work-boiler will immediately rush in, and flying all over the cylinder, will mix with the air. Much of it will be condensed by the cold surface of the cylinder and piston, and the water produced from it will trickle down the sides, and run off by the eduction-pipe. This condensation and waste of steam will continue till the whole cylinder and piston are made as hot as boiling water. When this happens, the steam will begin to open the snifting valve f, and issue through the pipe; slowly at first and very cloudy, being mixed with much air. The blast at f will grow stronger by degrees, and more transparent, having already carried off the greatest part of the common air which filled the cylinder. We supposed that the water was boiling briskly, so that the steam was issuing by the safety-valve which is in the top of the boiler, and through every crevice. The opening of the steam-cock puts an end to this at once, and it has sometimes happened that the cold cylinder abstracts the steam from the boiler with such astonishing rapidity, that the pressure of the atmosphere has burst up the bottom of the boiler. We may here mention an accident of which we were witnesses, which also shows the immense rapidity of the condensation. The boiler was in a frail shed at the side of the engine-house; a shout of snow from the top of the house fell down and broke through the roof of the shed, and was scattered over the head of the boiler, which was of an oblong or oval shape. In an instant the sides of it were squeezed together by the pressure of the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the manager of the engine perceives that not only the blast at the snifting valve is strong and steady, but that the boiler is now fully supplied with steam of proper strength, appearing by the renewal of the discharge at the safety-valve, he shuts the steam-cock, and opens the injection-cock S by turning its handle V. The pressure of the column of water in the injection-pipe ZS immediately forces some water through the spout R. This coming in contact with the pure vapour which now fills the cylinder, condenses it, and thus makes a partial void, into which the more dilute steam immediately expands, and by expanding collapses (as has been already observed). What remains in the cylinder no longer balances the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the water in the injection cistern, and therefore the water pours rapidly through the hole R by the joint action of the column ZS, and the unbalanced pressure of the atmosphere; at the same time the snifting-valve f, and the eduction-valve h, are shut by the unbalanced pressure of the atmosphere. The velocity of the injection water must therefore rapidly increase, and the jet will dash (if single) against the bottom of the piston, and be scattered through the whole capacity of the cylinder. In a very short space of time, therefore, the condensation of the steam becomes universal, and the elasticity of what remains is almost nothing. The whole pressure...\npressure of the atmosphere is exerted in the upper surface of the piston, while there is hardly any on its under side. Therefore, if the load on the outer end E of the working beam is inferior to this pressure, it must yield to it. The piston P must descend, and the pump piston L must ascend, bringing along with it the water of the mine, and the motion must continue till the great piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder; for it is not like the motion which would take place in a cylinder of air rarefied to the same degree. In this last case, the impelling force would be continually diminished, because the capacity of the cylinder is diminished by the descent of the piston, and the air in it is continually becoming more dense and elastic. The piston would stop at a certain height, where the elasticity of the included air, together with the load at E, would balance the atmospheric pressure on the piston. But when the contents of the cylinder are pure vapour, and the continued stream of injected cold water keeps down its temperature to the same pitch as at the beginning, the elasticity of the remaining steam can never increase by the descent of the piston, nor exceed what corresponds to this temperature. The impelling or accelerating force therefore remains the same, and the descent of the piston will be uniformly accelerated, if there is not an increase of resistance arising from the nature of the work performed by the other end of the beam. This circumstance will come under consideration afterwards, and we need not attend to it at present. It is enough for our present purpose to see, that if the cylinder has been completely purged of common air before the steam-cock was shut, and if none has entered since, the piston will descend to the very bottom of the cylinder. And this may be frequently observed in a good steam-engine, where every part is air-tight. It sometimes happens, by the pit-pump drawing air, or some part of the communication between the two strains giving way, that the piston comes down with such violence as to knock out the bottom of the cylinder with the blow.\n\nThe only observation which remains to be made on the motion of the piston in descending is, that it does not begin at the instant the injection is made. The piston was kept at the top by the preponderancy of the outer end of the working beam, and it must remain there till the difference between the elasticity of the steam below it and the pressure of the atmosphere exceeds this preponderance. There must therefore be a small space of time between the beginning of the condensation and the beginning of the motion. This is very small, not exceeding the third or the fourth part of a second; but it may be very distinctly observed by an attentive spectator. He will see, that the instant the injection cock is opened, the cylinder will sensibly rise upwards a little by the pressure of the air on its bottom. Its whole weight is not nearly equal to this pressure; and instead of its being necessary to support it by a strong floor, we must keep it down by strong jolts loaded by heavy walls. It is usual to frame these joints into the pots which carry the axis of the working-beam, and are therefore loaded with the whole strain of the machine. This rising of the cylinder shows the instantaneous commencement of the condensation; and it is not till after this has been distinctly observed that the piston is seen to start, and begin to descend.\n\nWhen the manager feels the piston as low as he thinks proper, he shuts the injection-cock, and opens the steam-cock. The steam has been accumulating above the water in the boiler during the whole time of the piston's descent, and is now rushing violently through the pipe. The moment, therefore, that the steam-cumstances cock is opened, it rushes violently into the cylinder, having an elasticity greater than that of the air. It therefore immediately blows open the stuffing valve, and allows (at least) the water which had come in by the former injection, and what arose from the condensed steam, to descend by its own weight through the eduction pipe d e g h to open the valve A, and to run out into the well. And we must easily see that this water is boiling hot; for while lying in the bottom of the cylinder, it will condense steam till it acquires this temperature, and therefore cannot run down till it condenses no more. There is still a waft of steam at its first admission, in order to heat the inside of the cylinder and the injected water to the boiling temperature; but the space being small, and the whole being already very warm, this is very soon done; and when things are properly constructed, little more steam is wanted than what will warm the cylinder; for the eduction pipe receives the injection water even during the descent of the piston, and it is therefore removed pretty much out of the way of the steam.\n\nThis first puff of the entering steam is of great service; it drives out of the cylinder the vapour which it finds there. This is seldom pure watery vapour: all puff of enter water contains a quantity of air in a state of chemical union. The union is but feeble, and a boiling heat is sufficient for disengaging the greatest part of it by increasing its elasticity. It may also be disengaged by simply removing the external pressure of the atmosphere. This is clearly seen when we expose a glass of water in an exhausted receiver. Therefore the small space below the piston contains watery vapour mixed with all the air which had been disengaged from the water in the boiler by ebullition, and all that was separated from the injection water by the diminution of external pressures. All this is blown out of the cylinder by the first puff of steam. We may observe in this place, that waters differ exceedingly in the quantity of air which they hold in a state of solution. All spring water contains much of it; and water newly brought up from deep mines contains a great deal more, because the solution was aided in these situations by great pressures. Such waters sparkle when poured into a glass. It is therefore of great consequence to the good performance of a steam-engine to use water containing little air, both in the engine and in the injection-cistern. The water of running brooks is preferable to all others, and the freer it is from any saline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> it generally contains steam-leafs air. Such engines as are so unfortunately situated, that they are obliged to employ the very water which employed they have brought up from great depths, are found contain greatly inferior in their performance to others. The little air collected below the piston greatly diminishes the accelerating force, and the expulsion of such a quantity requires a long-continued blast of the best steam at the beginning of every stroke. It is advisable to keep such water in a large shallow pond for a long while before using it.\n\nLet us now consider the state of the piston. It is evident that it will start or begin to rise the moment piston rises.\nthe steam-cock is opened; for at that instant the excess of atmospheric pressure, by which it was kept down in opposition to the preponderance of the outer end of the beam, is diminished. The piston is therefore dragged upwards, and it will rise even although the steam which is admitted be not so elastic as common air. Suppose the mercury in the barometer to stand at 30 inches, and that the preponderance at the outer end of the beam is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th of the pressure of the air on the piston, the piston will not rise if the elasticity of the steam is not equal to \\( \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} \\), that is, to 26.7 inches nearly; but if it is just this quantity, the piston will rise as fast as this steam can be supplied through the steam-pipe, and the velocity of its ascent depends entirely on the velocity of this supply. This observation is of great importance; and it does not seem to have occurred to the mathematicians, who have paid most attention to the mechanism of the motion of this engine. In the mean time, we may clearly see that the entry of the steam depends chiefly on the counter weight at E: for suppose there was none, steam no stronger than air would not enter the cylinder at all; and if the steam be stronger, it will enter only by the excess of its strength. Writers on the steam-engine (and even some of great reputation) familiarly speak of the steam giving the piston a push: But this is scarcely possible. During the rise of the piston the stuffing valve is never observed to blow; and we have not heard any well-attested accounts of the piston-chains ever being slackened by the upward pressure of the steam, even at the very beginning of the stroke. During the rising of the piston the steam is (according to the common conception and manner of speaking) sucked in, in the same way that air is sucked into a common syringe or pump when we draw up the piston; for in the steam-engine the piston is really drawn up by the counter weight. But it is still more sucked in, and requires a more copious supply, for another reason. As the piston descended only in consequence of the inside of the cylinder's being sufficiently cooled to condense the steam, this cooled surface must again be presented to the steam during the rise of the piston, and must condense steam a second time. The piston cannot rise another inch till the part of the cylinder which the piston has already quitted has been warmed up to the boiling point, and steam must be expended in this warming. The inner surface of the cylinder is not only of the heat of boiling water while the piston rises, but is also perfectly dry; for the film of water left on it by the ascending piston must be completely evaporated, otherwise it will be condensing steam. That the quantity thus wasted is considerable, appears by the experiments of Mr Beighton. He found that five pints of water were boiled off in a minute, and produced 16 strokes of an engine whose cylinder contained 113 gallons of 282 inches each; and he thence concluded that steam was 2886 times rarer than water. But in no experiment made with scrupulous care on the expansion of boiling water does it appear that the density of steam exceeds \\( \\frac{1}{10,000} \\)th of the density of water. Desaguliers says that it is above 14,000 times rarer than water. We have frequently attempted to measure the weight of steam which filled a very light vessel, which held 12,600 grains of water, and found it always less than one grain; so that we have no doubt of its being much more than 10,000 times rarer than water. This being the case, we may safely suppose that the number of gallons of steam, instead of being 16 times 113, were nearly five times as much; and that only \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th was employed in allowing the piston to rise, and the remaining \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths were employed to warm the cylinder. But no direct experiment shows so great an expansion of water when converted into steam at 212\u00b0. Mr Watt never found it under the pressure of the air more than 1800 times rarer than water.\n\nThe moving force during the ascent of the piston must be considered as resulting chiefly, if not solely, from the preponderating weight of the piton-rods. The office of this is to return the steam-piston to the top of the cylinder, where it may again be pressed down by the air, and make another working stroke by raising the pump rods. But the counter-weight at E has another service to perform in this use of the engine; namely, to return the pump pistons into their places at the bottom of their respective working barrels, in order that they also may make a working stroke. This requires force independent of the friction and inertia of the moving parts; for each piston must be pushed down through the water in the barrel, which must rise through the piston with a velocity whose proportion to the velocity of the piston is the same with that of the bulk of the piston to the bulk of the perforation through which the water rises through the piston. It is enough at present to mention this in general terms: we shall consider it more particularly afterwards, when we come to calculate the performance of the engine, and to deduce from our acquired knowledge maxims of construction and improvement.\n\nFrom this general consideration of the ascent of the piston, we may see that the motion differs greatly from that of the descent. It can hardly be supposed to accelerate, even if the steam in the cylinder were in a moment annihilated. For the resistance to the descent of the piston is the same with the weight of the column of water, which would cause it to flow through the box of the pump piston with the velocity with which it really rises through it, and must therefore increase as the square of that velocity increases; that is, as the square of the velocity of the piston increases. Independent of friction, therefore, the velocity of descent through the water must soon become a maximum, and the motion become uniform. We shall see by and by, that in such a pump as is generally used this will happen in less than the tenth part of a second. The friction of the pump will diminish this velocity a little, and retard the time of its attaining uniformity. But, on the other hand, the supply of steam which is necessary for this motion, being susceptible of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> from its previous motion, and depending entirely on the briefness of the ebullition, an almost instantaneous stop is put to acceleration.\n\nAccordingly, any person who observes with attention the working of a steam-engine, will see that the rise of the piston and descent of the pump-rods is extremely uniform, whereas the working stroke is very sensibly accelerated. Before quitting this part of the subject, and lest it should afterwards escape our recollection, we may observe, that the counter-weight is different during the two motions of the pump-rods. While the machine is making a working stroke, it is lifting not only the lower pump-rods,\nlumn of water in the pump, but the absolute weight of the pistons and piston-rods also; but while the pump-rods are descending, there is a diminution of the counter-weight by the whole weight lost by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> of the rod in water. The wooden rods which are generally used, soaked in water, and joined by iron straps, are heavier, and but a little heavier, than water, and they are generally about one-third of the bulk of the water in the pumps.\n\nThese two motions complete the period of the operation; and the whole may be repeated by shutting the steam-cock and opening the injection-cock whenever the piston has attained the proper height. We have been very minute in our attention to the different circumstances, that the reader may have a distinct notion of the state of the moving forces in every period of the operation. It is by no means sufficient that we know in general that the injection of cold water makes a void which allows the air to press down the piston, and that the readmission of the steam allows the piston to rise again. This lumping and slovenly way of viewing it has long prevented even the philosopher from seeing the defects of the construction, and the methods of removing them.\n\nWe now see the great difference between Savary's and Newcomen's engine, in respect of principle. Savary's was really an engine which raised water by the force of steam; but Newcomen's raises water entirely by the pressure of the atmosphere, and steam is employed merely as the most expeditious method of producing a void, into which the atmospheric pressure may impel the first mover of his machine. The elasticity of the steam is not the first mover.\n\nWe see also the great superiority of this new machine. We have no need of steam of great and dangerous elasticity; and we operate by means of very moderate heats, and consequently with much smaller quantities of fuel; and there is no bounds to the power of this machine. How deep soever a mine may be, a cylinder may be employed of such dimensions that the pressure of the air on its piston may exceed in any degree the weight of the column of water to be raised. And lastly, this form of the machine renders it applicable to almost every mechanical purpose; because a skilful mechanic can readily find a method of converting the reciprocating motion of the working beam into a motion of any kind which may suit his purpose. Savary's engine could hardly admit of such an immediate application, and seems almost restricted to raising water.\n\nInventions improve by degrees. This engine was first offered to the public in 1705. But many difficulties occurred in the execution, which were removed one by one; and it was not till 1712 that the engine seemed to give confidence in its efficacy. The most exact and unremitting attention of the manager was required to the precise moment of opening and shutting the cocks; and neglect might frequently be ruinous, by beating out the bottom of the cylinder, or allowing the piston to be wholly drawn out of it. Stops were contrived to prevent both of these accidents; then strings were used to connect the handles of the cocks with the beam, so that they should be turned whenever it was in certain positions. These were gradually changed and improved into detents and catches of different shapes; at last, in 1717, Mr Beighton, a very ingenious and well-informed artist, simplified the whole of these subordinate movements, and brought the machine into the form in which it has continued, without the smallest material change, to the present day. We shall now describe one of these improved engines, copying almost exactly the drawings and description given by Boulton in his Hydrodynamique; these being by far the most accurate and perspicuous of any that have been published.\n\nFig. 8. No. 1, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of the boiler cylinder, and all the parts necessary for turning the cocks. Fig. 8. No. 2, is a vertical section of the same; and the same pieces of both are marked with the same letters of reference.\n\nThe rod X of the piston P is suspended from the arch of the working-beam, as was represented in the preceding sketch (fig. 7). An upright bar of timber FG is also seen hanging by a chain. This is suspended from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> arch of the beam, as may be seen also in the sketch at \u03c6. The bar is called the plug-beam; and it must rise and fall with the piston, but with a slower motion. The use of this plug-beam is to give motion to the different pieces which turn the cocks.\n\nThe steam-pipe K is of one piece with the bottom of the cylinder, and rises within it an inch or two, to prevent any of the cold injection water from falling into the boiler. The lower extremity Z of the steam-pipe penetrates the head of the boiler, projecting a little way. A flat plate of brass, in shape resembling a racket or battledore, called the regulator, applies itself exactly to the whole circumference of the steam-pipe, and completely excludes the steam from the cylinder. Being moveable round an upright axis, which is represented by the dotted lines at the side of the steam-pipe in the profile, it may be turned aside by the handle i, no. 1. The profile shows in the section of this plate a protuberance in the middle. This rests on a strong flat spring, which is fixed below it athwart the mouth of the steam-pipe. This spring presses it strongly towards the steam-pipe, causing it to apply very close; and this knob slides along the spring, while the regulator turns to the right or left.\n\nWe have said that the injection-water is furnished from a cistern placed above the cylinder. When the cistern cannot be supplied by pipes from some more elevated source, its water is raised by the machine itself. A small lifting pump i k (fig. 7), called the jack-head or jaquette, is worked by a rod y, suspended from a concentric arch \u03b3 near the outer end of the working beam. This forces a small portion of the pit water along the rising pipe i LM into the injection cistern.\n\nIn figure 8. No. 1, and 2, the letters Q M 3' represent the pipe which brings down the water from the injection cistern. This pipe has a cock at R to open or shut the passage of this water. It sprouts through the jet 3', and dashing against the bottom of the piston, it is dispersed into drops, and scattered through the whole capacity of the cylinder, so as to produce a rapid condensation of the steam.\n\nAn upright post A may be observed in the perspective view of the cylinder, &c. This supports one end B of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> iron axis BC. The end C is supported by a similar post, of which the place only is marked by the dotted lines \u0394, that the pieces connected...\nted with this axis may not be hid by it. A kind of stirrup \\(a b c d\\) hangs from this axis, supported by the hooks \\(a\\) and \\(d\\). This stirrup is crossed near the bottom by a round bolt or bar \\(e\\), which passes through the eyes or rings that are at the ends of the horizontal fork \\(h f g\\), whose long tail \\(h\\) is double, receiving between its branches the handle \\(i\\) of the regulator. It is plain from this construction, that when the stirrup is made to vibrate round the horizontal axis \\(BC\\), on which it hangs freely by its hooks, the bolt \\(e\\) must pull or push the long fork \\(h f g\\) backwards and forwards horizontally, and by so doing will move the regulator round its axis by means of the handle \\(i\\). Both the tail of the fork and the handle of the regulator are pierced with several holes, and a pin is put through them which unites them by a joint. The motion of the handle may be increased or diminished by choosing for the joint a hole near to the axis or remote from it; and the exact position at which the regulator is to stop on both sides is determined by pins stuck in the horizontal bar on which the end of the handle appears to rest.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> motion of the regulator to the right and left is produced as follows: There is fixed to the axis \\(BC\\) a piece of iron \\(k l\\), called the \\(Y\\), on account of its resemblance to that letter of the alphabet inverted. The stalk \\(o\\) carries a heavy lump \\(p\\) of lead or iron; and a long leather strap \\(q p r\\) is fastened to \\(p\\) by the middle, and the two ends are fastened to the beam above it, in such a manner that the lump may be alternately raised and held up to the right and left of the perpendicular. By adjusting the length of the two parts of the strap, the \\(Y\\) may be stopped in any desired position. The two claws \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) extend out from each other, and from the line of the stalk, and they are of such length as to reach the horizontal bolt \\(e\\), which crosses the stirrup below, but not to reach the bottom of the fork \\(h f g\\). Now suppose the stirrup hanging perpendicularly, and the stalk of the \\(Y\\) also held perpendicular; carry it a little outward from the cylinder, and then let it go. It will tumble farther out by its weight, without affecting the stirrup till the claw \\(l\\) strikes the horizontal bolt \\(e\\), and then it pushes the stirrup and the fork towards the cylinder, and opens the regulator. It sets it in motion with a smart jerk, which is an effectual way of overcoming the cohesion and friction of the regulator with the mouth of the steam-pipe. This push is adjusted to a proper length by the strap \\(q p\\), which stops the \\(Y\\) when it has gone far enough. If we now take hold of the stalk of the \\(Y\\), and move it up to the perpendicular, the width between its claws is such as to permit this motion, and something more, without affecting the stirrup. But when pushed still nearer to the cylinder, it tumbles towards it by its own weight, and then the claw \\(k\\) strikes the bolt \\(e\\), and drives the stirrup and fork in the opposite direction, till the lump \\(p\\) is caught by the strap \\(r p\\), now stretched to its full length, while \\(q p\\) hangs slack. Thus by the motion of the \\(Y\\) the regulator is opened and shut. Let us now see how the motion of the \\(Y\\) is produced by the machine itself. To the horizontal axis \\(BC\\) are attached two spanners or handles \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). The spanner \\(m\\) passes through a long slit in the plug-beam, and is at liberty to move upwards or downwards by its motion round the axis \\(BC\\). A pin \\(z\\) which goes through the plug-beam catches hold of \\(m\\) when the beam rises along with the piston; and the pin is so placed, that when the beam is within an inch or two of its highest rise, the pin has lifted \\(m\\) and thrown the stalk of the \\(Y\\) past the perpendicular. It therefore tumbles over with great force, and gives a smart blow to the fork, and immediately shuts the regulator. By this motion the spanner \\(m\\) is removed out of the neighbourhood of the plug-beam. But the spanner \\(n\\), moving along with it in the same direction, now comes into the way of the pins of the plug-beam. Therefore, when the piston descends again by the condensation of the steam in the cylinder, a pin marked \\(\\omega\\) in the side of the plug-beam catches hold of the tail of the spanner \\(n\\), and by pressing it down raises the lump on the stalk of the \\(Y\\) till it passes the perpendicular, and it then falls down, outwards from the cylinder, and the claw \\(l\\) again drives the fork in the direction \\(h i\\), and opens the steam valve. This opening and shutting of the steam valve is executed in the precise moment that is proper, by placing the pins \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\omega\\) at a proper height of the plug-beam. For this reason, it is pierced through with a great number of holes, that the places of these pins may be varied at pleasure. This, and a proper curvature of the spanners \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), make the adjustment as nice as we please.\n\nThe injection cock \\(R\\) is managed in a similar manner. On its key may be observed a forked arm \\(s t\\), like a crab's claw; at a little distance above it is the gudgeon or axis \\(u\\) of a piece \\(y u z\\), called the hammer or the \\(F\\), from its resemblance to that letter. It has a lump of metal \\(y\\) at one end, and a spear \\(u s\\) projects from its middle, and passes between the claws \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) of the arm of the injection-cock. The hammer \\(y\\) is held up by a notch in the under side of a wooden lever \\(DE\\), moveable round the center \\(D\\), and supported at a proper height by a string \\(E\\), made fast to the joint above it.\n\nSuppose the injection-cock shut, and the hammer in the position represented in the figure. A pin \\(\\beta\\) of the plug-frame rises along with the piston, and catching hold of the detent \\(DE\\), raises it, and disengages the hammer \\(y\\) from its notch. This immediately falls down, and strikes a board \\(L\\) put in the way to stop it. The spear \\(u s\\) takes hold of the claw \\(t\\), and forces it aside towards \\(x\\), and opens the injection-cock. The piston immediately descends, and along with it the plug-frame. During its descent the pin \\(\\beta\\) meets with the tail \\(u z\\) of the hammer, which is now raised considerably above the level, and brings it down along with it, raising the lump \\(y\\), and gradually shutting the injection-cock, because the spear takes hold of the claw \\(s\\) of its arm. When the beam has come to its lowest situation, the hammer is again engaged in the notch of the detent \\(DE\\), and supported by it till the piston again reaches the top of the cylinder.\n\nIn this manner the motions of the injection cock are also adjusted to the precise moment that is proper for them. The different pins are so placed in the plug-frame, that the steam-cock may be completely shut before the injection-cock is opened. The inherent motion of the machine will give a small addition to the ascent of the piston without expending steam all the while; and by leaving the steam rather less elastic than before, the subsequent descent of the piston is promoted. There was a considerable propriety in the gradual shutting...\nting of the injection-cock. For after the first dash of the cold water against the bottom of the piston, the condensation is nearly complete, and very little more water is needed; but a continual accession of some is absolutely necessary for completing the condensation, as the capacity of the cylinder diminishes, and the water warms which is already injected.\n\nIn this manner the motion of the machine will be repeated as long as there is a supply of steam from the boiler, and of water from the injection cistern, and a discharge procured for what has been injected. We proceed to consider how far these conditions also are provided by the machine itself.\n\nThe injection cistern is supplied with water by the jackhead pump, as we have already observed. From this source all the parts of the machine receive their respective supplies. In the first place, a small branch 13, 13, is taken off from the injection-pipe immediately below the cistern, and conducted to the top of the cylinder, where it is furnished with a cock. The spout is so adjusted, that no more runs from it than what will keep a constant supply of a foot of water above the piston to keep it tight. Every time the piston comes to the top of the cylinder, it brings this water along with it, and the surplus of its evaporation and leakage runs off by a waste-pipe 14, 14. This water necessarily becomes almost boiling hot, and it was thought proper to employ its surplus for supplying the waste of the boiler. This was accordingly practised for some time. But Mr Beighton improved this economical thought, by supplying the boiler from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>-pipe, 2, 2, the water of which must be still hotter than that above the piston. This contrivance required attention to many circumstances, which the reader will understand by considering the perspective and profile. The education-pipe comes out of the bottom of the cylinder at 1 with a perpendicular part, which bends sidewise below, and is shut at the extremity 1. A deep cup 5 communicates with it, holding a metal valve nicely fitted to it by grinding, like the key of a cock. To secure its being always air-tight, a slender stream of water trickles into it from a branch 6 of the waste-pipe from the top of the cylinder. The education-pipe branches off at 2, and goes down to the hot well, where it turns up, and is covered with a valve. In the perspective view may be observed an upright pipe 4, 4, which goes through the head of the boiler, and reaches to within a few inches of its bottom. This pipe is called the feeder, and rises about three or four feet above the boiler. It is open at both ends, and has a branch 3, 3, communicating with the bottom of the cup 5, immediately above the metal valve, and also a few inches below the level of the entry 2 of the education-pipe. This communicating branch has a cock by which its passage may be diminished at pleasure. Now suppose the steam in the boiler to be very strong, it will cause the boiling water to rise in the feeding pipe above 3, and coming along this branch, to rise also in the cup 5, and run over. But the height of this cup above the surface of the water in the boiler is such, that the steam is never strong enough to produce this effect. Therefore, on the contrary, any water that may be in the cup 5 will run off by the branch 3, 3, and go down into the boiler by the feeding pipe.\n\nThese things being understood, let us suppose a quantity of injected water lying at the bottom of the Steama-cylinder. It will run into the education-pipe, fill the crooked branch 1, 1, and open the valve in the bottom of the cup (its weight being supported by a wire hanging from a flender spring), and it will fill the cup to the lowest con-level of the entry 2 of the education-pipe, and then trivance flow along 3, 3, and supply the boiler by the feeder 4, 4. What more water runs in at 1 will now go along the education pipe 2, 2, to the hot well. By properly adjusting the cock on the branch 3, 3, the boiler may be supplied as fast as the waste in steam requires. This is a most ingenious contrivance, and does great honour to Mr Beighton. It is not, however, of much importance. The small quantity which the boiler requires may be immediately taken even from a cold cistern, without sensibly diminishing the production of steam: for the quantity of heat necessary for raising the sensible heat of cold water to the boiling temperature is small, when compared with the quantity of heat which must then be combined with it in order to convert the water into steam. For the heat expended in boiling off a cubic foot of water is about five times as much as would bring it to a boiling heat from the temperature of 55\u00b0. No difference can be observed in the performance of such engines, and of those which have their boilers supplied from a brook. It has, however, the advantage of being purged of air; and when an engine must derive all its supplies from pit water, the water from the education-pipe is vastly preferable to that from the top of the cylinder.\n\nWe may here observe, that many writers (among them the Abb\u00e9 Boffet), in their descriptions of the steam-engine, have drawn the branch of communication 3, 3, from the feeding-pipe to a part of the crooked pipe 1, 1, lying below the valve in the cup 5. But this is quite erroneous; for, in this case, when the injection is made into the cylinder, and a vacuum produced, the water from the boiler would immediately rush up through the pipes 4, 3, and spout up into the cylinder: so would the external air coming in at the top of the feeder.\n\nThis contrivance has also enabled us to form some judgement of the internal state of the engine during the absence of performance. Mr Beighton paid a minute attention to form some the situation of the water in the feeders and education, judgement of the internal state of the pipe of an engine, which seems to have been one of the internal state which has yet been erected. It was lifting a co of the column of water whose weight was four-sevenths of the fine during prelude of the air on its piston, and made 16 strokes, of the performance, fix feet each, in a minute. This is acknowledged by all to be a very great performance of an engine of this form. He concluded that the elasticity of the steam in the cylinder was never more than one-tenth greater or less than the elasticity of the air. The water in the feeder never rose more than three feet and a half above the surface of the boiling water, even though it was now lighter by 1/7th than cold water. The education-pipe was only four feet and a half long (vertically), and yet it always discharged the injection water completely; and allowed some to pass into the feeder. This could not be if the steam was much more than one-tenth weaker than air. By grasping this pipe in his hand during the rise of the piston, he could guess very well whereabouts the surface of the hot water in it rested during the motion, and he never found it supported so high as four feet. Therefore the steam in the cylinder had at least eight-ninths of\nof the elasticity of the air. Mr Buat, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of an engine which is erected at Montrelais, in France, by an English engineer, and has always been considered as the pattern in that country, finds it necessary to suppose a much greater variation in the strength of the steam, and says, that it must have been one-fifth stronger and one-fifth weaker than common air. But this engine has not been nearly so perfect. Its lift was not more than one-half of the pressure of the atmosphere, and it made but nine strokes in a minute.\u2014At W is a valve covering the mouth of a small pipe, and surrounded with a cup containing water to keep it air-tight. This allows the air to escape which had been extricated from the water of half injection. It is driven out by the first strong puff of steam which is admitted into the cylinder, and makes a noise in its exit. The valve is therefore called the fitting-valve.\n\nTo finish our description, we observe, that besides the safety valve g (called the PUPPET CLACK), which is loaded with about 3 pounds on the square inch (though the engine will work very well with a load of 1 or 2 pounds), there is another DISCHARGER 10,10, having a clack at its extremity supported by a cord. Its use is to discharge the steam without doors, when the machine gives over working. There is also a pipe SI near the bottom of the boiler, by which it may be emptied when it needs repairs or cleaning.\n\nThere are two small pipes II,II, and 12,12, with cocks called GAGE-PIPES. The first descends to within two inches of the surface of the water in the boiler, and the second goes about 2 inches below that surface. If both cocks emit steam, the water is too low, and requires a recruit. If neither give steam, it is too high, and there is not sufficient room above it for a collection of steam. Lastly, there is a filling pipe Q, by which the boiler may be filled when the machine is to be let to work.\n\nThe engine has continued in this form for many years. The only remarkable change introduced has been the manner of placing the boiler. It is no longer placed below the cylinder, but at one side, and the steam is introduced by a pipe from the top of the boiler into a flat box immediately below the cylinder. The use of this box is merely to lodge the regulator, and give room for its motions. This has been a very considerable improvement. It has greatly reduced the height of the building. This was formerly a tower. The wall which supported the beam could hardly be built with sufficient strength for withstanding the violent shocks which were repeated without ceasing; and the buildings seldom lasted more than a very few years. But the boiler is now set up in an adjoining shed, and the gudgeons of the main beam rest on the top of upright pots, which are framed into the joints which support the cylinder. Thus the whole moving parts of the machine are contained in one compact frame of carpentry, and have little or no connection with the flight walls of the building, which is merely a cage to hold the machine, and protect it from the weather.\n\nIt is now time to inquire what is to be expected from this machine, and to ascertain the most advantageous proportion between the moving power and the load that is to be laid on the machine.\n\nIt may be considered as a great pulley, and is indeed sometimes so constructed, the arches at the ends of the working beam being completed to a circle. It must be unequally loaded that it may move. It is loaded, during the working stroke, by the pressure of the atmosphere on the piston side, and by the column of water to be raised and the pump-gear on the pump side.\u2014During the returning stroke it is loaded, on the piston side, by a small part of the atmospheric pressure, and on the pump side by the pump gear acting as a counter weight. The load during the working stroke must therefore consist of the column of water to be raised and this counter weight. The performance of the machine is to be measured only by the quantity of water raised in a given time to a given height. It varies, therefore, in the joint proportion of the weight of the column of water in the pumps, and the number of strokes made by the machine in a minute. Each stroke consists of two parts, which we have called the working and the returning stroke. It does not, therefore, depend simply on the velocity of the working stroke and the quantity of water raised by it. If this were all that is to be attended to, we know that the weight of the column of water should be nearly 3/4ths of the pressure of the atmosphere, this being the proportion which gives the maximum in the common pulley. But the time of the returning stroke is a necessary part of the whole time elapsed, and therefore the velocity of the returning stroke equally merits attention. This is regulated by the counter weight. The number of strokes per minute does not give an immediate proof of the goodness of the engine. A small load of water and a great counter weight will ensure this, because these conditions will produce a brisk motion in both directions.\u2014The proper adjustment of the pressure of the atmosphere on the piston, the column of water to be raised, and the counter weight, is a problem of very great difficulty; and mathematicians have not turned much of their attention to the subject, although it is certainly the most interesting question that practical mechanics affords them.\n\nMr Boulton has solved it very shortly and simply, upon Mr Boulton's supposition, that the working and returning stroke should be made in equal times. This, indeed, is generally aimed at in the erection of these machines, and they are not reckoned to be well arranged if it be otherwise. We doubt of the propriety of the maxim. Supposing, however, this condition for the present, we may compute the loadings of the two ends of the beam as follows. Let \\(a\\) be the length of the inner arm of the working beam, or that by which the great piston is supported. Let \\(b\\) be the outer arm carrying the pump rods, and let \\(W\\) be a weight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to all the load which is laid on the machine. Let \\(c^2\\) be the area of the piston; let \\(H\\) be the height of a column of water having \\(c^2\\) for its base, and being equal in weight to the pressure exerted by the steam on the under side of the piston; and let \\(h\\) be the pressure of the atmosphere on the same area, or the height of a column of water of equal weight. It is evident that both strokes will be performed in equal times, if \\(h \\cdot c^2 - W \\cdot b\\) be equal to \\((h - H) \\cdot c^2 \\cdot a + W \\cdot b\\). The first of these quantities is the energy of the machine during the working stroke, and the second expresses the similar energy during the returning stroke. This equation gives us\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{2 \\cdot h \\cdot c^2 \\cdot a - H \\cdot c^2 \\cdot a}{2 \\cdot b} = \\frac{(2 \\cdot h - H) \\cdot c^2 \\cdot a}{2 \\cdot b}.\n\\]\n\nIf\nwe suppose the arms of the lever equal and $H = h$, we have $W = \\frac{h}{2}$; that is, the whole weight of the outer end of the beam should be half the pressure of the air on the great piston. This is nearly the usual practice; and the engineers express it by saying, that the engine is loaded with seven or eight pounds on the square inch. This has been found to be nearly the most advantageous load. This way of expressing the matter would do well enough, if the maxim were not founded on erroneous notions, which hinder us from seeing the state of the machine, and the circumstances on which its improvement depends. The piston bears a pressure of 15 pounds, it is said, on the square inch, if the vacuum below it be perfect; but as this is far from being the case, we must not load it above the power of its vacuum, which very little exceeds eight pounds. But this is very far from the truth. When the cylinder is tight, the vacuum is not more than $\\frac{1}{15}$th deficient, when the cylinder is cooled by the injection to the degree that is every day practicable, and the piston really bears during its descent a pressure very near to 14 pounds on the inch. The load must be diminished, not on account of the imperfect vacuum, but to give the machine a reasonable motion. We must consider not only the moving force, but also the quantity of matter to be put in motion. This is so great in the steam-engine, that even if it were balanced, that is, if there were suspended on the piston arm a weight equal to the whole column of water and the counter weight, the full pressure of the atmosphere on the steam piston would not make it move twice as fast as it does.\n\nThis equation by Mr Boffin is moreover essentially faulty in another respect. The W in the first member is not the same with the W in the second. In the first it is the column of water to be raised, together with the counter weight. In the second it is the counter weight only. Nor is the quantity H the same in both cases, as is most evident. The proper equation for ensuring the equal duration of the two strokes may be had in the following manner. Let it be determined by experiment what portion of the atmospheric pressure is exerted on the great piston during its descent. This depends on the remaining elasticity of the steam. Suppose it $\\frac{c}{a}$ths: this we may express by $a \\cdot b$, $a$ being $\\frac{c}{a}$ths. Let it also be determined by experiment what portion of the atmospheric pressure on the piston remains unbalanced by the steam below it during its ascent. Suppose this $\\frac{c}{a}$ths, we may express this by $b \\cdot h$. Then let W be the weight of the column of water to be raised, and c the counter weight. Then, if the arms of the beam are equal, we have the energy during the working stroke $= a \\cdot h - W - c$, and during the returning stroke it is $= c - b \\cdot h$. Therefore $c - b \\cdot h = a \\cdot h - W - c$; and $c = \\frac{h(a + b) - W}{2}$; which, on the above supposition of the values of $a$ and $b$, gives us $c = \\frac{h - W}{2}$. We shall make some use of this equation afterwards; but it affords us no information concerning the most advantageous proportion of $h$ and W, which is the material point.\n\nWe must consider this matter in another way: And furthering the that we may not involve ourselves in unnecessary difficulties, let us make the case as simple as possible, and suppose the arms of the working-beam to be of equal length.\n\nWe shall first consider the adjustment of things at the outer end of the beam.\n\nSince the sole use of the steam is to give room for the adjustment of the atmospheric pressure by its rapid condensation, it is admitted into the cylinder only to allow the things at the piston to rise again, but without giving it any impetus at the end of the pulse. The pump-rods must therefore be returned to beam con- the bottom of the working barrels by means of a presidered ponderancy at the outer end of the beam. It may be the weight of the pump-rods themselves, or may be considered as making part of this weight. A weight at the end of the beam will not operate on the rods which are suspended there by chains, and it must therefore be attached to the rods themselves, but above their respective pump-barrels, so that it may not lose part of its efficacy by immersion in the water. We may consider the whole under the notion of the pump-gear, and call it p. Its office is to depress the pump-rods with sufficient velocity, by overcoming the resistances arising from the following causes:\n\n1. From the inertia of the beams and all the parts of the apparatus which are in motion during the descent of the pump-rods.\n2. From the loss of weight sustained by the immersion of the pump-rods in water.\n3. From the friction of all the pistons and the weight of the plug-frame.\n4. From the resistance to the piston's motion, arising from the velocity which must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the water in passing through the descending pistons.\n\nThe sum of all these resistances is equal to the pressure of some weight (as yet unknown), which we may call m.\n\nWhen the pump-rods are brought up again, they bring along with them a column of water, whose weight we may call w.\n\nIt is evident that the load which must be overcome by the pressure of the atmosphere on the steam piston consists of w and p. Let this load be called L, and the pressure of the air be called P.\n\nIf p be L, no water will be raised; if p be 0, the rods will not descend: therefore there is some intermediate value of p which will produce the greatest effect.\n\nIn order to discover this, let g be the fall of a heavy body in a second.\n\nThe descending mass is p: but it does not descend with its full weight; because it is overcoming a set of resistances which are equivalent to a weight m, and the moving force is $p - m$. In order to discover the space through which the rods will descend in a second, when urged by the force $p - m$ (supposed constant, notwithstanding the increase of velocity, and consequently of m), we must institute this proportion $p : p - m = g : g(p - m)$.\n\nThe fourth term of this analogy is the space required.\n\nLet t be the whole time of the descent in seconds. Then $t^2 : t^2 = \\frac{g(p - m)}{p} : \\frac{t^2 g(p - m)}{p}$. This last term is\nis the whole descent or length of the stroke accomplished in the time \\( t \\).\n\nThe weight of the column of water, which has now got above the piston, is \\( w = L - p \\). This must be lifted in the next working stroke through the space \\( \\frac{t^2 g (p - m)}{p} \\). Therefore the performance of the engine must be \\( \\frac{t^2 g (p - m) (L - p)}{p} \\).\n\nThat this may be the greatest possible, we must consider \\( p \\) as the variable quantity, and make the fluxion of the fraction \\( \\frac{p - m \\times L - p}{p} = 0 \\).\n\nThis will be found to give us \\( p = \\sqrt{Lm} \\); that is, the counter weight or preponderancy of the outer end of the beam is \\( \\frac{\\rho}{\\sqrt{Lm}} \\).\n\nThis gives us a method of determining \\( m \\) experimentally. We can discover by actual measurement the quantity \\( L \\) in any engine, it being equal to the unbalanced weights on the beam and the weight of the water in the pumps. Then \\( m = \\frac{\\rho^2}{L} \\).\n\nAlso we have the weight of the column of water \\( = L - p = L - \\sqrt{Lm} \\).\n\nWhen therefore we have determined the load which is to be on the outer end of the beam during the working stroke, it must be distributed into two parts, which have the proportion of \\( \\sqrt{Lm} \\) to \\( L - \\sqrt{Lm} \\). The first is the counter weight, and the second is the weight of the column of water.\n\nIf \\( m \\) is a fraction of \\( L \\), such as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALIQUOT_PART\">aliquot part</a> of it; that is, if\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{L}{1}, \\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{3}, \\frac{L}{4}, \\frac{L}{5}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe circumstance which is commonly objected to us by local considerations is the quantity of water, and the depth from which it is to be raised; that is, \\( w \\); and it will be convenient to determine everything in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to this.\n\nWe saw that \\( w = L - \\sqrt{Lm} \\). This gives us \\( L = \\frac{w + m^2}{4} + \\frac{m}{2} + w \\), and the counter weight \\( p = \\frac{w + m^2}{4} + \\frac{m}{2} \\).\n\nHaving thus ascertained that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the load on the outer end of the beam which produces the greatest effect, we come now to consider what proportion of moving force we must apply, so that it may be employed to the best advantage, or so that any expense of power may produce the greatest performance. It will be so much the greater as the work done is greater, and the power employed is less; and will therefore be properly measured by the quotient of the work done divided by the power employed.\n\nThe work immediately done is the lifting up the weight \\( L \\). In order to accomplish this, we must employ a pressure \\( P \\), which is greater than \\( L \\). Let it be \\( L + y \\); also let \\( s \\) be the length of the stroke.\n\nIf the mass \\( L \\) were urged along the space \\( s \\) by the force \\( L + y \\), it would acquire a certain velocity, which we may express by \\( \\sqrt{s} \\); but it is impelled only by the force \\( y \\), the rest of \\( P \\) being employed in balancing \\( L \\). The velocities which different forces generate by impelling a body along the same space are as the square roots of the forces. Therefore \\( \\sqrt{L + y} : \\sqrt{y} = \\sqrt{s} : \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{L + y}} \\).","sp":250,"ep":273},{"h":"STEATOMA","t":"a kind of encysted tumor, consisting of a matter like flax or lard, soft, without pain, and without discolouring the skin.","sp":306,"ep":307},{"h":"STEEL","t":"iron united with carbon, from which it possesses properties distinct from those of iron, and which render it of superior value.

Our author left the university, which he did without taking any degree, in the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to enter into the army. This step was highly displeasing to his friends; but the ardour of his passion for a military life rendered him deaf to any other proposal. Not being able to procure a better station, he entered as a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in the horse guards, notwithstanding he thereby lost the succession to his Irish estate. However, as he had a flow of good nature, a generous openness and frankness of spirit, and a sparkling vivacity of wit, these qualities rendered him the delight of the soldiery, and procured him an ensign's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the guards. In the mean time, as he had made choice of a profession which set him free from all the ordinary restraints in youth, he spared not to indulge his inclinations in the wildest excesses. Yet his gallantries and revels did not pass without some cool hours of reflection; it was in these that he drew up his little treatise intitled...\nThe Christian Hero, with a design, if we may believe himself, to be a check upon his passions. For this purpose it had lain some time by him, when he printed it in 1701, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> to Lord Cutts, who had not only appointed him his private secretary, but procured for him a company in Lord Lucas's regiment of Footmen.\n\nThe same year he brought out his comedy called The Funeral, or Grief \u00e0 la Mode. This play procured him the regard of King William, who resolved to give him some influential marks of his favour; and though, upon that prince's death, his hopes were disappointed, yet, in the beginning of Queen Anne's reign, he was appointed to the profitable place of gazetteer. He owed this post to the friendship of Lord Halifax and the earl of Sunderland, to whom he had been recommended by his schoolfellow Mr Addison. That gentleman also lent him an helping hand in promoting the comedy called The Tender Husband, which was acted in 1704 with great success. But his next play, The Lying Lover, had a very different fate. Upon this rebuff from the stage, he turned the same humorous current into another channel; and early in the year 1709, he began to publish the Tatler: which admirable paper was undertaken in concert with Dr Swift. His reputation was perfectly established by this work; and, during the course of it, he was made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> of the stamp-duties in 1710.

However, as our author still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to hold his place in the stamp-office under the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, he wisely declined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> subjects; and, adhering more closely to Mr Addison, he dropt the Tatler, and afterwards, by the assistance chiefly of that steady friend, he carried on the same plan, much improved, under the title of The Spectator. The success of this paper was equal to that of the former; which encouraged him, before the close of it, to proceed upon the same design in the character of the Guardian. This was opened in the beginning of the year 1713, and was laid down in October the same year. But in the course of it his thoughts took a stronger turn to politics: he engaged with great warmth against the ministry; and being determined to prosecute his views that way by procuring a seat in the house of commons, he immediately removed all obstacles thereto. For that purpose he took care to prevent a forcible dismission from his post in the stamp-office, by a timely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a> of it to the earl of Oxford; and at the same time gave up a pension, which had been till this time paid him by the queen as a servant to the late Prince George of Denmark. This done, he wrote the famous Guardian upon the demolition of Dunkirk, which was published August 7, 1713; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> being dissolved next day, the Guardian was soon followed by several other warm political tracts against the administration. Upon the meeting of the new parliament, Mr Steele having been returned a member for the borough of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKBRIDGE\">Stockbridge</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, took his seat accordingly in the house of commons; but was expelled thence in a few days after, for writing the close of the paper called the Englishman, and one of his political pieces intitled the Crisis. Presently after his expulsion, he published proposals for writing the history of the duke of Marlborough; at the same time he also wrote the Spinster; and, in opposition to the Examiner, he set up a paper called the Reader, and continued publishing several other things in the same spirit till the death of the queen. Immediately after which, as a reward for these services, he was taken into favour by her successor to the throne, King George I. He was appointed surveyor of the royal stables at Hampton-Court, governor of the royal company of comedians, put into the commission of the peace for the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a>, and in 1715 received the honour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>. In the first parliament of that king, he was chosen member for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGHBRIDGE\">Boroughbridge</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>; and, after the suppression of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> in the north, was appointed one of the commissioners of the forfeited estates in Scotland. In 1718, he buried his second wife, who had brought him a handsome fortune and a good estate in Wales; but neither this, nor the ample additions lately made to his income, were sufficient to answer his demands. The thoughtless vivacity of his spirit often reduced him to little shifts of wit for its support; and the project of the fish pool this year owed its birth chiefly to the projector's necessities. This vessel was intended to carry fish alive, and without waiting, to any part of the kingdom: but notwithstanding all his towering hopes, the scheme proved very ruinous to him; for after he had been at an immense expense in contriving and building his vessel, besides the charge of the patent, which he had procured, it turned out upon trial to be a mere project. His plan was to bring salmon alive from the coast of Ireland; but these fish, though supplied by this contrivance with a continual stream of water while at sea, yet uneasy at their confinement, shattered themselves to pieces against the sides of the pool; so that when they were brought to market they were worth very little.\n\nThe following year he opposed the remarkable peerage bill in the house of commons; and, during the course of this opposition to the court, his licence for acting plays was revoked, and his patent rendered ineffectual, at the instance of the lord chamberlain. He did his utmost to prevent so great a loss; and finding every direct avenue of approach to his royal master effectually barred against him by his powerful adversary, he had recourse to the method of applying to the public, in hopes that his complaints would reach the ear of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, though in an indirect course, by that canal. In this spirit he formed the plan of a periodical paper, to be published twice a week, under the title of the Theatre; the first number of which came out on the 2d of January 1719-20. In the mean time, the misfortune of being out of favour at court, like other misfortunes, drew after it a train of more. During the course of this paper, in which he had assumed the feigned name of Sir John Edgar, he was outrageously attacked by Mr Dennis, the noted critic, in a very abusive pamphlet, entitled The Character and Conduct of Sir John Edgar. To this insult our author made a proper reply in the Theatre.\n\nWhile he was struggling with all his might to save himself from ruin, he found time to turn his pen against the mischievous South Sea scheme, which had nearly brought...\nbrought the nation to ruin in 1720; and the next year he was restored to his office and authority in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">playhouse</a> in Drury-Lane. Of this it was not long before he made an additional advantage, by bringing his celebrated comedy called the Conscious Lovers upon that stage, where it was acted with prodigious success; so that the receipt there must have been very considerable, besides the profits accruing by the sale of the copy, and a purse of \u00a3500, given to him by the king, to whom he dedicated it. Yet notwithstanding these ample supplies, about the year following, being reduced to the utmost extremity, he sold his share in the play-house; and soon after commenced a law-suit with the managers, which in 1726 was decided against him. Having now again, for the last time, brought his fortune, by the most heedless profusion, into a desperate condition, he was rendered altogether incapable of retrieving the loss, by being seized with a paralytic disorder, which greatly impaired his understanding. In these unhappy circumstances, he retired to his seat at Languanor near Caerphilly in Wales, where he died on the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1729, and was privately interred, according to his own desire, in the church of Caerphilly. Among his papers were found the manuscripts of two plays, one called The Gentlemen, founded upon the Eunuch of Terence, and the other intitled The School of Action, both nearly finished.\n\nSir Richard was a man of undiminished and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, a friend to the friendless, and, as far as his circumstances would permit, the father of every orphan. His works are chaste and manly. He was a stranger to the most distasteful appearance of envy or malevolence; never jealous of any man's growing reputation; and so far from arrogating any praise to himself from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with Mr Addison, that he was the first who desired him to distinguish his papers. His great fault was want of economy; and it has been said of him, he was certainly the most agreeable and the most innocent rake that ever trod the rounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a>.","sp":312,"ep":314},{"h":"STEEL-YARD","t":"is one of the most ancient presents which science has made to society; and though long in defectude in this country, is in most nations of the world the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for ascertaining the weight of bodies.

It was the patera of the Greeks and Romans, and seems to have been more confided in by them than the balance; for which reason it was used by the goldsmiths, while the balance was the instrument of the people.\u2014Non aurificis patera sed populari trutina examinare. Cic. de Orat. 238.\n\nThe steelyard is a lever of unequal arms, and, in its most perfect form, is constructed much like a common balance. It hangs in three (fig. 1,) resting on the nail C, and the scale L for holding the goods hangs by a nail D on the short arm BC. The counter weight P hangs by a ring of tempered steel, made sharp in the inside, that it may bear by an edge on the long arm CA of the steelyard. The under edge of the centre nail C, and the upper edge of the nail D, are in the straight line formed by the upper edge of the long arm. Thus the three points of suspension are in one straight line.

By this she will run more uniformly in a straight path, as declining less to the right and left; whereas, if a greater effort of the helm is employed, it will produce a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a> from the course, and not only increase the difficulty of steering, but also make a crooked and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> track through the water. See Helm.\u2014The helmsman should diligently watch the movements of the head by the land, clouds, moon, or stars; because, although Steering, the course is in general regulated by the compass, yet the vibrations of the needle are not so quickly perceived as the fallies of the ship's head to the right or left, which, if not immediately restrained, will acquire additional velocity in every instant of their motion, and demand a more powerful impulse of the helm to reduce them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of which will operate to turn her head as far on the contrary side of her course.\n\n\u2014The phrases used in steering a ship vary according to the relation of the wind to her course. Thus, if the wind is fair or large, the phrases used by the pilot or officer who superintends the steerage are, port, starboard, and steady. The first is intended to direct the ship's course farther to the right; the second is to guide her farther to the left; and the last is designed to keep her exactly in the line wherein she advances, according to the course prescribed. The excesses of the first and second movements is called hard-a-port, and hard-a-starboard; the former of which gives her the greatest possible inclination to the right, and the latter an equal tendency to the left.\u2014If, on the contrary, the wind is foul or scant, the phrases are luff, thus, and no nearer; the first of which is the order to keep her close to the wind; the second, to retain her in her present situation; and the third to keep her fails full.\n\nIn a ship of war, the exercise of steering the ship is usually divided amongst a number of the most expert sailors, who attend the helm in their turns; and are accordingly called timoneers, from the French term timonier, which signifies \"helmsman.\" The steerage is constantly superintended by the quarter-masters, who also attend the helm by rotation. In merchant ships every seaman takes his turn in this service, being directed therein by the mate of the watch, or some other officer.\u2014As the safety of a ship, and all contained therein, depends in a great measure on the steerage or effects of the helm, the apparatus by which it is managed should often be diligently examined by the proper officers. Indeed, a negligence in this important duty appears almost unpardonable, when the fatal effects which may result from it are duly considered.","sp":314,"ep":314},{"h":"STEEVENS","t":"GEORGE, the most successful of all the editors and commentators of Shakespeare, was born in the year 1735. We know nothing respecting his parents, but they appear to have been in affluent circumstances. Our author received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at Kingston-upon-Thames, and had Gibbon the historian for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> at that school. From hence he went to Eton, and in a few years was admitted a fellow commoner of King's college, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; but no mention is made of his peculiar course of studies. It appears, however, that he had little relish for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, which lead at Cambridge to academical honours. On the first establishment of the Essex militia, he accepted of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>; but he spent the concluding years of his life in almost total seclusion from the world, seldom mingling with society, but in the shops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BOOKSELLERS\">booksellers</a>, in the Shakespeare gallery, or in the morning conversations of Sir Joseph Banks.\n\nAlthough not an original writer, we cannot in justice refuse him a place among the first literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the age, when we consider the works he illustrated, and the learning, sagacity, taste, and general knowledge which he brought to the task. With a versatility of talents,\nlents, he was eminent both by his pen and his pencil, but his chief excellence lay in his critical knowledge of an author's text; and the best specimen of his great abilities is his edition of Shakespeare, in which he has left every competitor far behind him. He had studied the age of Shakespeare, and employed his persevering industry in becoming acquainted with the writings, manners, and laws of that period, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> peculiarities, whether of language or customs, which prevailed in different parts of the kingdom, but more particularly in those where Shakespeare passed the early years of his life. He was continually increasing this store of knowledge, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of the obsolete publications of a former age, which he spared no expense to obtain. His critical sagacity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> were constantly employed in calling forth the hidden meanings of the dramatic bard, and of course enlarging the display of his beauties. This advantage is apparent from his last edition of Shakespeare, which contains so large a portion of new, interesting, and accumulated instruction. In preparing it for the press, he gave an instance of activity and perseverance without example. To this work he exclusively devoted a period of 18 months, during which he left his house every morning at one o'clock, going to his friend Mr Isaac Read's chambers in Barnard's-inn, without any consideration of the weather or the season, and there he found a sheet of the Shakespeare letter-press ready for correction. Thus, while the printers slept the editor was awake, by which means he completed, in less than 20 months, his splendid edition of Shakespeare in 15 vols. octavo; a labour almost incredible, and by which the energy and persevering powers of his mind were fully proved.\n\nHe probably rested satisfied with being a commentator from the particular habits of his life, and his devotion to the name of Shakespeare. But at the same time he was a classical scholar of the first order, and well acquainted with the belles lettres of Europe. He studied ancient and modern history; and particularly that of his own country. His genius was strong and original; his wit abundant; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of every colour; and his sentiments enlivened with the most brilliant expressions. His eloquence was logical and animated; his descriptions were true to nature, his figures so curiously selected, and so happily grouped, that he might be regarded as a speaking Hogarth. He scattered his wit and his humour too freely around him, and they were not lost for want of gathering.\n\nMr Steevens had a very handsome fortune, which he managed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. His generosity was equal to his fortune; and though not profuse of his money to flabby beggars, few persons distributed with more liberality to truly deserving objects. He possessed all the graces of outward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>, at a period when civility and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> were characteristics of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>.\n\nHe bequeathed his valuable Shakespeare, illustrated with about 1500 prints, to Lord Spencer; his Hogarth perfect, with the exception of one or two pieces, to Mr Windham; and his corrected copy of Shakespeare, with 200 guineas, to his friend Mr Read.

I.\n\nThe art of stenography, or short writing, was known and practised by most of the ancient civilized nations. The Egyptians, who were distinguished for learning at an early period, at first expressed their words by a delineation of figures called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a>. A more concise mode of writing seems to have been afterwards introduced, in which only a part of the symbol or picture was drawn. This answered the purpose of shorthand in some degree. After them the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Romans*, adopted different methods of abbreviating their words and sentences, suited to their respective languages. The initials, the finals, or radicals, often served for whole words; and various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of these sometimes formed a sentence. Arbitrary marks were likewise employed to determine the meaning, and to assist legibility; and it seems probable that every writer, and every author of antiquity, had some peculiar method of abbreviation, calculated to facilitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of his own sentiments, and intelligible only to himself.\n\nIt is also probable, that some might by these means take down the heads of a discourse or oration; but few, very few, it is presumed, could have followed a speaker through all the meanders of rhetoric, and noted with precision every syllable, as it dropt from his mouth, in a manner legible even to themselves.\n\nTo arrive at such consummate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in the art was reserved for more modern times, and is still an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> by no means general.\n\nIn every language of Europe, till about the close of the 16th century, the Roman plan of abbreviating (viz. substituting the initials or radicals, with the help of arbitraries, for words) appears to have been employed. Till then no regular alphabet had been invented expressly for stenography, when an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the name of Willis invented and published one (B). His plan was soon altered and improved, or at least pretended to be so. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> succeeded another; and at intervals, for a series of years past, some men of ingenuity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> have composed and published systems of stenography, and doubtless have themselves reaped all the advantages that attend it. But among the various methods that have been proposed, and the different plans that have been adopted by individuals, none has yet appeared fortunate enough to gain general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>; or proved sufficiently simple, clear, and concise, to be universally studied and practised.\n\nSome systems are replete with unmeaning symbols, perplexing arbitraries, and ill-judged contractions; which render them so difficult to be attained by a common capacity, or ordinary application, that it is not to be wondered at if they have sunk into neglect, and are now no longer known (c). Other systems, by being too prolix, by containing a multiplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and those characters not simple or easily remembered, become ineffectual to the purpose of expedition, and are only superior in obscurity to a common hand. Some, again, not only reject all arbitraries and contractions, but even prepositions and terminations; which last, if not too lavishly employed and badly devised, highly contribute to promote both expedition and legibility; and though they reduce their characters to fewer than can possibly express the various modifications of sound, yet they make nearly one half of them complex. In the disposition of the vowels, there is the greatest perplexity in most systems. A dot is sometimes substituted for all the vowels indiscriminately, and the judgement is left to determine which letter out of any dot is intended to express; or a minute space is allotted them; so that unless they be arranged with mathematical precision they cannot be distinguished from one another; but such a minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is inconsistent with the nature of short-hand, which should teach us to write down in a short time, as well as in small bounds, what we wish to preserve of what we hear. Nor is the plan of lifting the pen and putting the next consonant in the vowel's place, in the middle of words, less liable to objections; or that of representing all the vowels by distinct characters, being obviously ill calculated for facility and dispatch.\n\n(A) The value of stenography is not unknown to the learned; and the care and success with which it has been lately cultivated in these kingdoms will, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, soon render it an object of general attention. No one, however, appears to us to have simplified and improved the art so much as Dr Mavor, author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> Stenography, who has liberally permitted us to present our readers with a complete view of his scheme. To those who wish to become proficient in Short-writing, we earnestly recommend his entire publication (printed for Cadell and Davis, Strand, London), which in many schools of the first reputation now forms a deserved clasbook.\n\n(B) Mr Locke says, a regular method of short-writing seems to be known and practised only in Britain. This is not now the case; and indeed there is no reason to doubt whether characters may not be invented to express the various sounds, or letters, employed in any language, either ancient or modern.\n\n(C) A list of writers on stenography.

D. and Willis, &c.\ndispatch, and consequently inadmissible into any useful system.\n\nIt is to be confessed, that the person who first proposed the omission of vowels in the middle of words (D), which it is obvious are not wanted, and invented letters, which could be connected as in a running hand without lifting the pen in the middle of the word, made a real improvement on the works of his predecessors. But, in fine, most systems, either in their plan or execution, labour under some capital defect, attended with circumstances highly discouraging to the learner, and which in a great measure defeat the end of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, by being too complicated to be learned with ease and remembered with accuracy, or to be practised with the expedition which is requisite; and so difficult to be deciphered, that a man can scarcely read what he has just written.\n\nTo obviate these defects; to provide against prolixity and conciseness, which might occasion obscurity; to exhibit a system founded on the simplest principles, which might be easily learned and read, and yet be capable of the utmost expedition\u2014were the motives that gave rise to the present attempt.\n\nThis method will be found different from any yet published, and superior to all in the disposition of the vowels and the facility of arranging them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> in placing which seems to detract from the merit of the best performances on the subject; and it may be affirmed, without ostentation, that characters simpler in their form, and more perfect in their union, have not been applied to the art of stenography.\n\nAs well as it could be determined, the simplest characters are appropriated to the letters most usually employed: indeed, as far as possible, those which are complex have been rejected; but as it was an object always kept in view that the writing should be on a line, a few are admitted into the alphabet for that reason.\n\nThe characters for the double and triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-CONSONANTS\">consonants</a> are the easiest that could be invented, consistent with perspicuity (E); for care has been taken to provide against all obscurity which might arise by adopting letters too similar in their formation; and with respect to the prepositions and terminations, those which occur most frequently are expressed by the simplest characters, which will be found perfectly easy in their application.\n\nThe arbitrariness are few in number (F), and the arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a>, as they are entirely from the letters of the alphabet, and chosen from some thousands of words in common use, will well repay the learner for an hour's trouble in committing them to memory.\n\nThe last chapter lays down a scheme of abbreviation, comprised in a few rules, perfectly easy to be understood and practised by proficient in this art, which we hope will answer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of the author, and will be found free from the perplexity complained of in many systems where abbreviation is admitted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> rules are new, are so easy, so extensive in their use, and so consistent with expedition and legibility, if applied with judgment, that they alone might suffice. The learner is however advised by no means to adopt any of them, till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has convinced him that they may be used without error or injury to legibility. All abbreviating rules are suited to those only who have made some progress in the stenographic art; for although they certainly promote expedition in a wonderful manner, and afford the greatest ease to a proficient, yet a learner, as expedition is not his first, though his ultimate view, should admit of nothing that in the least renders the reading difficult.\n\nCHAP. II.\n\nThe English alphabet consists of twenty-five letters; the first of which are vowels, a, e, i, o, u, and y; and the other twenty consonants, b, c, d, f, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, and z.\n\nThis alphabet, as is observed by the best grammarians that have written on the language, is both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> in expressing the various modifications of sound.\n\nCustom or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> has assigned some letters a place, when others would with much more propriety express the same sound: and to this may be added, that several letters, sometimes in one word, seem to be admitted for no other reason than to perplex a young beginner or a foreigner, as an obstruction to true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a>, and to add to the apparent length of the word, when they are entirely quiescent and useless. That this is the genius of the orthography of our language must be perceived by the most superficial observer; but no modern tongue is absolutely free from the same exceptions. In particular, the French has a great number of dormant letters, which, it is obvious, render the pronunciation more difficult and perplexing to learners (G).\n\nBut as it is neither our business nor our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to propose a mode of spelling different from that in common use, when applied to printing or long-hand writing (since several innovators in orthography have fallen into contempt, and their plans have been only preserved as beacons to warn others of the folly of endeavouring to subvert established principles); we shall only observe,\u2020 Preface that in stenography, where the most expeditious and concise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>.\nconcise method is the best, if consistent with perspicuity, the following simple rules are studiously to be regarded and practised.\n\nRule I. All quiescent consonants in words are to be dropped; and the orthography to be directed only by the pronunciation: which being known to all, will render this art attainable by those who cannot spell with precision in long hand.\n\nRule II. When the absence of consonants, not entirely dormant, can be easily known, they may often be omitted without the least obscurity.\n\nRule III. Two or sometimes more consonants may, to promote greater expedition, be exchanged for a single one of nearly similar sound; and no ambiguity as to the meaning ensue (H).\n\nRule IV. When two consonants of the same kind or same sound come together, without any vowel between them, only one is to be expressed; but if a vowel or vowels intervene, both are to be written: only observe, if they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, or oblique lines, they must only be drawn a size longer than usual; and characters with loops must have the size of their heads doubled.\n\nMight is to be written mit, fight fit, machine maishin, enough enuf, laugh laf, prophet profet, physics fisiks, through thro', foreign foron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> soveren, palm jam, receipt recpt, write rite, wright rit, island island, knavery nevvy, temptation tentation, knife nife, stick flk, thigh thi, honour honur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> indiment, acquaint aquaint, chaos knos, &c.\n\nStrength strenth, length lenth, friendship frenship, connect conekt, commandment comament, conjunct conjunt, humble humle, lumber lumer, slumber slumer, number numer, exemplary examlary, &c.\n\nRocks rox, acts akt or akt, facts faks or fax, districts distrixs, or distrix, affects afeks or afex, afflicts affiks or affix, conquer konkr, &c.\n\nLetter leter, little little, command comand, error eror, terror teror, &c. But in remember, moment, miter, and such like words, where two consonants of the same name have an intervening vowel, both of them must be written.\n\nThese four rules, with their examples, being carefully considered by the learner, will leave him in no doubt concerning the disposition and management of the consonants in this scheme of short-writing; we shall therefore proceed to lay down rules for the application of the vowels with ease and expedition.\n\nRule I. Vowels, being only simple articulate sounds, though they are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONNECTIVES\">connectives</a> of consonants, and employed in every word and every syllable, are not necessary to be inserted in the middle of words; because the consonants, if fully pronounced, with the assistance of connection, will always discover the meaning of a word, and make the writing perfectly legible.\n\nRule II. If a vowel is not strongly accented in the incipient syllable of a word, or if it is mute in the final, it is likewise to be omitted; because the sound of the incipient vowel is often implied in that of the first consonant, which will consequently supply its place.\n\nRule III. But if the vowel constitutes the first or last syllable of a word, or is strongly accented at its beginning or end, that vowel is continually to be written.\n\nRule IV. If a word begins or ends with two or more vowels though separated, or when there is a coalition of vowels, as in diphthongs and triphthongs; only one of them is to be expressed, which must be that which agrees best with the pronunciation.\n\nRule V. In monosyllables, if they begin or end with a vowel, it is always to be inferred, unless the vowel be mute at the end of a word.\n\nSuch are the general principles of this art; in vindication and support of which it will be needless to offer any arguments, when it is considered that brevity and expedition are the chief objects, if consistent with legibility; and the subsequent specimens in the orthography recommended will, we hope, be sufficient to show that there is no real deficiency in the last mentioned particular.\n\nHe who md us mst be etnrl, grt, nd mntnt.

III.\n\nAs the whole of this art depends upon a regular method and a simple alphabet, we have not only endeavoured to establish the former on satisfactory principles, but have been careful to appropriate, according to the comparative frequency of their occurrence, such charac-\n\n(H) By this rule likewise q and v in the middle of words, but never in the beginning, may be exchanged for k and f, when they admit of an easier connecting with the following character, or will make the writing appear neater.\nters for the letters as, after repeated trials and alterations, were conceived to be the best adapted for dispatch.\n\nThe stenographic alphabet consists of 18 distinct characters (viz. two for the vowels and the rest for the consonants), taken from lines and semicircular curves; the formation and application of which we shall now explain, beginning with the vowels.\n\nFor the three first vowels, a, e, and i, a comma is appropriated in different positions; and for the other three, o, u, and y, a point. The comma and point, when applied to a, and o, is to be placed, as in the Plate DVII. at the top of the next character; when for e and u, opposite to the middle; and when for i and y, at the bottom.\n\nThis arrangement of the vowels is the most simple and distinct that can easily be imagined. Places at the top, the middle, and the bottom of characters, which make three different positions, are as easily distinguished from one another as any three separate characters could be; and a comma is made with the same facility as a point.\n\nSimple lines may be drawn four different ways; perpendicular, horizontal, and with an angle of about 45 degrees to the right and left. An ascending oblique line to the right, which will be perfectly distinct from the rest when joined to any other character, may likewise be admitted. These characters being the simplest in nature, are assigned to those five consonants which most frequently occur, viz. l, r, t, c hard or k, and c soft or s.\n\nEvery circle may be divided with a perpendicular and horizontal line, so as to form likewise four distinct characters. These being the next to lines in the simplicity of their formation, we have appropriated them for b, d, n, and m.\n\nThe characters expressing nine of the consonants are all perfectly distinct from one another; eight only remain which are needful, viz. f, g or j, h, p, q, v, w, and x; to find characters for which we must have recourse to mixed curves and lines. The characters which we have adopted are the simplest in nature after those already applied, admit of the easiest joining, and tend to preserve lineality and beauty in the writing.\n\nIt must be observed that we have no character for c when it has a hard sound, as in castle; or soft, as in city; for it naturally takes the sound of k or s, which in all cases will be sufficient to supply its place.\n\nR likewise is represented by the same character as l; only with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, r is written with an ascending stroke (i), and l with a descending; which is always to be known from the manner of its union with the following character; but in a few monosyllables where r is the only consonant in the word, and consequently stands alone, it is to be made as is shown in the alphabet for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>'s sake.\n\nZ, as it is a letter seldom employed in the English language, and only a coarser and harsher expression of s, must be supplied by s whenever it occurs; as for Zedekiah write Sedekiah, &c.\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\nThe prepositions and terminations in this scheme are so simple, that the greatest benefit may be reaped from them, and very little trouble required to attain them; and terms as the incipient letter or the incipient consonant of all nations, the prepositions and of several of the terminations is used to express the whole. But although in Plate DVII. sufficient specimens are given of the manner of their application, that the learner of less ingenuity or more slow perception may have every assistance, we have subjoined the following directions.\n\nRule I. The preposition is always to be written without joining, yet so near as plainly to show what word it belongs to; and the best way is to observe the same order as if the whole was to be connected.\n\nRule II. A preposition, though the same letters that constitute it may be met with in the middle or end of a word, is never to be used, because it would expose to obscurity.\n\nRule III. Observe that the preposition omni is expressed by the vowel e in its proper position; and for anti, anta, ante, by the vowel a, which the radical part of the word will easily distinguish from being only simple vowels.\n\nThe first rule for the prepositions is (allowing such exceptions as may be seen in the Plate) to be observed for the terminations; and also the second, mutatis mutandis; except that whenever sis, fis, fys, cious, tius, and ces occur, they are to be expressed as directed in the fourth rule for the consonants, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of words (k).\n\nRule IV. The terminative character for tion, sion, cion, cian, tian, is to be expressed by a small circle joined to the nearest letter, and turned to the right; and the plurals tions, sions, cions, cians, tians, tience, by a dot on the same side.\n\nRule V. The terminative character for ing, is to be expressed likewise by a small circle, but drawn to the left hand; and its plural ings by a dot (i).\n\nRule VI. The plural sign s is to be added to the terminative characters when necessary.\n\nRule VII. The separated terminations are never to be used but in polysyllables or words of more syllables than one.\n\nThese rules duly observed will point out a method as concise and elegant as can be desired, for expressing the most\n\n(1) The character for h, when lineality requires it, may be made from the bottom and inverted (see Plate DVII.). And often h may be omitted entirely, or a vowel may be substituted in its stead, without any injury to legibility, it being rather a breathing than letter.\n\n(k) But in a few words where three horizontal characters meet, it will be better to express the fis, &c. by the semieliptical character in Plate DVII., opposite tious.\n\n(i) In horizontal characters, by the left hand is meant the top, and by the right the space below the letter (i.e. ing joined, Plate DVII.). In all other characters the right and left positions will naturally be known.\nmost frequent and longest prepositions and terminations in the English language. If it should be thought necessary to increase their number by the addition of others, it will be an easy matter for any one of the least discernment to do so, by proceeding on the principles before laid down.\n\nCHAP. V.\n\nThough a more concise method of writing, or more numerous abbreviations, may not be indispensably necessary, if the foregoing directions be practised for a considerable time, yet contractions will be found extremely useful and convenient to those who have attained a proper knowledge of the subject, and lead to a greater degree of expedition, at the same time that they diminish the labour of writing. It has been observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a>, that abbreviations are only to be employed by proficient in this art; because expedition is not the first, though the ultimate, object in view; and that an easy legibility is of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to the learner; which, however, cannot be preserved, if he adopts too soon those very rules which in time will afford him the greatest ease when applied with judgment.\n\nThe following short and practical rules will be found, we hope, fully adequate to every purpose for which they were intended, and are far superior in the facility of their application to any which we have seen.\n\nRULE I. The usual abbreviations in long hand are always to be followed; as Mr for Master, M.D. for Doctor of Physic, and Abp. for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a>, &c.\n\nRULE II. Substantives, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ADJECTIVES\">adjectives</a>, verbs, and participles, when the sense will direct to the meaning, are to be expressed by their initial consonant with the distinguishing marks exhibited in Plate DVII. viz. a substantive must have the dot exactly over its initial consonant; an adjective must have a dot under it; a verb is to be expressed by a comma over its initial consonant; and a participle by a comma under (M). These being the four principal parts of speech will be sufficient; and an adept will never be at a loss to know when he can with safety apply this rule to them.\n\nRULE III. To render the writing more legible, the last letter of the word may be joined to the first, and the proper mark applied.\n\nRULE IV. The constituent or radical part of words, especially if they are long, will often serve for the whole, or sometimes the first syllable: as, we ought to moderate our ex. by our circum.; a man's man. commonly shape his for.\n\nRULE V. All long words without exception may have their prepositions or terminations expressed by the incipient consonant of such preposition or termination.\n\nRULE VI. When there is a great dependence between the parts of a sentence, the initial letter will often suffice; as L. is the capital of Great B.; the eldest S. of the king of Great B. is styled prince of W. Every one, it is presumed, will allow this to be perfectly legible in long-hand, then why may it not in stenography?\n\nRULE VII. The terminations nos and less may be omitted; as faithfulness is only to be written faithful; forwardness, forward; headless, heed; stubborness, stubborn, &c.\n\nRULE VIII. The second and third persons of verbs, ending in eth and eth, may be expressed by s; as, he loves, thou teachest; instead of he loveth, thou teachest; or even without s; as, he love, &c.\n\nRULE IX. Words may often be entirely omitted, and yet no ambiguity ensue; as, In beginning God created heaven and earth, for In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\n\nRULE X. When there is an immediate repetition of a sentence or word, a line is to be drawn under the sentence or word to be repeated; as, Amen, Amen, Amen, is to be written Amen; but if any words intervene before a word or sentence is to be repeated, the line must be drawn as before, and a or mark of omission placed where the repetition should begin; as, Is it just the innocents should be condemned a reviled?\n\nThe CONTENTS of the STENOGRAPHIC PLATES.\n\nFabricius's Reply to Pyrrhus.\n\nAs to my poverty, you have indeed, Sir, been rightly informed. My whole estate consists in a house of but mean appearance, and a little spot of ground, from which by my own labour I draw my support. But if by any means you have been persuaded to think, that this poverty makes me less considered in my country, or in any degree unhappy, you are extremely deceived. I have no reason to complain of fortune, she supplies me with all that nature requires; and if I am without luxuries, I am also free from the desire of them. With these I confess I should be more able to succour the necessitous, the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied; but as small as my possessions are, I can still contribute something to the support of the state and the affluence of my friends. With regard to honours, my country places me, poor as I am, upon a level with the richest: for Rome knows no qualifications for great employments but virtue and ability. She appoints me to officiate in the most august ceremonies of religion; she entrusts me with the command of her armies; she confides to my care the most important negotiations. My poverty does not lessen the weight and influence of my counsels in the senate; the Roman people honour me for that very poverty which you consider as a disgrace; they know the many opportunities I have had in war to enrich myself without incurring censure; they are convinced of my disinterested zeal for their prosperity; and if I have any thing to complain of in the return they make, it is only the excess of their applause. What value then can I set upon your gold and silver! What king can add anything to my fortune! Always attentive to discharge the duties <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a>\n\n(M) The dot or comma being placed thus will never occasion them to be mistaken for vowels, because they should always be on one side or other; whereas the mark for parts of speech may constantly be placed exactly over or under.\nincumbent on me, I have a mind free from self-reproach, and I have an honest fame. Dodley's Preceptor.\n\nLetter to a Friend against waste of Time.\n\nConverse often with yourself, and neither lavish your time, nor suffer others to rob you of it. Many of our hours are stolen from us, and others pass insensibly away; but of both these losses the most shameful is that which happens through our own neglect. If we take the trouble to observe, we shall find that one considerable part of our life is spent in doing evil, and the other in doing nothing, or in doing what we should not do. We don't seem to know the value of time, nor how precious a day is; nor do we consider that every moment brings us nearer our end. Reflect upon this, I entreat you, and keep a strict account of time. Procrastination is the most dangerous thing in life. Nothing is properly ours but the instant we breathe in, and all the rest is nothing; it is the only good we possess; but then it is fleeting, and the first comer robs us of it. Men are so weak, that they think they oblige by giving of trifles, and yet reckon that time as nothing for which the most grateful person in the world can never make amends. Let us therefore consider time as the most valuable of all things; and every moment spent, without some improvement in virtue or some advancement in goodness, as the greatest sublunary loss.\n\nSt Paul's Speech before Agrippa and Festus.\n\nI think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I shall answer for myself this day before thee, touching all things whereof I am accused of the Jews: especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews, wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. My manner of life from my youth, which was at first among mine own nation at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, know all the Jews, which knew me from the beginning (if they would testify), that, after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come; for which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead, when God himself has given assurance of it unto all men, in that he hath raised Christ from the dead? As for my own part, most noble Festus, I own I once verily thought that even I myself ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem. I punished the saints oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. In pursuit of which, as I went to Damascus, with authority and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> from the chief priests: At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining about me, and them which journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision: but thowed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God. For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. This is the real truth: Believe me, I am no pestilent fellow, nor mover of sedition; but always endeavour all that lies in me to preserve a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> void of offence towards God and towards man: nor can the Jews prove the things whereof they now accuse me. Neither am I, Festus, besides myself; but I speak thus freely before the king, because he knows these things to be fact; yea, I am fully persuaded the king knows them all to be fact; for they were not done in a corner. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. And would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were altogether such as I am except these bonds. Holmes's Rhetoric.\n\nPope to Atterbury.\n\nOnce more I write to you as I promised, and this once I fear will be the last; the curtain will soon be drawn between my friend and me, and nothing left but to wish you a long good night; may you enjoy a state of repose in this life not unlike that sleep of the soul which some have believed is to succeed it, where we lie utterly forgetful of that world from which we are gone, and ripening for that to which we are to go. If you retain any memory of the past, let it only image to you what has pleased you best; sometimes present a dream of an absent friend, or bring you back an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>. But, upon the whole, I hope you will think less of the time past than the future; as the former has been less kind to you than the latter infallibly will be. Do not envy the world your studies: They will tend to the benefit of men, against whom you can have no complaint; I mean, of all posterity: and, perhaps, at your time of life, nothing else is worth your care. What is every year of a wise man's life but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a> or critic on the past? Those whose date is the shortest, live long enough to laugh at one half of it: The boy despises the infant, the man the body, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> both, and the Christian all. You may now begin to think your manhood was too much a puerility; and you will never suffer your age to be but a second infancy. The toys and baubles of your childhood are hardly now more below you than those toys of our riper and our declining years; the drums and rattles of ambition, and the dirt and bubbles of avarice. At this time, when you are cut off from a little society, and made a citizen of the world at large, you should bend your talents not to serve a party, or a few, but all mankind. Your genius should mount above that mist, in which its participation and neighbourhood with earth hath long involved it: To shine abroad, and to heaven, ought\nought to be the business and the glory of your present situation. Remember it was at such a time that the greatest lights of antiquity dazzled and blazed the most in their retreat, in their exile, or in their death. But why do I talk of dazzling or blazing? it was then that they did good, that they gave light, and that they became guides to mankind.

His father Roger Sterne was the grandson of Sterne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of York, who has been supposed, we know not upon what grounds, to have been the author of the excellent book entitled \"The Whole Duty of Man.\" Laurence inherited nothing of his ancestor's manner of writing, but rather resembled Rabelais, whose wit he carried with him even into the pulpit.\n\nIn 1722 he was sent to school at Halifax in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till 1732, when he was removed to Jesus College in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. How long he resided in college, or what progress he made in literature or science, is not known: his works display rather native genius than profound erudition. Upon quitting the university he went to York, and being in orders was presented to the living of Sutton by the interest of his uncle Dr Sterne, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREBENDARY\">prebendary</a> of that church. In 1741 he married, and was soon afterwards made a prebendary of York, by the interest also of his uncle, who was then upon very good terms with him; but \"quickly quarrelled with him (he says), and became his bitterest enemy, because he would not be a party man, and write paragraphs in the newspapers.\" By his wife's means he got the living of Stillington, but remained near 20 years at Sutton, doing duty at both places. He was then in very good health, which, however, soon after forsook him; and books, painting, fiddling, and shooting, were, as he tells us, his amusements.\n\nIn 1760, he went to London to publish his two first volumes of \"Tristram Shandy;\" and was that year presented to the curacy of Coxwold. In 1762 he went to France, and two years after to Italy, for the recovery of his health; but his health never was recovered. He languished under a consumption of the lungs, without the slightest depreration of spirits, till 1768, when death put a period to his terrestrial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\nThe works of Sterne are very generally read. They consist of, 1. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy; 2. Sermons; 3. A Sentimental Journey; 4. Letters, published since his death. In every serious page, and in many of much levity, the author writes in praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, and declares that no one who knew him could suppose him one of those wretches who heap misfortune upon misfortune: But we have heard anecdotes of him extremely well authenticated, which proved that it was easier for him to praise this virtue than to practise it. His wit is universally allowed; but many readers have persuaded themselves that they found wit in his blank pages, while it is probable that he intended nothing but to amuse himself with the idea of the sage conjectures to which these pages would give occasion.\n\nEven his originality is not such as is generally supposed by those fond admirers of the Shandean manner, who have presumed to compare him with Swift, Arbuthnot, and Butler. He has borrowed both matter and manner from various authors, and in particular from an old work, \"The Anatomy of Melancholy by Burton,\" as every reader may be convinced by the learned, elegant, and candid comments on his works published by Dr Ferrier, in the fourth volume of the Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>.","sp":332,"ep":332},{"h":"STERNE-POST","t":"a long straight piece of timber erected on the extremity of the keel, to sustain the rudder and terminate the ship behind.\n\nThis piece ought to be well secured and supported; because the ends of all the lower planks of the ship's bottom are fixed in a channel, cut on its surface; and the whole weight of the rudder is sustained by it.\n\nSTERNE-Sheets, that part of a boat which is contained between the stern and the aftmost or hindmost seat of the rowers.

The greatest officer under the crown is the lord high-steward of England, an office that was anciently the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>, till forfeited by Simon de Montfort to King Henry III. But the power of this officer is so very great, that it has not been judged safe to trust it any longer in the hands of a subject, excepting only pro hac vice, occasionally: as to officiate at a coronation, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARRAIGNMENT\">arraignment</a> of a nobleman for high-treason, or the like. During his office, the steward bears a white staff in his hand; and the trial, &c. ended, he breaks the staff, and with it his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> expires. There is likewise a lord-steward of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>, who is the chief officer of the king's court, has the care of the king's house, and authority over all the officers and servants of the household, except such as belong to the chapel, chamber, and stable.\n\nSteward, an officer in a ship of war, appointed by the purser to distribute the different species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> to the officers and crew; for which purpose he is furnished with a mate and proper assistants.\n\nCourt of the Lord High Steward of Great Britain, is a court instituted for the trial of peers indicted for treason or felony, or for misprision of either. The office of this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> is very ancient, and was formerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, or at least held for life, or dum bene se gerit: but now it is usually, and hath been for many centuries past, granted pro hac vice only; and it hath been the constant practice (and therefore seems now to have become necessary) to grant it to a lord of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, else he is incapable to dry such delinquent peer. When such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> is therefore found by a grand jury of freeholders in the King's bench, or at the assizes before the justices of eyre and terminer, it is to be removed by a writ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CERTIORARI\">certiorari</a> into the court of the lord high-steward, which has the only power to determine it. A peer may plead a pardon before the court of King's bench, and the judges have power to allow it, in order to prevent the trouble of appointing an high-steward merely for the purpose of receiving such plea: but he may not plead in that inferior court any other plea, as guilty or not guilty of the indictment, but only in this court; because, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of such plea, it is possible that judgment of death might be awarded against him. The king, therefore, in case a peer be indicted of treason, felony, or misprision, creates a lord high-steward pro hac vice by commission under the great seal; which recites the indictment so found, and gives his Grace power to receive and try it secundum legem et consuetudinem Anglie. Then when the indictment is regularly removed by writ of certiorari, commanding the inferior court to certify it up to him, the lord high-steward directs a precept to a sergeant at arms, to summon the lords to attend and try the indicted peer. This precept was formerly issued to summon only 18 or 20 selected from the body of the peers; then the number came to be indefinite; and the custom was for the lord-high-steward to summon as many as he thought proper (but of late years not less than 23); and that those lords only should sit upon the trial; which threw a monstrous weight of power into the hands of the crown, and this its great officer, of selecting only such peers as the then predominant party should most approve of. And accordingly, when the earl of Clarendon fell into disgrace with Charles II., there was a design formed to prorogue the parliament, in order to try him by a select number of peers; it being doubted whether the whole house could be induced to fall in with the views of the court. But now, by statute 7 W. III. c. 3., upon all trials of peers for treason or misprision, all the peers who have a right to sit and vote in parliament shall be summoned at least 20 days before such trial, to appear and vote therein; and every lord appearing shall vote in the trial of such peer, first taking the oaths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> and supremacy, and subscribing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> against popery.\n\nDuring the session of parliament, the trial of an indicted peer is not properly in the court of the lord high-steward, but before the court last mentioned of our lord the king in parliament. It is true, a lord high-steward is always appointed in that case to regulate and add weight to the proceedings: but he is rather in the nature of a speaker pro tempore, or chairman of the court, than the judge of it; for the collective body of the peers are therein the judges both of law and fact, and the high-steward has a vote with the rest in right of his peerage. But in the court of the lord high-steward, which is held in the recess of parliament, he is the sole judge of matters of law, as the lords triors are in matters of fact; and as they may not interfere with him in regulating the proceedings of the court, so he has no right to intermix with them in giving any vote upon the trial. Therefore, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> and attainer of a peer for murder in full parliament, it hath been holden by the judges, that in case the day appointed in the judgement for execution should lapse before execution done, a new time of execution may be appointed by either the high court of parliament during its sitting, though no high-steward be existing, or, in the recess of parliament, by the court of King's bench, the record being removed into that court.\n\nIt has been a point of some controversy, whether the bishops have now a right to sit in the court of the lord-high-steward to try indictments of treason and misprision. Some incline to imagine them included under the general words of the statute of King William \"all peers who have a right to sit and vote in parliament;\" but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> had been much clearer, if it had been \"all lords,\" and not \"all peers;\" for though bishops, on account of the baronies annexed to their bishoprics, are clearly lords of parliament, yet their blood not being ennobled, they are not universally allowed to be peers with the temporal nobility: and perhaps this word might be inserted purposely with a view to exclude them. However, there is no instance of their sitting on trials for capital offences, even upon impeachments or indictments in full parliament, much less in the court we are now treating of; for indeed they usually withdraw voluntarily, but enter a protest, declaring their right to stay. It is observable, that in the 11th chapter of the constitutions of Clarendon, made in parliament 11th Henry II., they are expressly excused, rather than excluded, from fitting and voting in trials, which concern life or limb: episcopi, sicut ceteri barones, debent interficere judicium cum baronibus, quoque perenniat ad diminutionem membrorum vel ad mortem. And Becket's quartel with the king hereupon was not on account of the exception (which was agreeable to the canon law), but of the general rule, that compelled the bishops to attend at all. And the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the house of lords\nSteward, lords in the earl of Danby's case, which hath ever since been adhered to, is consonant to these constitutions; \"that the lords spiritual have a right to stay and fit in court in capital cases, till the court proceeds to the vote of guilty or not guilty.\" It must be noted, that this revolution extends only to trials in full parliament; for to the court of the lord high-steward (in which no vote can be given, but merely that of guilty or not guilty), no bishop, as such, ever was or could be summoned: and though the statute of King William regulates the proceedings in that court, as well as in the court of parliament, yet it never intended to new-model or alter its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; and consequently does not give the lords spiritual any right, in cases of blood, which they had not before. And what makes their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> more reasonable is, that they have no right to be tried themselves in the court of the lord high-steward, and therefore surely ought not to be judges there. For the privilege of being thus tried depends upon nobility of blood rather than a seat in the house, as appears from the trials of the popish lords, of lords under age, and (since the union) of the Scotch nobility, though not in the number of the fifteen; and from the trials of females, such as the queen consort or dowager, and of all peersesses by birth; and peersesses by marriage also, unless they have, when dowagers, disparaged themselves by taking a commoner to their second husband.\n\nSTEWARD of the Chiltern Hundreds.

There he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of having for his preceptors in moral science and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> Hutcheson and Simson; by the latter of whom he was instructed in what may not improperly be called the arcana of the ancient geometry.\n\nMr Stewart's views making it necessary for him to remove to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, he was introduced by Dr Simson to Mr Maclaurin, that his mathematical studies might in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions, vol. i., by Mr Playfair.\n\nAccount of Dr Stewart in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions, vol. i., by Mr Playfair.\n\nnot suffer no interruption; and he attended the lectures of that great master with such advantage as might be expected from eminent abilities, directed by the judgement of him who made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and geometry of Newton intelligible to ordinary capacities. Mr Stewart, however, had acquired, from his intimacy with Dr Simson, such a predilection for the ancient geometry, as the modern analysis, however powerfully recommended, could not lessen; and he kept up a regular correspondence with his old master, giving him an account of his progress and his discoveries in geometry, and receiving in return many curious communications respecting the Loci Plani and the porisms of Euclid. See PORISM and SIMSON.\n\nWhile the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of porisms, to which more genius was perhaps required than to the first discovery of them, employed Dr Simson, Mr Stewart pursued the same subject in a different and new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. In doing so, he was led to the discovery of those curious and interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> which were published under the title of General Theorems in 1746. They were given without the demonstrations; but did not fail to place their discoverer at once among the geometers of the first rank. They are for the most part porisms, though Mr Stewart, careful not to anticipate the discoveries of his friend, gave them no other name than that of theorems.\n\nOur author had before this period entered into the church; and obtained, through the patronage of the duke of Argyle and the earl of Bute, the living of Rosneath, a retired country parish in the west of Scotland: but in 1747 he was elected to the mathematical chair in the university of Edinburgh, which had become vacant the year before by the death of Mr Maclaurin. The duties of this office gave a turn somewhat different to his pursuits, and led him to think of the most simple and elegant means of explaining those difficult propositions which were hitherto only accessible to men deeply versed in the modern analysis. In doing this, he was pursuing the object which of all others he most ardently wished to attain, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of geometry to such problems as the algebraic calculus alone had been thought able to resolve. His solution of Kepler's problem was the first specimen of this kind which he gave to the world; and it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to have produced one more to the credit of the method he followed, or of the abilities with which he applied it. On this problem the utmost resources of the integral calculus had been employed. But though many excellent solutions had been given, there was none of them at once direct in its method and simple in its principles. Mr Stewart was so happy as to attain both these objects; and his solution appeared in the second volume of the Essays of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh for the year 1756. In the first volume of the same collection there are some other propositions of Mr Stewart's, which are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of a curious theorem in the fourth book of Pappus. They have a relation to the subject of porisms, and one of them forms the gist of Dr Simson's Retortation. They are besides very beautiful propositions, and are demonstrated with all the elegance and simplicity of the ancient analysis.\n\nThe prosecution of the plan which he had formed of introducing into the higher parts of mixed mathematics the strict and simple form of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, produced the Treatise Physical and Mathematical, which were published in 1761, and the Essay on the Sun's Distance, which was published in 1763. In this last work it is acknowledged that he employed geometry on a task which geometry cannot perform; but while it is granted that his determination of the sun's distance is by no means free from error, it may safely be asserted that it contains a great deal which will always interest geometers, and will always be admired by them. Few errors in science are redeemed by the display of so much ingenuity, and what is more singular, of so much sound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> is everywhere elegant, and will probably be long regarded as a specimen of the most arduous inquiry which has been attempted by mere geometry.\n\nThe Sun's Distance was the last work which Dr Stewart published; and though he lived to see several animadversions on it made public, he declined entering into any controversy. His disposition was far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a>; and he knew the value of that quiet which a literary man should rarely suffer his antagonists to interrupt. He used to say, that the decision of the point\nStewart, in question was now before the public; that if his investigation was right it would never be overturned, and that if it was wrong it ought not to be defended. A few months before he published the essay just mentioned, he gave to the world another work, intitled Propositiones Geometricae More Veterum Demonstratae. This title, it is said, was given to it by Dr Simson, who rejoiced in the publication of a work so well calculated to promote the study of the ancient geometry. It consists of a series of geometrical theorems for the most part new; investigated first by an analysis, and afterwards synthetically demonstrated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a> of the same analysis.\n\nDr Stewart's constant use of the geometrical analysis had put him in possession of many valuable propositions which did not enter into the plan of any of the works that have been enumerated. Of these not a few have found a place in the writings of Dr Simson, where they will forever remain to mark the friendship of these two mathematicians, and to evince the esteem which Dr Simson entertained for the abilities of his pupil.\n\nSoon after the publication of the Sun's Distance, Dr Stewart's health began to decline, and the duties of his office became burdensome to him. In the year 1772 he retired to the country, where he afterwards spent the greater part of his life, and never resumed his labours in the university. But though mathematics had now ceased to be his business, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be his amusement till a very few years before his death, which happened on the 23rd of January 1785, at the age of 68.\n\nThe habits of study, in a man of original genius, are objects of curiosity, and deserve to be remembered. Concerning those of Dr Stewart, his writings have made it unnecessary to remark, that from his youth he had been accustomed to the most intense and continued application. In consequence of this application, added to the natural vigour of his mind, he retained the memory of his discoveries in a manner that will hardly be believed. He rarely wrote down any of his investigations till it became necessary to do so for the purpose of publication. When he discovered any proposition, he would put down the enunciation with great accuracy, and on the same piece of paper would construct very neatly the figure to which it referred. To these he trusted for recalling to his mind at any future period the demonstration or the analysis, however complicated it might be. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a> had taught him, that he might place this confidence in himself without any danger of disappointment; and for this singular power he was probably more indebted to the activity of his invention than the mere tenacity of his memory. Though he was extremely studious, he read few books, and verified the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of M. D'Alembert, that of all the men of letters, mathematicians read least of the writings of one another. His own investigations occupied him sufficiently; and indeed the world would have had reason to regret the misapplication of his talents, had he employed in the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of knowledge that time which he could dedicate to works of invention.","sp":332,"ep":335},{"h":"STEWARTIA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the class <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-MONADELPHIA\">monadelphia</a>, and in the natural system ranging under the 37th order, Columniferae.

To these three ways of stigmatizing St John is supposed to refer (Rev. chap. xiii. ver. 16, 17).

He was educated at St John's College, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; and having received holy orders, was, in 1657, presented to the rectory of Sutton in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTTINGHAMSHIRE\">Nottinghamshire</a>. By publishing his Origines Sacrae, one of the ablest defences of revealed religion that has ever been written, he soon acquired such reputation, that was appointed preacher of the Rolls Chapel; and in January 1665 was presented to the rectory of St Andrew's, Holborn. He was afterwards chosen lecturer at the Temple, and appointed chaplain in ordinary to King Charles II. In 1668 he took the degree of doctor of divinity; and was soon after engaged in a dispute with those of the Roman religion, by publishing his discourse concerning the idolatry and fanaticism of the church of Rome, which he afterwards defended against several antagonists. In 1680 he preached at Guildhall chapel a sermon on Phil. iii. 26, which he published under the title of The Mischief of Separation; and this being immediately attacked by several writers, he in 1683 published his Unreasonableness of Separation. In 1685 appeared his Origines Britannicae, or the Antiquities of the British Church, in folio. During the reign of King James II. he wrote several tracts against popery, and was procurator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>, as he had likewise been under Charles II. After the Revolution he was advanced to the bishopric of Worcester, and was engaged in a dispute with the Socinians, and also with Mr Locke; in which last contest he is generally thought to have been unsuccessful. He died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> in 1699, and Stillingfleet was interred in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Worcester, where a monument was erected to his memory by his son. Dr Stillingfleet wrote other works besides those here mentioned, which, with the above, have been reprinted in 6 vols. folio.\n\nStillingfleet, Benjamin, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> naturalist, was grandson of the preceding. His father Edward was fellow of St John's College in Cambridge, F.R.S. M.D. and Greatham professor of physic; but marrying in 1692, he lost his lucrative offices and his father's favour; a misfortune that affected both himself and his posterity. However, going into orders, he obtained, by his father's means, the living of Newington-Butts, which he immediately exchanged for that of Wood-Norton and Swanton in Norfolk. He died in 1708.\n\nBenjamin, his only son, was educated at Norwich school, which he left in 1720, with the character of an excellent scholar. He then went to Trinity-College in Cambridge, at the request of Dr Bentley, the master, who had been private tutor to his father, domestic chaplain to his grandfather, and much indebted to the family. Here he was a candidate for a fellowship, but was rejected by the master's influence. This was a severe and unexpected disappointment, and but little alleviated afterwards by the Doctor's apology, that it was a pity that a gentleman of Mr Stillingfleet's parts should be buried within the walls of a college.\n\nPerhaps, however, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a> of Dr Bentley was not of any real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to Mr Stillingfleet. By being thrown into the world, he formed many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and valuable connections. He dedicated some translations of Linnaeus to the late Lord Lyttleton, partly, he says, from motives of private respect and honour. Lord Barrington gave him, in a very polite manner, the place of the master of the barracks at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-KENNINGTON\">Kennington</a>; a favour to which Mr Stillingfleet, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> of his Calendar of Flora to that nobleman, alludes with equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, as well as with the warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>. His Calendar of Flora was formed at Stratton in Norfolk in the year 1755, at the hospitable seat of his very worthy and ingenious friend Mr Marsham, who had made several observations of that kind, and had communicated to the public his curious observations on the growth of trees. But it was to Mr Wyndham of Felbrigg in Norfolk that he appears to have had the greatest obligations: he travelled abroad with him, spent much of his time at his house, and was appointed one of his executors (Mr Garrick was another), with a considerable addition to an annuity which that gentleman had settled upon him in his lifetime.\n\nMr Stillingfleet's genius seems, if we may judge from his works, to have led him principally to the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>; which he prosecuted as an ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, an useful citizen, and a good man. In this walk of learning he mentions, as his friends, Dr Watson, Mr (afterwards Dr) Solander, Mr Hudson, Mr Price of Foxley, and some others; to whom may be added the ingenious Mr Pennant. Nor can we omit the flattering mention which Mr Gray makes of him in one of his letters, dated from London in 1761: \"I have lately made an acquaintance with this philosopher, who lives in a garret here in the winter, that he may support some near relations who depend upon him. He is always employed, consequently (according to my old maxim)\"\nmaxim) always happy, always cheerful, and seems to me a very worthy honest man. His present scheme is to send some persons, properly qualified, to reside a year or two in Attica, to make themselves acquainted with the climate, productions, and natural history of the country, that we may understand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>, &c. who have been heathen Greek to us for so many ages; and this he has got proposed to Lord Bute, no unlikely person to put it in execution, as he is himself a botanist.\"\n\nMr Stillingfleet published a volume of miscellaneous tracts, which is in much esteem, and does great honour to his head and heart. They are chiefly translations of some essays in the *Amantissae Academicae*, published by Linnaeus, interspersed with some observations and additions of his own. In this volume he shows also a taste for classical learning, and entertains us with some elegant poetical effusions of his own. But his Essay on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">Conversation</a>, published in the first volume of Doddley's Collection of Poems, entitles him to a distinguished rank among our English poets. This poem is addressed to Mr Wyndham, with all that warmth of friendship which distinguishes Mr Stillingfleet. As it is chiefly didactic, it does not admit of so many ornaments as some compositions of other kinds. However, it contains much good sense, shows a considerable knowledge of mankind, and has several passages that in point of harmony and easy versification would not disgrace the writings of our most admired poets. Here more than once Mr Stillingfleet shows himself still sore for Dr Bentley's cruel treatment of him; and towards the beautiful and moral side of it (where it is supposed he gives us a sketch of himself) seems to hint at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> of a more delicate nature, which he is said to have suffered from the other sex.\n\nTo these disappointments it was perhaps owing that Mr Stillingfleet neither married nor went into orders. His London residence was at a faddler's in Piccadilly; where he died in 1771, aged above 70, leaving several valuable papers behind him. He was buried in St James's church, without the slightest monument to his memory.","sp":336,"ep":337},{"h":"STILLINGIA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the class monocotyledons, and to the order of monocotyledons.

In his youth he had been addicted to licentious pleasures, from which he religiously refrained from the moment that he ranked himself among philosophers. When Ptolemy Soter, at the taking of Megara, offered him a large sum of money, and requested that he would accompany him into Egypt, he accepted but a small part of the offer, and retired to the island of \u00c6gina, whence, on Ptolemy's departure, he returned to Megara. That city being again taken by Demetrius the son of Antigonus, and the philosopher required to give an account of any effects which he had lost during the hurry of the plunder, he replied, that he had lost nothing; for no one could take from him his learning and eloquence. So great was the fame of Stilpo, that the most eminent philosophers of Athens took pleasure in attending upon his discourses. His peculiar doctrines were, that species or universals have no real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, and that one thing cannot be predicated of another. With respect to the former of these opinions, he seems to have taught the same doctrine with the sect afterwards known by the appellation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOMINALISTS\">Nominalists</a>. To prove that one thing cannot be predicated of another, he said, that *goodness* and *man*, for instance, are different things, which cannot be confounded by afflicting the one to be the other; he argued farther, that *goodness* is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, and universals have no real existence; consequently since nothing cannot be predicated of any thing, *goodness* cannot be predicated of man. Thus, whilst this subtle logician was, through his whole argument, precluding one thing of another, he denied that any one thing could be the accident or predicate of another. If Stilpo was serious in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>; if he meant any thing more than to expose the sophistry of the schools, he must be confessed to have been an eminent master of the art of wrangling; and it was not wholly without reason that Glycera, a celebrated courtezan, when she was reproved by him as a corrupter of youth, replied, that the charge might be justly retorted upon himself, who spent his time in filling their heads with sophistical quibbles and useless subtleties. In ethics he seems to have been a Stoic, and in religion he had a public and a private doctrine, the former for the multitude, and the latter for his friends.

Long. 3\u00b0 50' N. Lat. 56\u00b0 6'. It is also called Sterling and Striveling; from the former of which Boethius falsely derives the name Sterling money; because, says he, Olfelt, a Saxon prince, after the overthrow of the Scots, established a mint there. The name of Striveling is said to have been derived from the frequency of skirmishes or conflicts in the neighbourhood. The town contains about 4000 inhabitants. It has a manufacture of tartans and thalboons, and employs about 30 looms in that of carpets. The great street is very broad. In it is the tolbooth, where is kept the standard for the wet measures of Scotland. The other streets are narrow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>.\u2014Stirling is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a> a resemblance of Edinburgh; being built on a rock of the same form, with a fortres on the summit. The origin of the castle is unknown. The rock of Stirling was strongly fortified by the Piets, amongst whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> and several other useful arts had made a considerable progress. As it lay in the extremities of their kingdom, the possession of it was the occasion of frequent contests betwixt them and their neighbours the Scots and Northumbrians; each of whose dominions did, for some time, terminate near it.\n\nWhen the Scots, under Kenneth II., overthrew the Pictish empire near the middle of the ninth century, they endeavoured to obliterate every memorial of that people. They not only gave new names to provinces and towns, but, with all the rage of barbarians, demolished many magnificent and useful edifices which had been reared up by them, and this fortres among the rest. It was, however, soon rebuilt, though upon an occasion not very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to the Scots.\n\nUpon the death of Kenneth II., in 855, his brother Donald V. mounted the throne of Scotland. In the beginning of his reign the kingdom was invaded by Olbrecht and Ella, two Northumbrian princes, who, uniting their forces with the Cumbrian Britons, and a number of Piets, who upon their expulsion from their native country had taken refuge in England, advanced to Jedburgh, where Donald encountered them; and, after a fierce and bloody battle, obtained a complete victory: but, having taken up his station in Berwick, in supine security, the Northumbrians, informed of the carelefs posture in which the Scottish army lay, surprized them by a hasty march, dispersed them, and made a prisoner of the king. Pursuing the advantage they had gained, they marched northward, and subdued all before them to the frith of Forth and the town of Stirling. But the forlorn situation of the Scots, without a king and without an army, obliging them to sue for peace, they obtained it, upon condition that they should pay a sum of money for the ransom of the king, and yield up all their dominions upon the south side of the Forth to the conquerors.\n\nThe Northumbrians taking possession of the territories ceded to them by this treaty, rebuilt the castle of Stirling, and planted it with a strong garrison, in order to preserve their new conquests, upon the frontiers of which it was situated. Our authorities also inform us, that they erected a stone bridge over the Forth, upon the summit of which a cross was raised, with the following inscription in monkifh rhyme.\n\nAnglos a Scotia separat crux ista remotis;\nArmis hic stant Brutis, Scotti stant hic, cruce tuti.\n\nWhich is thus translated by Bellenden.\n\nI am free marche, as passengeris may ken,\nTo Scottis, to Britonis, and to Inglistmen.\n\nNone of the ancient English historians mentions this conquest. The whole story, as well as the inscription,\nwears much of a monkish garb; yet its authenticity is not a little confirmed by the arms of the town of Stirling, upon which is a bridge, with a cross, and the last line of the above Latin ditich is the motto round it.\n\nWe must not, however, imagine, that in those times that fortresses bore any resemblance to the present structure, which is adapted to the use of firearms. Its size and form probably resembled those castles which, under the feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, the English and Scottish barons used to erect upon their estates for dwelling-houses; and which, in those barbarous ages, they found necessary to fortify for their defence, not only against foreign invaders, but often against the attacks of their own neighbours. It is directly such a Gothic figure as this which represents the Castrum Strivelense upon the arms of Stirling.\n\nThis fortress, after it had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the possession of the Northumbrian Saxons about 20 years, was, together with the whole country upon the south side of the Forth, restored to the Scots, upon condition of their afflicting the Saxons against their turbulent invaders the Danes. Upon the arms of Stirling are two branches of a tree, to represent the Nensis Strivelense; but the situation and boundaries of that fortress, which was probably a wing of the Caledonian, cannot be ascertained. Upon the south of Stirling, vestiges of a forest are still discernible for several miles. Banks of natural timber still remain in the castle park, at Murray's wood, and near Nether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BANNOCKBURN\">Bannockburn</a>; and stumps of trees, with much brughwood, are to be seen in all the adjacent fields.\n\nWhen Kenneth III received intelligence of the Danes having invaded his dominions, he appointed the castle of Stirling to be the place of rendezvous for his army; and he marched from thence to the battle of Loncarty, where he obtained a victory over those rovers, in the end of the 10th century.\n\nIn the 12th century, this castle is spoken of as a place of great importance, and one of the strongest fortresses in the kingdom. In 1174, a calamity, not unusual amongst the Scottish monarchs, befell William, who at that time occupied the throne. He was taken prisoner in an unsuccessful expedition which he made into England; and, after having been detained 12 months in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, was released, upon stipulating to pay a large sum of money for his ransom; and, until payment thereof, delivering into the hands of the English the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fortresses in the kingdom, which in those days were Stirling, Edinburgh, Roxburgh, and Berwick. This was the first great advantage that England obtained over Scotland; and indeed the most important transaction which had passed between these kingdoms from the Norman conquest.\n\nThough the Scottish monarchs, in their frequent perambulations through the kingdom, often visited Stirling, and held their courts for some time in the castle; yet it did not become a royal residence till the family of Stuart mounted the throne, and it was from different princes of this family that it received its present form. It was the place of the nativity of James II.; and, when raised to the throne, he frequently kept his court in it. It is well known to have been the place where that prince perpetrated an atrocious deed, the murder of William earl of Douglas, whom he stabbed with his own hand. The royal apartments were at that time in the north-west corner of the castle, and are now the residence of the Stirling fort-major. The room where the murder was committed still goes by the name of Douglas's room.\n\nJames III., contracting fondness for the castle on account of its pleasant situation, made it the chief place of his residence, and added several embellishments to it. He built within it a magnificent hall, which in those days was deemed a noble structure, and is still entire. It now goes by the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>-house, having been designed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of that supreme court. It was covered with an oaken roof of exquisite workmanship, which, though very little decayed, was a few years ago removed to make way for one of more modern structure. James also erected a college of secular priests in the castle, which he called the chapel royal, and which proved one cause of his own ruin. As the expenses necessary for maintaining the numerous officers of such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> were considerable, he annexed to it the revenues of the rich priory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLDINGHAM\">Coldingham</a> in the Merse, which at that time happened to become vacant. This priory had for a long time been held by persons connected with the family of Hume; and that family, considering it as belonging to them, strongly opposed the annexation. The dispute seems to have lasted several years; for one parliament had passed a vote, annexing the priory to the chapel-royal, and a subsequent one enacted a statute prohibiting every attempt that was contrary or prejudicial to that annexation.\n\nJames V. was crowned in the castle of Stirling; and the palace, which is the chief ornament of it, was the work of that prince. This is a stately and commodious structure, all of hewn stone, with much statuary work upon it. It is built in form of a square, with a small court in the middle, in which the king's lions are said to have been kept; and hence it still goes by the name of the lions den. The palace contains many large and elegant apartments; the ground-floor is now converted into barrack-rooms for the soldiers of the garrison; the upper affords a house for the governor, with lodgings for some of the subaltern officers.\n\nOpposite to the palace, upon the north, stands an elegant chapel, which was built by James VI. for the baptism of his son, Prince Henry, in 1594. In this chapel is preserved the hulk of a large boat, which that whimsical monarch caused to be built and placed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, in order to convey into the castle the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for that solemnity.\n\nA strong battery, with a tier of guns pointing to the bridge over the Forth, was erected during the regency of Mary of Lorraine, mother to Queen Mary. It is called the French battery, probably because constructed by engineers of that nation. The last addition was made to the fortifications in the reign of Queen Anne. Formerly they reached no farther than the old gate, upon which the flag-staff now stands; but in that reign they were considerably enlarged upon the side towards the town; and barracks, which are bomb-proof, with several other conveniences for a siege, were erected.\n\nUpon the south side of the castle lies a park inclosed with a stone-wall, called the king's park, and near to the foot of the rock on which the castle stands, lay the royal gardens; vestiges of the walks and parterres, with a few stumps of fruit-trees, are still visible; but by long neglect, and the natural wetness of the soil, the place is now\nnow little better than a marsh. In the gardens is a mount of earth in form of a table, with benches of earth around it, where, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, the court sometimes held feasts-champetres. In the castle-hill is an hollow, comprehending about an acre of ground, and having all the appearance of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> work, which was used for jousts, tournaments, and other feats of chivalry.\n\nNorthward of the castle lies the Govan, or perhaps more properly the Gowling hill (A); in the middle of which is a small mound called Hurly Haaky, upon which Duke Murdoch and his two sons were executed for treasonable practices in the reign of James I.\n\nThe prospect from the castle is most delightful, as well as extensive, being greatly beautified, especially upon the east, by the windings of the Forth; which are so numerous, that though the distance by land from Stirling to Alloa is, in a straight line, not quite six miles, it is said to be 24 by water. As this river generally runs upon plain ground, it rolls its stream in so slow and silent a manner, that what Silius Italicus faith of the Ticinus is applicable to it, if, instead of lucens in that poet, we should read luens; for the clay-banks, together with the tide, which flows above Stirling, render the Forth perpetually muddy:\n\nVix credas labi, ripis tam mitis opacis\nSomniferam ducit luolo gurgite lympham.\n\nThe lordship and castle of Stirling were a part of the usual dowry of the queens of Scotland, at least after the family of Stuart came to the throne, in which they were invested at their marriage.\n\nRobert lord Erskine was appointed governor of the castle by King David II. and the office continued in that family till 1715.\n\nThis fortress hath been the scene of many transactions. Being by its situation considered as a key to the northern parts of the kingdom, the possession of it hath been always esteemed of great importance to those who sought to be masters of Scotland. It was undoubtedly a place of strength when the art of war by ordnance was in its infancy; but though it resisted the utmost efforts of the rebels in 1746, it could not now hold out three days if besieged by an army of a few thousand men, conducted by an engineer of knowledge and integrity.","sp":338,"ep":340},{"h":"STIRLINGSHIRE","t":"a county of Scotland, of which Stirling is the capital.

The want of them in getting upon horseback was supplied by agility or art. Some horses were taught to stoop to take their riders upon; but the riders often leapt up by the help of their spears, or were assisted by their slaves, or made use of ladders for the purpose. Gr\u00e6cchus filled the highways with stones, which were intended to answer the same end. The same was also required of the surveyors of the roads in Greece as part of their duty.\n\nMenage observes, that St Jerome is the first author who mentions them. But the passage alluded to is not to be found in his epistles; and if it were there, it would prove nothing, because St Jerome lived at a time when stirrups are supposed to have been invented, and after the use of saddles.

Long. 19\u00b0 30' and N. Lat. 59\u00b0 23'. Its foundation is by the best Swedish writers generally attributed to Birger Jarl, regent of the kingdom about the middle of the 13th century during the minority of his son Waldemar, who had been raised to the throne by the states of the kingdom; but it was not before the 18th century that the royal residence was transferred from Upsala to this city.\n\nThis capital, which is very long and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, occupies, beside two peninsulas, seven small rocky islands, scattered in the M\u00e4laren, in the streams which issue from that lake, and in a bay of the gulf of Bothnia. A variety of contrasted and enchanting views are formed by numberless rocks of granite rising boldly from the surface of the water, partly bare and craggy, partly dotted with houses, or feathered with wood. The harbour is an inlet of the Baltic: the water is clear as crystal, and of such depth that ships of the largest burthen can approach the quay, which is of considerable breadth, and Core's Tra- lined with spacious buildings and ware houses. At the extremity of the harbour several streets rise one above another in the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>; and the palace, a magnificent building, crowns the summit. Towards the sea, about two or three miles from the town, the harbour is contracted into a narrow strait, and, winding among high rocks, disappears from the sight; and the prospect is terminated by distant hills, overspread with forest. It is far beyond the power of words, or of the Stockholm pencil, to delineate these singular views. The central island, from which the city derives its name, and the Ritterholm, are the handsomest parts of the town. Excepting in the suburbs, where the houses are of wood painted red, the generality of the buildings are of stone, or brick fluecoated white. The royal palace, which stands in the centre of Stockholm, and upon the highest spot of ground, was begun by Charles XI.; it is a large quadrangular stone edifice, and the style of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> is both elegant and magnificent.\n\nIt is the habitation not only of the royal family, but also of the greater part of the officers belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>. It likewise comprehends the national or supreme court of justice, the colleges of war, chancery, treasury, and commerce; a chapel, armory, library, and office for the public records; but the greater number of inferior officers and servants belonging to the court, are, with the foot-guards, quartered on the burghe rs. The cattle, and all the flatly edifices in the kingdom, are covered with copper. The palace of the nobility, in which this order sits during the session of the diet, is an elegant building adorned on the outside with marble statues and columns, and on the inside with painting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>. This and three other palaces stand on the banks of the lake, and are built on the same model, so as to compose an uniform piece of architecture. The bank, built at the expense of the city, is a noble edifice, and joins with many sumptuous houses belonging to the nobility in exhibiting a splendid appearance. The houses of the burghe rs are generally built of brick in the city; but in the suburbs they are commonly made up of timber, and therefore very subject to conflagrations. These houses are often framed in Finland, according to the plan and dimensions prescribed: whence they are transported in pieces to Stockholm by water, and there set up by the carpenters. These wooden habitations, if kept in proper repair, will last 30 or 40 years, and are deemed warmer, neater, and more healthy, than those of brick or stone. To prevent the danger of conflagrations, the city is divided into 12 wards. In each of these there is a master and four assistants, who forthwith repair to the place where the fire breaks out; and all porters and labourers are obliged to range themselves under the master of the ward to which they belong.

The greatest inconveniences attending this situation are, the distance from the sea, which is not within less than 10 miles of the town; the want of tides; and the winding of the river, which is remarkably crooked.

Anciently, the only stockings in use were made of cloth, or of milled stuffs sewed together; but since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of knitting and weaving stockings of silk, wool, cotton, thread, &c., the use of cloth stockings is quite discontinued. Dr Howel, in his History of the World (vol. ii. p. 222.) relates, that Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, in 1501, was presented with a pair of black knit silk stockings by her silk-woman, and thenceforth she never wore cloth ones any more. The same author adds, that King Henry VIII. ordinarily wore cloth hose, except there came from Spain, by great chance, a pair of silk stockings. His son, King Edward VI., was presented with a pair of long Spanish silk stockings by Sir Thomas Greham, and the present was then much taken notice of. Hence it should seem, that the invention of silk knit stockings originally came from Spain. Others relate, that one William Hider, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> on London bridge, seeing at the house of an Italian merchant a pair of knit worsted stockings from Mantua, took the hint, and made a pair exactly like them, which he presented to William earl of Pembroke, and that they were the first of that kind worn in England, anno 1564.\n\nThe modern stockings, whether woven or knit, are formed of an infinite number of little knots, called stitches, loops, or meshes, intermingled in one another.\n\nKnit stockings are wrought with needles made of polished iron or brass wire, which interlace the threads and form the meshes the stocking consists of. At what time the art of knitting was invented it is perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to determine, though it has usually been attributed to the Scots, as it is said that the first works of this kind came from Scotland. It is added, that it was on this account that the company of stocking-knitters, established at Paris 1527, took for their patron St Fiacre, who is said to have been the son of a king of Scotland. But it is most probable that the method of knitting stockings by wires or needles was first brought from Spain.\n\nWoven stockings are generally very fine; they are manufactured on a frame, or machine made of polished iron, the structure of which it is needless to describe, as it may be seen in almost every considerable town in Great Britain. The invention of this machine is, by Mr Anderson, attributed to William Lee, M.A. of St John's College, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, at a period so early as 1589. Others have given the credit of this invention to a student of Oxford at a much later period, who, it is said by Aaron Hill*, was driven to it by dire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. This young man, falling in love with an innkeeper's daughter, married her though he had not a penny, and he by his marriage lost a fellowship. They soon fell into extreme poverty; and their marriage producing the consequences naturally to be expected from it, the amorous pair became miserable, not so much on account of their sufferings, as from the melancholy dread of what would become of their yet unborn infant. Their only means of support were the knitting of stockings, at which the woman was very expert: \"But fixing constantly together from morning to night, and the scholar often fixing his eyes, with steadfast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, on the motion of his wife's fingers in the dexterous management of her needles, he took it into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, that it was not impossible to contrive a little loom which might do the work with much more expedition. This thought he communicated to his wife, and joining his head to her hands, the endeavour succeeded to their wish. Thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> stocking-loom, which is so common now, was first invented; by which he did not only make himself and his family happy, but has left his nation indebted to him for a benefit which enables us to export silk stockings in great quantities, and to a vast advantage, to those very countries from whence before we used to bring them at considerable loss in the balance of our traffic.\"","sp":342,"ep":342},{"h":"STOCKS","t":"or PUBLIC FUNDS IN ENGLAND. By the word stock was originally meant a particular sum of money contributed to the establishing a fund to enable a company to carry on a certain trade, by means of which the person became a partner in that trade, and received a share of the profit made thereby, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the money employed. But this term has been extended farther, though improperly, to signify any sum of money which has been lent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, on condition of receiving a certain interest till the money is repaid, and which makes a part of the national debt. As the security both of the government and of the public companies is esteemed preferable to that of any private person, as the stocks are negotiable and may be sold at any time, and as the interest is always punctually paid when due; so they are thereby enabled to borrow money on a lower interest than what could be obtained from lending it to private persons, where there must be always some danger of losing both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and interest.\n\nBut as every capital stock or fund of a company is raised for a particular purpose, and limited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> to a certain sum, it necessarily follows, that when that fund is completed, no stock can be bought of the company; though shares already purchased may be transferred from one person to another. This being the case, there is frequently a great disproportion between the original value of the shares and what is given for them when transferred; for if there are more buyers than sellers, a person who is indifferent about selling will not part with his share without a considerable profit to himself; and on the contrary, if many are disposed to sell, and few inclined to buy, the value of such shares will naturally fall in proportion to the impatience of those who want to turn their stock into specie.\n\nA stock may likewise be affected by the court of chancery; for if that court should order the money, which is under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, to be laid out in any particular stock, that stock, by having more purchasers, will be raised to a higher price than any other of the like value.\n\nBy what has been said, the reader will perceive how much the credit and interest of the nation depends on the support of the public funds.

Born a son of a gardener of the duke of Argyle, he arrived at eight years of age before he learnt to read.\u2014By chance a servant having taught young Stone the letters of the alphabet, there needed nothing more to discover and expand his genius. He applied himself to study, and he arrived at the knowledge of the most sublime geometry and analysis, without a master, without a conductor, without any other guide but pure genius.\n\n\"At 18 years of age he had made these considerable advances without being known, and without knowing himself the prodigies of his acquisitions. The duke of Argyle, who joined to his military talents a general knowledge of every science that adorns the mind of a man of his rank, walking one day in his garden, saw lying on the grass a Latin copy of Sir Isaac Newton's celebrated Principia. He called some one to him to take and carry it back to his library. Our young gardener told him that the book belonged to him. 'To you?' replied the duke. 'Do you understand geometry, Latin, Newton?' I know a little of them, replied the young man with an air of simplicity arising from a profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of his own knowledge and talents. The duke was surprised; and having a taste for the sciences, he entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> with the young mathematician: he asked him several questions, and was astonished at the force, the accuracy, and the candour of his answers. 'But how (said the duke), came you by the knowledge of all these things?' Stone replied, 'A servant taught me, ten years since, to read: Does one need to know anything more than the 24 letters in order to learn everything else that one wishes?' The duke's curiosity redoubled\u2014he sat down upon a bank, and requested a detail of all his proceedings in becoming so learned.\n\n'I first learned to read, said Stone: the masters were then at work upon your house: I went near them one day, and I saw that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> used a rule, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>, and that he made calculations. I inquired what might be the meaning and use of these things; and I was informed that there was a science called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a>: I purchased a book of arithmetic, and I learned it.\u2014I was told there was another science called Geometry: I bought the books, and I learnt geometry. By reading I found that there were good books in these two sciences in Latin: I bought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>, and I learned Latin. I understood also that there were good books of the same kind in French: I bought a dictionary, and I learned French. And this, my lord, is what I have done: it seems to me that we may learn everything when we know the 24 letters of the alphabet.\"\n\n\"This account charmed the Duke. He drew this wonderful...\"\nwonderful genius out of his obscurity; and he provided him with an employment which left him plenty of time to apply himself to the sciences. He discovered in him also the same genius for music, for painting, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, for all the sciences which depend on calculations and proportions.\"\n\n\"I have seen Mr Stone. He is a man of great simplicity. He is at present sensible of his own knowledge; but he is not puffed up with it. He is possessed with a pure and disinterested love for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, though he is not solicitous to pass for a mathematician; vanity having no part in the great labour he sustains to excel in that science. He despises fortune also; and he has solicited me twenty times to request the duke to give him less employment, which may not be worth the half of that he now has, in order to be more retired, and less taken off from his favourite studies. He discovers sometimes, by methods of his own, truths which others have discovered before him. He is charmed to find on these occasions that he is not a first inventor, and that others have made a greater progress than he thought. Far from being a plagiarist, he attributes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> solutions, which he gives to certain problems, to the hints he has found in others, although the connection is but very distant,\" &c.\n\nMr Stone was author and translator of several useful works; viz. 1. A New Mathematical Dictionary, in 2 vol. 8vo, first printed in 1726. 2. Fluxions, in 1 vol. 8vo, 1730. The Direct Method is a translation from the French, of Hobart's Analyse des Infiniments Petits; and the Inverse Method was supplied by Stone himself. 3. The Elements of Euclid, in 2 vol. 8vo, 1731. A neat and useful edition of those Elements, with an account of the life and writings of Euclid, and a defence of his Elements against modern objectors. Besides other smaller works. Stone was a fellow of the Royal Society, and had inserted in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. xlii. p. 218), an \"Account of two species of lines of the 3rd order, not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton or Mr Stirling.\"\n\nStone, Jerome, the son of a reputable seaman, was born in the parish of Scoonie, in the county of Fife, North Britain. His father died abroad when he was but three years of age, and his mother, with her young family, was left in very narrow circumstances. Jerome, like the rest of the children, having got the ordinary school education, reading English, writing, and arithmetic, betook himself to the business of a travelling chapman. But the dealing in buckles, garters, and such small articles, not suiting his superior genius, he soon converted his little stock into books, and for some years went through the country, and attended the fairs as an itinerant bookseller. There is great reason to believe that he engaged in this new species of traffic, more with a view to the improvement of his mind than for any pecuniary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>. Formed by nature for literature, he possessed a peculiar talent for acquiring languages with amazing facility. Whether from a desire to understand the Scriptures in their original languages, or from being informed that these languages are the parents of many others, he began his philological pursuits with the study of the Hebrew and Greek tongues; and, by a wonderful effort of genius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, made himself so far master of these, without any kind of assistance, as to be able to interpret the Hebrew Bible and Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> into English ad aperturam libri. At this time he did not know one word of Latin. Sensible that he could make no great progress in learning, without the knowledge of at least the grammar of that language, he made application to the parish schoolmaster for his affluence. Some time afterwards, he was encouraged to prosecute his studies at the university of St Andrews. An unexampled proficiency in every branch of literature recommended him to the esteem of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a>; and an uncommon fund of wit and pleasantry rendered him, at the same time, the favourite of all his fellow students, some of whom speak of him to this day with an enthusiastic degree of admiration and respect. About this period some very humorous poetical pieces of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> were published in the Scots Magazine. Before he had finished his third session, or term, at St Andrew's, on an application to the college by the master of the school of Dunkeld for an usher, Mr Stone was recommended as the best qualified for that office; and about two or three years after, the master being removed to Perth, Mr Stone, by the favour of his Grace the Duke of Atholl, who had conceived a high opinion of his abilities, was appointed his successor.\n\nWhen he first went to Dunkeld, he entertained but an unfavourable opinion of the Gaelic language, which he considered as nothing better than a barbarous inarticulate gibberish; but being bent on investigating the origin and descent of the ancient Scots, he suffered not his prejudices to make him neglect the study of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> tongue. Having, with his usual affability and success, mastered the grammatical difficulties which he encountered, he set himself to discover something of the true genius and character of the language. He collected a number of ancient poems, the productions of Irish or Scottish bards, which, he said, were daring, innocent, passionate, and bold. Some of these poems were translated into English verse, which several persons now alive have seen in manuscript, before Mr Macpherson published any of his translations from Ossian.\n\nHe died while he was writing and preparing for the press a treatise, intitled, \"An Inquiry into the Original of the Nation and Language of the ancient Scots, with Conjectures about the Primitive State of the Celtic and other European Nations?\" an idea which could not have been conceived by an ordinary genius. In this treatise he proves that the Scots drew their original, as well as their language, from the ancient Gauls. Had Mr Stone lived to finish this work, which discovers great ingenuity, immense reading, and indefatigable industry, it would have thrown light upon the dark and early periods of the Scottish history, as he opens a new and plain path for leading us through the unexplored labyrinths of antiquity. But a fever put an end to his life, his labours, and his usefulness, in the year 1757, being then only in the 30th year of his age. He left, in manuscript, a much esteemed and well-known allegory, intitled \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">Immortality</a> of Authors,\" which has been published and often reprinted since his death, and will be a lasting monument of a lively fancy, sound judgment, and correct taste. It was no small ornament of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> character, that he paid a pious regard to his aged mother, who survived him two years, and received an annual pension from the Duchess of Atholl as a testimony of respect to the memory of her son.","sp":343,"ep":344},{"h":"STONE","t":"in merchandize, denotes a certain weight for weighing commodities.

It is inclosed by a circular double bank and ditch near 30 feet broad, after crossing which we ascend 30 yards before we reach the work. The whole fabric consists of two circles and two ovals. The outer circle is about 108 feet diameter, consisting when entire of 60 stones, 30 uprights and 30 imposts, of which remain only 24 uprights, 17 standing and 7 down, 3\u00bd feet slumber, and 8 imposts. Eleven uprights have their 5 imposts on them by the grand entrance. These stones are from 13 to 20 feet high. The lesser circle is somewhat more than 8 feet from the inside of the outer one, and consisted of 40 lesser stones (the highest 6 feet), of which only 19 remain, and only 11 standing: the walk between these two circles is 300 feet in circumference. The Adytum or Cell is an oval formed of 10 stones (from 16 to 22 feet high), in pairs, with imposts, which Dr Stukeley calls trilithons, and above 30 feet high, rising in height as they go round, and each pair separate, and not connected as the outer pair; the highest 8 feet. Within these are 10 more smaller flint stones, of which only 6 are standing. At the upper end of the Adytum is the altar, a large slab of blue coarse marble, 26 inches thick, 16 feet long, and 4 broad; pressed down by the weight of the vast stones that have fallen upon it. The whole number of stones, uprights, imposts, and altar, is exactly 140. The stones are far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>, but were most probably brought from those called the Grey Weathers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a> Downs, 15 or 16 miles off; and if tried with a tool they appear of the same hardness, grain, and colour, generally reddish. The heads of oxen, deer, and other beasts, have been found on digging in and about Stonehenge; and human bones in the circumjacent barrows. There are three entrances from the plain to this structure, the most considerable of which is from the north-east, and at each of them were raised on the outside of the trench two huge stones with two smaller within parallel to them.\n\nIt has been long a dispute among the learned, by what nation, and for what purpose, these enormous stones were collected and arranged. The first account of this structure we meet with is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-GEOFFROY_OF_MONMOUTH\">Geoffroy of Monmouth</a>, who, in the reign of King Stephen, wrote the history of the Britons in Latin. He tells us, that it was erected by the counsel of Merlin the British enchanter, at the command of Aurelius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-AMBROSIUS\">Ambrosius</a> the last British king, in memory of 460 Britons who were murdered by Hengist the Saxon. The next account is that of Polydore Virgil, who says that the Britons erected this as a sepulchral monument of Aurelius Ambrosius. Others suppose it to have been a sepulchral monument of Boadicea the famous British queen. Inigo Jones is of opinion, that it was a Roman temple; from a stone 16 feet long, and four broad, placed in an exact position to the eastward altar-fashion. Mr Charlton attributed it to the Danes, who were two years masters of Wiltshire. A tin tablet, on which were some unknown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, supposed to be Punic, was dug up near it in the reign of Henry VIII. but is lost; probably that might have given some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> respecting its founders. Its common name, Stonehenge, is Saxon, and signifies a \"stone gallows,\" to which those stones, having transverse imposts, bear some resemblance. It is also called in Welsh choir gour, or \"the giants dance.\"\n\nMr Grofe thinks that Dr Stukeley has completely proved this structure to have been a British temple in which the Druids officiated. He supposes it to have been the metropolitan temple of Great Britain, and\ntranslates the words choir gour \"the great choir or temple.\" The learned Mr Bryant is of opinion that it was erected by a colony of Cuthites probably before the time of the Druids; because it was usual with them to place one vast stone upon another for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> memorial; and these they often placed so equably, that even a breath of wind would sometimes make them vibrate. Of such stones one remains at this day in the pile of Stonehenge. The ancients distinguished stones erected with a religious view, by the name of amber; by which was signified any thing solar and divine. The Grecians called them \u1f00\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9, petrae ambrosiae. Stonehenge, according to Mr Bryant, is composed of these amber stones: hence the next town is denominated Ambrosbury; not from a Roman Ambrofus, for no such person ever existed, but from the ambrosiac petrae, in whose vicinity it stood. Some of these were rocking stones; and there was a wonderful monument of this sort near Penzance in Cornwall, which still retains the name of main-amber, or the sacred stones. Such a one is mentioned by Apollonius Rhodius, supposed to have been raised in the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGONAUTS\">Argonauts</a>, in the island Tinos, as the monument of the two-winged sons of Boreas, slain by Hercules; and there are others in China and other countries.","sp":361,"ep":362},{"h":"STONEHIVE","t":"STONEHIVE, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STONEHAVEN\">STONEHAVEN</a>, a small town in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KINCARDINE\">Kincardine</a>, Scotland, 15 miles south from Aberdeen.

When philosophers limit their inquiries within the boundaries of science, where they are led by the sober and safe conduct of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> and experiment, their conclusions may be solid and may be useful; but when, throwing experiment and observation aside, they rear a theory upon an airy nothing, or upon a single detached fact, their theories will vanish before the touch of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> as a romantic palace before the rod of the enchanter. Sometimes from whim, or caprice, or vanity, they attempt to confound every thing: they wish to prove that the foul is mere matter, that plants are animals, and that fossils are plants, and thus would banish two substances, spirit and dead matter, entirely from the world; as if the Author of Nature were actuated by fordish views of parsimony in the works of creation, though we evidently see that a generous profusion is one of the characteristic marks of these works. We leave the talk of confounding the different classes of being to those philosophers whose minds are too contracted to comprehend a great variety of being at one view, or who prefer novelty to every thing else. We content ourselves with the old opinion, that the foul is a spiritual substance; that plants are plants, and that stones are stones.\n\nWe have been led into these remarks by finding that some philosophers say that stones are vegetables; that they grow and increase in size like a plant. This theory, we believe, was first offered to the world by M. Tournefort, in the year 1702, after returning from his travels in the east. It was founded on a curious fact. In surveying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LABYRINTH\">labyrinth</a> of Crete, he observed that the names which visitors had engraved upon the rock were not formed of hollow but of prominent letters like basaltic reliefs. He supposes that these letters were at first hollowed out by knives; that the hollows have since been filled up by the growth of the stone; and hence he concludes that stones vegetate. We wish we were fully assured of the fact that the letters were at first hollowed, before we attempt to account for their prominence. But even allowing the supposition to be true that they were at first hollow, we reply it is only a single fact, and that it is altogether unphilosophical to deduce a general system from a single fact.\n\nIn the second place, this protuberance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> is very improperly called vegetation, for it is not produced by a process in any respect like the vegetation of a plant. Vegetation supposes vessels containing fluids and growth by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>; but who ever heard of vessels in a stone, of fluids moving in them, or of the different parts expanding and swelling like the branch or trunk of a tree? Even the fact which Tournefort mentions proves nothing. He does not pretend to say, that the rock itself is increasing, but only that a few small hollows are filled with new stony matter, which rises a little above the surrounding surface of the rock. This matter evidently has been once liquid, and at length has congealed in the channel into which it had run. But is not this easily explained by a common process, the formation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALACTITES\">stalactites</a>? When water charged with calcareous matter is exposed to the action of air, the water evaporates, and leaves the calcareous earth behind, which hardens and becomes like a stone.\n\nHaving thus examined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fact upon which M. Tournefort founds his theory, it is unnecessary to follow him minutely through the rest of his subject. He compares the accretion of matter in the labyrinth to the consolidation of a bone when broken, by a callus formed of the extravasated nutritious juice. This observation is thought to be confirmed, by finding that the projecting matter of the letters is whitish and the rock itself greyish. But it is easy to find comparisons. The difficulty, as Pope says, is to apply them. The resemblance between the filling up of the hollow of a stone, and the consolidation of a broken bone by a callus, we confess ourselves not philosophers enough to see. Were we writing poetry in bad taste, perhaps it might appear. The circumstance, that the prominent matter of the letters is whitish, while the rock is greyish, we flatter ourselves strengthens our supposition that it consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of calcareous matter. Upon the whole, we conclude, we hope logically, that no such theory as this, that stones are vegetables, can be drawn from the supposed fact respecting the labyrinth. We have to regret, that the account which we have seen of the subject is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, that we have not sufficient materials for a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Tournefort has not even told us of what kind of stone or earth the accretion consists; yet this single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> would probably have decided the question (A).\n\nVol. XIX. Part II.\n\n---\n\n(A) To give a more distinct notion of Tournefort's theory, we shall subjoin his conclusions: From these observations (he says) it follows, that there are stones which grow in the quarries, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that are fed; that the same juice which nourishes them serves to rejoin their parts when broken; just as in the bones of animals, and the branches of trees, when kept up by bandages; and, in a word, that they vegetate.

In the article Ores, we have given a pretty full detail of the methods of analyzing that class of minerals. In this place we propose briefly to point out the most improved processes for the analysis of the other three classes of mineral bodies, viz., earths and stones, salts, and combustibles; to which we shall add some account of the method of examining soils.\n\nBut before proceeding to the immediate object of this treatise, it may be useful to make some observations on some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> processes connected with the subject under consideration.\n\nIn the first place, it is necessary that the mineral to be examined be reduced to a fine powder. To effect this with very hard stones, they are made red hot, and in this state thrown into cold water. By the sudden change of temperature in the different parts of the stone, it cracks, and falls to pieces. If the pieces be not sufficiently small, the same process is to be repeated. The fragments are then to be reduced to smaller pieces in a polished steel mortar, and the cavity of this mortar ought to be cylindrical. A pestle of the same metal should be made to fit it exactly, that no part of the stone may escape during the operation of pounding. The stone being in this way reduced to powder, a determinate quantity is taken, 100 or 200 grains, for example, and this is to be reduced to as fine a powder as possible; or, as it is called, to an impalpable powder. This operation is most successfully performed in an agate mortar, with a pestle of the same mineral; a mortar of about four inches in diameter, and rather more than one inch deep, is found to answer the purpose very well. It is found most convenient to operate on small quantities only at a time; not more than five or six grains. When the powder feels soft, adheres, and appears under the pestle in the form of a cake, it is then as fine as possible. It is now to be accurately weighed, and it is usually found to have acquired some additional weight, arising from part of the mortar being worn off during the pounding. This additional weight must be attended to, and after the analysis is completed, a part of the substance of the mortar must be subtracted. In the case of an agate or flint mortar being used, the portion rubbed off, which increases the weight, may be regarded as pure filaceous earth.\n\nThe chemical vessels necessary for the analysis of minerals are crucibles for exposing the substances to heat, preliminary glazes and shallow dishes for solutions and evaporations. Processes. The crucibles should be of platinum or pure silver, and of such a capacity as to hold from seven to eight cubic inches of water. The vessels in which the solutions, evaporations, and other processes are performed, should be of glass or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a>; the glass vessels, as being more brittle, and therefore more apt to break, are found to be less economical than those of porcelain. Some chemists employ porcelain vessels which are in the form of sections of spheres, and are glazed both in the inside and outside, excepting part of the bottom, which comes into immediate contact with the fire. Wedgwood's glazed vessels for evaporations, are found to answer very well; the glaze is thin, and the vessels are not very apt to crack; but it is supposed by some chemists, that it is occasionally acted on by strong acids. It is scarcely necessary to add, that an accurate balance is a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in the hands of the analyst.\n\nI.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">PNEUMATICS</a> we also attended to the manner in which our fires immediately operate in warming our apartments. At present, when about to describe a method of warming intrinsically different, we must pay some more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the distinguishing circumstance. Without pretending to explain the physical connection of heat and light, it may suffice to observe, that heat, as well as light, is communicated to distant bodies in an instant by radiation. A person passing hastily by the door of a glass-house feels the glow of heat in the very moment he sees the dazzling light of the furnace mouth, and it is interrupted by merely screening his face with his hand. In this way is an apartment partly warmed by an open fire; and we avoid the oppressive heat by fitting where the fire is not seen, or by interposing a screen. We are apt to connect this so strongly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> with the light emitted by the fire, that we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the heat to the immediate action of the light. But this opinion is shown to be gratuitous by a curious experiment made before the Royal Society by Dr Hooke, and afterwards, with more care and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, by Mr Scheele. They found, that by bringing a plate of the most transparent glass briskly between the fire and one's face, the heat is immediately intercepted without any sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the light. Scheele, by a very pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, discovered that the glass made the separation, and did it both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a> and reflection; for he found, that when the light of the same fire was collected into a focus by means of a polished metal concave speculum, a thermometer placed there was infinitely affected. But if we employ a glass speculum foiled in the usual manner with quicksilver, of the same diameter and focal distance, and of equally brilliant reflection, there is hardly any sensible heat produced in the focus, and the thermometer must remain there for a very long while before it is sensibly affected. When we repeated this curious experiment, we found, that after the glass has remained a long while in this position, whether transmitting or reflecting the light, it loses in a great measure its power of intercepting the heat. By varying this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> in many of its circumstances, we think ourselves entitled to conclude, that the glass absorbs the heat which it intercepts, and is very quickly heated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>. While it rises in its own temperature, it intercepts the heat powerfully; but when it is, as it were, saturated, attracting no more than what it immediately imparts to the air in corporeal contact with it, the heat passes freely through along with the light. If\nthe glass be held so near the fire that the surrounding air is very much heated, no sensible interruption of heat is perceived after the glass is thus saturated. We found the cheek more quickly sensible than the thermometer of this instantaneous radiation of the heat which accompanies the light, or is separated from it in this experiment. It is a very instructive experiment in the physiology of heat.\n\nWe cannot say how far this radiation of heat may extend, nor whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPANIMENT\">accompaniment</a> of light is absolutely necessary. The mathematician proceeds on the supposition that it extends as far as the radiation of light, and that, being also rectilineal, the density of the heat is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to that of the light. But these notions are somewhat gratuitous; and there are appearances which render them doubtful. When with a lens of an inch in diameter we form a focus on a piece of black unpolished marble of an inch diameter, the mathematician must allow that no more rays fall on the marble than if the lens were away; therefore the marble should be equally warmed in either case. But it is by no means so, as we have repeatedly found by exposing it during equal times, and then dropping it into water. The water which is heated by the marble on which the focus has been formed will be found to have acquired from it much more heat than from the other. The tops of lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> which are never shaded by clouds, but enjoy perpetual sunshine and fertility, instead of being warmer than the valleys below, are covered with never-melting snow; and we have some grounds to suspect that the genial influence of the sun requires the cooperation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and to doubt whether there is any warmth at the moon, on which no atmosphere like ours can be observed. Perhaps the heat which cheers us, and fertilizes our earth, is chemically separated from our atmosphere by its elective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for the light of the sun. Our successors in the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">meteorology</a> need not fear that the subject of their research will be soon deprived of scientific allurements. We know but little of it after all the progress we have made during this last century, and it still presents an ample field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>.\n\nWe said that the accompaniment of light is not demonstrably necessary. We are certain that heat may be imparted without any sensible light, in a manner which we can hardly suppose anything but radiation. If a piece of very hot iron be placed a little without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> focus of a metallic concave speculum, and a very sensible air-thermometer be placed in its conjugate focus, it will instantly show an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of temperature, although the iron is quite imperceptible to an eye which has even been a long while in the dark. No such rise of temperature is observed if the thermometer be placed a little to one side of the focus of the speculum; therefore the phenomenon is precisely similar to the radiation of light. We are obliged therefore to acknowledge that the heat is radiated in this experiment in the same way that light is in the common optical experiments.\n\nAlthough this is the most usual way that we in this country employ fuel for warming our apartments, it is by no means the only way in which the heat diffused from this fuel may be imparted to distant bodies. It is not even the most effectual method; it is diffused also by immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> to bodies in contact. The air in immediate contact with the burning fuel is heated, and imparts some of its heat to the air lying beyond it, and this is partly shared with the air which is still farther off; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, by communication in contact, goes on till the remote air <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the walls, the floor, the ceiling, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, the company, all get a share of it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their attractions and their capacities. And as the air is thus continually supplied, and continually gives out heat, the walls, &c., become gradually warmer, and the room becomes comfortable and pleasant. But we apprehend that no great proportion of the heat actually acquired by the room is communicated in this way. This diffusion by contact is but slow, especially in air which is very dry; so slow indeed, that the air in the immediate neighbourhood of the fuel is hurried up the chimney before it has time to impart any of the heat received in contact. We know that the time employed in diffusing itself in this way through stagnant air to any moderate distance is very considerable. We imagine therefore that the heat communicated to our rooms by an open fire is chiefly by radiation, but in a way something different from what we mentioned before. We imagine, that as the piece of glass in Dr Hooke's experiment absorbs the heat, so the whole mass of air which fills the room intercepts the radiated heat in every part of the room where the fire is seen, and is as it were saturated with it throughout, and ready to impart it to every body immersed in it. We cannot otherwise account for the equality of the heat in the different parts of the room. More radiation on the solid bodies would warm them in the inverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> ratio of their distances from the fire; and diffusion by contact, if compatible with the rapid current up the chimney, would heat the room still more unequally. Recollect how slowly, and with what rapid diminution of intensity, the colour of blue vitriol is communicated to water even to a very small distance. But because all parts of the air of the room absorb radiated heat, what is saturated at a higher temperature, being nearer to the fire, rises to the ceiling, spreads outwards along the ceiling, and has its place supplied by the air, which is thus pushed towards the fire from the places which are not directly illuminated.\n\nFar different is the method of warming the room by a stove. Here the radiation, if any, is very feeble or scanty; and if a passage were allowed up the chimney for the warmed air, it would be quickly carried off. This is well known to the English who reside in the cold climates of St Petersburg, Archangel, &c. They love the exhilarating flutter of an open fire, and often have one in their parlour; but this, so far from warming the room during the extreme cold weather, obliges them to heat their stoves more frequently, and even abstracts the heat from a whole suite of apartments. But all passage this way is shut up when we warm a room by stoves. The air immediately contiguous to the stove is heated by contact, and this heat is gradually, though slowly, diffused through the whole room. The diffusion would however be very slow indeed, were it not for the great expansibility of air by heat. But the air surrounding the stove quickly expands and rises to the ceiling, while the neighbouring air slides in to supply the place, nay is even pushed in by the air which goes outwards aloft. Thus the whole air is soon mixed, and the room acquires almost an equal temperature throughout.\nThe warming by stoves must therefore be managed upon very different principles from those adopted in the employment of open fires. The general principle is, 1st, To employ the fuel in the most effectual manner for heating the external part of the stove, which is immediately efficient in warming the contiguous air; and, 2nd, To keep in the room the air already warmed, at least as much as is consistent with wholesomeness and cleanliness.\n\nThe first purpose is accomplished by conducting the fire of the furnace round its external parts, or, in short, by making every part of the flue external. Of all forms, that of a long pipe, returned backwards and forwards, up and down (provided only that the place of its last discharge be considerably higher than its entry from the fire-place), would be the most effectual. We have seen a very small stove constructed in this way, the whole being inclosed in a handsome case of polished iron plate, pierced and cut into elegant foliage like the cock of a watch, so that the odd looking pipes were completely concealed. Though only three feet long, one foot thick, and five feet high, it warmed a very lofty room of 24 feet by 18, and consumed less than half the fuel of a stove of the more usual make, which did not so fully warm a smaller chamber.\n\nIt would occupy a volume to describe the immense variety of stoves which ingenuity or architectural taste has constructed. We shall content ourselves with giving a specimen of the two chief classes into which they may be distinguished.\n\nThe air of a room may be equally warmed, either by applying it to the surface of a small stove made very hot, or to the surface of a much larger stove more moderately heated. The first kind is chiefly used in Holland, Flanders, and the milder climates of Germany and Poland. The last are universally used in the frozen climates of Russia and Sweden. The first are generally made of cast-iron, and the last of brick-work covered with glazed tiles or flueco.\n\nFig. 1 represents a small German stove fully sufficient for warming a room of 24 feet by 18. The base is about three feet broad and 14 inches deep, that is, from back to front, and six or seven feet high. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> is in the fashion of that country; but the operative structure of it will admit of any style of ornament. A, is the fire-place, and the wood or charred coal is laid on the bottom, which has no bars. Bars would admit the air too freely among the fuel, and would both confine it too fast and raise too great a heat. That no heat may be uselessly expended, the sole of the fire-place and the whole bottom of the stove is raised an inch or two above the floor of the room, and the air is therefore warmed by it in succession, and rises upwards. For the same reason the back of the stove is not in contact with the wall of the room, or of the niche in which it is placed. The fire-place is shut up by a door which fits closely to its case, and has a small wicket at the bottom, whose aperture is regulated by a sliding plate, so as to admit no more air than what suffices for slowly consuming the fuel. The flame and heated air rise to the top of the fire-place three or four inches above the arch or mantle-piece, and get out laterally by two narrow passages B, B, immediately below the top-plate of the base. The current bends downward on each side, passes at C, C, under the partition plates which divide the two side chambers, and then rises upwards through the outer division of each, and passes through narrow slits D, D, in the top plate, and from thence along the two hollow piers E, E. The two lateral currents unite at the top of the arch, and go through the single passage F into the larger hollow behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESCUTCHEON\">escutcheon</a> G. From this place it either goes straight upwards into the vent in the wall by a pipe on the top of the stove, or it goes into the wall behind by a pipe inserted in the back of the stove. The propriety of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> is very obvious. The current of hot air is applied to exterior parts of the stove everywhere except in the two side chambers of the base, where the partition-plates form one side of the canal. Even this might be avoided by making each of these side-chambers a detached hollow pillar. But this would greatly increase the trouble of construction and joining together, and is by no means necessary. The arch H has a graceful appearance, and affords a very warm situation for any thing that requires it, such as a drink in a sick person's bed-chamber, &c. Perches of a certain class use this place for keeping a dish warm; nay, the lower part of the arch is frequently occupied by an inclosed chamber, where the heat rises high enough even for dressing victuals, as will be easily imagined when we reflect that the sole of it is the roof of the fire-place.\n\nThe stove now described is supplied with fuel and with air by the front door opening into the room. That there may be room for fuel, this middle part projects a few inches before the two side-chambers. These last, with the whole upper part of the stove, are not more than ten inches deep. The passages, therefore, from the fire-place are towards the back of it; so that if we have a mind to see the fire (which is always cheerful), the door may be thrown open, and there is no danger of the smoke coming out after the current has once warmed the upper part of the stove. When the stove is of such dimensions that the base is about two feet and a half or three feet high, the fire-place may be furnished with a small grate in the British style. If the door is so hung that it can not only be thrown back, but lifted off its hinges, we have a stove grate of the completest kind, fully adequate, in our mild climate, to warm a handsome apartment, even with an open fire; and when we hang on the door, and shut up the fire-place, a stove of the dimensions already given is almost too much for a large drawing-room.\n\nWe have frequently remarked, that one side of these stoves grows much warmer than the other, and that it was difficult to prevent or remedy this; and we imagine that this is an unavoidable defect in all stoves with a double flue. It is scarcely possible to make the fire so equable in the fire-place, that one side shall not be a little warmer than the other, and a brisker current will then be produced in it. This must increase the consumption of the fuel on this side, which will increase the current, will heat this side still more, and thus go on continually till the fuel on this side is expended; after which the other side will obtain and increase the superiority. The flue is made double, that the fire-place may occupy the middle of the front; and it will be difficult to gain this point of symmetry with one flue. The inconvenience may, however, be corrected by damping valves placed in some part of the upright funnels E, E.\nIn the colder winters on the continent, it is thought necessary to increase the effect by making the fire-place open to the back of the stove. Its mouth or door communicates with or is joined to an opening of the same dimensions formed in the wall, and the door is on the other side in an antechamber or lobby. In Westphalia, and other places of Germany, the apartments are disposed round a spacious lobby, into which all their fire-places open, and are there supplied with fuel. By this construction it is plain that the air of the room, already warmed by the stove, is not carried off, and the room is more heated. But this method is very unfavourable to cheerfulness and health. The same air, confined, and repeatedly breathed and compounded with all the volatile emanations of the room, quickly loses that refreshing quality that is so desirable, and even so necessary for health. It is never renewed except by very partial admixtures when the room doors are thrown open, and becomes disagreeable to any person coming in from the open air; and in the houses of the less opulent becomes really offensive and nauseous.\n\nSomething of this is unavoidable in all rooms heated by stoves. Even in our apartments in this island, persons of delicate nerves are hurt by what they call the close air of a room; and it is long before the smell of dinner is quite removed from a dining-room, notwithstanding the copious current up the chimney. This must be incomparably more sensible in a room heated by a stove; and this inconvenience is peculiarly sensible with respect to the stove which we are considering at present, where we employ a small surface heated to a great degree.\n\nSuch stoves are seldom made of anything else than cast-iron. This (in those parts at least which are in immediate contact with the fuel) is in a state of continual calcination, and even throwing off scales. This indeed is not seen, because it is the bottom or sole of the fire-place which is so heated; but the effect on the air of the room is the same. The calcination of the iron is occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of pure vital air with the iron. This is abstracted from the general mass of atmospheric air in the room, of which it usually constitutes about two-fifths. By this abstraction the remainder becomes less fit for supporting animal life or flame, and may even become highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DELETERIOUS\">deleterious</a>. In every degree the remainder becomes less refreshing, and grows dull and oppressive. This is always accompanied by a peculiar smell, which, though not disgusting, is unpleasant. It resembles the smell of burnt feathers, or more exactly the smell we feel if we rub violently for some time the palms of our hands together when perfectly dry.\n\nFor similar reasons these iron stoves occasion a sickly smell, by burning every particle of dust which falls on the hot parts; and if they be wiped with a woollen cloth, or any cloth not perfectly free from every kind of greasy or oily matter, a smell is produced for a day or days afterwards; so that without the most scrupulous attention we suffer by our very cleanliness.\n\nFor such reasons we think that the stoves of brick-work covered with stucco or with glazed tiles are vastly preferable. These are much used in the gentler houses in Flanders and Holland, where they are made in the most elegant forms, and decorated with beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> or enamel; but it is plain that they cannot be so effectual, nor equally warm a room with the same expense of fuel. Earthen ware, especially when covered with porous stucco, is far inferior to metal in its power of conducting heat. If built of bricks, they must be vastly more bulky when the fire-place and flues are of the same dimensions. The most perfect way of constructing them would certainly be to make them of pottery, in parts exactly fitted to each other, and joined by a proper cement. This mode of constructing would admit of every elegance of form or richness of ornament, and would not be so bulky as those which are built of bricks. The great difficulty is to prevent their cracking by the heat. Different parts of the stove being of very different heats, they expand unequally, and there is no cement which can withstand this, especially when we recollect that the same heat which expands the baked earth causes the clay or cement, with which the parts of the stove are put together or covered, to contract. Accordingly those earthen ware stoves seldom stand a winter or two without cracking in some place or other, even when strengthened by iron hoops and cramps judiciously disposed within them. Even hooping them them externally, which would be very unsightly, will not prevent this; for nothing can resist the expansion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> by heat and cold. When a crack happens in a stove, it is not only unsightly, but highly dangerous; because it may be so situated, that it will discharge into the room the air vitiated by the fire.\n\nFor these and other reasons, we can scarcely hope to make stoves of brick-work or pottery which shall bear the necessary heat without cracking; and their use must therefore be confined to cases where very moderate heat is sufficient. We need not describe their construction. It is evident that it should be more simple than that of iron stoves; and we imagine that in the very few cases in which they are likely to be employed in this country, a single fire-place and an arch over it, divided, if we please, by a partition or two of thin tile to lengthen the flue, will be quite enough. If the stove is made in whole or in part of potters ware, a base for the fireplace, with an urn, column, obelisk, or pyramid above it, for increasing the surface, will also be sufficient. The failure commonly happens at the joinings, where the different pieces of a different heat, and perhaps of a different baking, are apt to expand unequally, and by working on each other one of them must give way. Therefore, instead of making the joints close and using any cement, the upper piece should stand in a groove formed in the undermost, having a little powdered chalk or clay sprinkled over it, which will effectually prevent the passage of any air; and room being thus given for the unequal expansion, the joint remains entire. This may be considered as a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> for all furnace-work, where it is in vain to attempt to hinder the mutual working of the parts.\n\nWe have seen stoves in small apartments at St Petersburg, which were made internally of potters ware, in a great variety of forms, and then covered with a thick coat of stucco, finished externally with the utmost elegance of ornament, and we were informed that they were very rarely subject to crack. They did not give much heat, on account of the very low conducting power of the porous stucco; but we imagine that they would be abundantly warm for a moderate room in this country.\nWhen fitted up in these situations, and with these precautions, the brick or pottery stoves are incomparably more sweet and pleasant than the iron ones.\n\nBut in the intense colds of Russia and Sweden, or even for very large rooms in this kingdom, stoves of these small dimensions are not sufficiently powerful, and we must follow the practice of those countries where they are made of great size, and very moderately heated. It is needless to describe their external form, which may be varied at pleasure. Their internal structure is the same in all, and is distinctly described in PNEUMATICS, No. 364. We shall only enlarge a little on the peculiarities connected with the general principle of their construction.\n\nThe stove is intended as a sort of magazine, in which a great quantity of heat may be quickly accumulated, to be afterwards slowly communicated to the air of the room. The stove is therefore built extremely massive; and it is found that they are more powerful when coated with clay as wet as can be made to hang together. We imagine the reason of this to be, that very wet clay, and more particularly flucco, must be exceedingly porous when dry, and therefore a very slow conductor of heat. Instead of sticking on the glazed tiles with no more clay or flucco than is sufficient to attach them, each tile has at its back a sort of box baked in one piece about two or three inches deep. It is represented in Fig. 2. This is filled with mortar, and then stuck on the brick-work of the stove, which has a great number of iron pins or hooks driven into the joints, which may sink into this clay and keep it firmly attached when dry. This coating, with the massive brick-work, forms a great mass of matter to be heated by the fuel. The lowest chamber, which is the fire-place, is somewhat wider, and considerably thicker than the stories above, which are merely flues. When the fire-place is finished and about to be arched over, a flat iron bar of small thickness is laid along the top of the side-wall on both sides, a set of finishing bricks being moulded on purpose with a notch to receive the iron bar. Cross bars are laid over these, one at each end and one or two between, having a bit turned down at the ends, which takes hold of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> bars, and keeps them from being thrust outwards either by the pressure of the arch or by the swelling in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the heat. In Fig. 3, A is the cross section of one of the long bars, and BC is part of one of the cross bars, and CD is the clench which confines the bar A. This precaution is chiefly necessary, because the contraction of the stove upwards obliges the walls of the other stories to bear a little on the arch of the fire-place. The building above is kept together in like manner by other courses of iron bars at every second return of the flue. The top of the stove is finished by a pretty thick covering of brick-work. The last passage for the air at H (see PNEUMATICS, Fig. 62.) has a ring lining its upper extremity, and projecting an inch or two above it. The flat round it is covered with lead. When we would stop this passage, a covered shape like a basin or cover for dishes at table is whelmed over it. The rim of this, resting on the lead, effectually prevents all air from coming through and getting up the vent. Access is had to this damper by a door which can be shut tight enough to prevent the heated air of the room from wafting itself up the vent. When the room is too warm, it may be very rapidly cooled by opening this door. The warm air rushes up with great rapidity, and is replaced by cool air from without.\n\nThe management of the stove is as follows. About eight o'clock in the morning the pietchnick, or servant who has the charge of the stoves, takes off the cover, shuts the damper-door, and opens the fire-place door. He then puts in a handful of wood shavings or straw, and kindles it. This warms the stove and vent, and begins a current of air through it. He then lays a few chips on the sole of the fire-place, immediately within the door; and behind this he arranges the billets of birchwood, with their ends inwards. Then he lays on more wood in the front, till he thinks there is enough. He sets fire to the chips, shuts the door, and opens the small wicket at its bottom. The air blows the flame of the chips upon the billets behind them, and thus kindles them. They consume slowly, while the billets in front remain untouched by the fire. The servant, having made his first round of the rooms, returns to this stove, and opens the door above to admit air into the vent. This is to supply its draught, and thus to check the draught in the body of the stove, which is generally too strong at this time, and would consume the fuel too fast. By this time the billets in the front are burning, first at the bottom, and the rest in succession as they sink down on the embers and come opposite to the wicket. The room does not yet feel any effect from the fire, the heat of which has not yet reached its external surface; but in about half an hour this grows warm. The upper door is shut again, that no heat may now be wasted. The pietchnick by and by spreads the embers and ashes over the whole bottom of the fire-place with a rake, by which the bottom is greatly heated, and heats the air contiguous to it externally (for it stands on little pillars) very powerfully. He takes care to bring up to the top of the ashes every bit of wood or coal that is not yet consumed, that all may be completely expended. He does this as briskly as possible, that the room may not lose much warmed air by keeping open the fire-place door. At his last visit, when he observes no more glowing embers, he shuts the fire-place door and wicket, and puts the damper on the passage above, and shuts its door.\u2014All this is over in about an hour and a half after kindling the fire. All current of air is now at an end within the stove, and it is now a great mass of brick-work, heated to a great degree within, but only about blood-warm externally. The heat gradually spreads outwards, and the external surface of the stove acquires its greatest heat about three o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>; after which it gradually cools till next morning.\n\nThis heat seldom is so great that one cannot bear to touch the stove with his cheek, and to keep it there. In consequence of this it can burn none of the dust which unavoidably falls on the stove, and we are never troubled with the sickening smells that are unavoidable when we employ the small cast-iron stoves much heated. The great expense of heat in a room arises from the glass windows. The pane is so thin that the external air keeps it continually cold, and thus the windows are continually robbing the air of the room of its heat. This expense of heat is reduced to less than one-third by double casements. The inner casement is about as much colder than the room as the outer casement is warmer.\nwarmer than the air of the fields; and we have the singular advantage of having no ice formed on the glaases. But to ensure this last advantage, the seams of the inner casement must be pasted with paper, and those of the outer casement must be left ungasketed. If we do the contrary, we shall certainly have ice on the outer casement; the reason of which is easily seen.\n\nWe have been thus particular in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the management, because the reasons of some particulars are not very obvious, and the practice would not readily occur to us in this country; so that a person who, on the faith of our recommendation, should prefer one of these stoves to the German stove, whose management is simple and obvious, might be greatly disappointed. But by following this method, we are confident that the Russian stove will be found much superior both in warmth and agreeable air. The spreading out of the embers, and waiting till all is reduced to ashes before the doors are shut, is also absolutely necessary, and a neglect of it would expose us to imminent danger of suffocation by fixed air; and this is the only inconvenience of the Russian stove, from which the other stove is free. The fixed air has no smell; and the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of its presence is a slight giddiness and lassitude, which disposes us to sit down and to sleep. This would be fatal; and we must immediately open the upper passage and the fireplace door, so as to produce a strong current to carry the vitiated air of the room up the chimney. Throwing up the sashes, or at least opening all the doors, is proper on such an occasion.\n\nIf we burn pit-coal, either raw or charred, this precaution is still more necessary; because the cinder is not so easily or so soon completely consumed. This fuel will require a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the management from wood fuel, but which is easily seen by any person of reflection. The safe way would be to rake out all half-burnt coal before shutting up the doors.\n\nIf we use raw pit-coal, great care is necessary to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of heat in the upper part of the stove. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> place for the chimney-sweep; and if we attempt to burn it out, we run a great risk of splitting that part of the stove which is the most slightly constructed. It is advisable therefore to burn it away every day, by giving a brisk draught with an open door for five minutes. With wood or coak there is no danger.\n\nIt will not be improper in this place to give some instructions for the construction of stoves for warming several floors in a great manufactory, such as a cotton-mill, or a public library or museum.\n\nIn such situations we think cleanliness, wholesomeness, and sweetness of air, no less necessary than in the drawing-room of a man of opulence. We therefore recommend the brick-stove in preference to the iron one; and though it would not be the best or most economical practice to heat it but once a-day, and we should rather prefer the German practice of constant feeding, we still think it highly proper to limit the heat to a very moderate degree, and employ a large surface.\n\nIf the disposition of the rooms allows us the convenience of a thick party-wall, we would place the stove in the middle of this wall, in an arch which pierces through the wall. Immediately above this arch we would carry up a very wide chimney through the whole height. This chimney must have a passage opening into each floor on both sides, which may be very accurately shut up by a door. The stove being set up under the arch, it must have a pipe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with its flue, and rising up through this chimney. Could an earthen pipe be properly supported, and secured from splitting by hoops, we should prefer it for the reasons already given. But as this is perhaps expecting too much, we must admit the use of a cast-iron pipe. This is the real chimney or flue of the stove, and must be of as great diameter as possible, that it may act, by an extensive surface, all the way up.\n\nThe stove stands under the arch in the wall; but the air that is warmed by its surface would escape on both sides, and would be expended in that single floor. To prevent this, the stove must be inclosed in a cage; this may be of brick-work, at the distance of two or three inches from the stove all round. It must be well shut in above, and at the foundation must have a row of small holes to admit the air all around it. This air will then be warmed over the whole space between the stove and the cage, past up the chimney, and there receive additional heat from the flue-pipe which is in the middle. Great care must be taken that the fire-place door have no communication with the space between the stove and its cage, but be inclosed in a mouth-piece which comes through the cage, and opens into the feeding-room. Thus all the air which goes up to the rooms will be pure and wholesome, provided we take care that everything be kept clean and sweet about the air-holes below. Observe that those air-holes which are near the furnace door must be inclosed in a wooden trunk which takes in its air at some distance from this door; for since the current between the stove and cage may be almost as great as the current within the stove (nay, when a puff of wind beats down the chimney, it may even exceed it), there is a risk of some vitiated air and smoke being drawn into the cage.\n\nIf the stove cannot be placed in the arch of a party-wall, it may be set adjoining to a side or outer wall, and furnished with a cage, a large chimney, and a flue-pipe, in the same manner. But in this case a great deal of heat is wasted on this outer wall, and carried off by the external air. In this situation we would recommend to line that part of the wall which is behind the stove (at two or three inches distance), and the whole of the chimney, with plaster on laths. These should be nailed on battens properly fastened on the wall, leaving a space of an inch between the laths and the wall. The plaster should be of the most spungy kind, having in it a quantity of clay in powder instead of the full proportion of sand. Horse-dung, washed with water and strained through coarse flannel, leaves a great portion of unaffiliated vegetable fibre, which will mix very intimately in the plaster, and make it a substance very unfit for conducting heat. There is no danger of catching fire by this lining. We have seen a most tremendous fire rage for three hours, in contact with a partition of lath and plaster (on the plaster-side however), without discolouring the thin laths on the other side. We once saw a cottage chimney on fire, and burn till the foot was consumed. This chimney was nothing but a pipe of a foot wide, made of laths, and plastered on the inside and outside; and it passed through a thatched roof. We therefore recommend this in place of the brick-cage for inclosing the stove. It would save heat; and as it might\nbe made in pieces on detached frames, which could be joined by iron straps and hinges, any part of the stove could be laid open for repairs at pleasure.\n\nWe have no hesitation in saying that a stove constructed in this manner would be greatly superior in power to any we have seen, and would be free from many of their disgusting defects. We beg leave therefore to introduce here the description of one which was to have been erected in one of the churches of the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>.\n\nFig. 4. is a sketch of the plan of the church contained in the parallelogram AFED. P marks the place of the pulpit, and LMNO the front of the galleries. These are carried back to the side-walls AB and DC. But at the end opposite to the pulpit they do not reach so far, but leave a space BFEC about 12 feet wide. Below the back of the galleries, on each side, there is a passage ABGH, KICD, separated from the heated part of the church by partitions which reach from the floor to the galleries, so that the space HGIK is completely shut in. The church is an ancient Gothic building, of a light and airy structure, having two rows of large windows above the arcades, and a spacious window in the east end above the pulpit. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> complain of a cold air, which they feel pouring down upon their heads. This is more particularly felt by those sitting in the fronts of the galleries. We imagine that this arises chiefly from the extensive surface of the upper row of windows, and of the cold stone-walls above, which rob the air of its heat as it glides up along the sides of the church. It becomes heavier by collapsing, and in this state defends in the middle of the church.\n\nThe stove S is placed against the middle of the west wall at the distance of a few inches, and is completely inclosed in a case of lath and plaster. The vent, which is to carry off the smoke and burnt air, is conveyed up or along the wall, and through the roof or side-wall, but without any communication with the case. In like manner the fire-place door is open to the passage, without communicating with the case; and care is taken that the holes which admit the air into the case are so disposed that they shall run no risk of drawing in any air from the fire-place door.\n\nFrom the top of this case proceed two trunks Q, R, each of which is two feet broad and six inches deep, coated within and without with the most flouncy plaster that can be composed. For this purpose we should recommend a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of powdered charcoal and as much clay and quicklime as will give it a very slight cohesion. We know that a piece of this may be held in the hand, without inconvenience, within an inch of where it is of a glowing red heat.\u2014These trunks open into another trunk XVTYZ, which ranges along the partition immediately under the galleries, and may be formed externally into a corniche, a little massive indeed, but not unsightly in a building of this style. This trunk is coated in the same manner. It has several openings a, a, &c., which have sliders that can be drawn aside by means of handles accessible from the outer passage.\u2014At the extremities X and Z of this trunk are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> trunks which come up through the galleries, and are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to a considerable height. At their junction with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> trunk are two doors large enough to admit a lamp. Each perpendicular trunk has also a valve by which it can be completely flopped.\n\nThe stove is managed as follows: Early in the morning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERINTENDENT\">superintendent</a> shuts all the sliders, and sets a lamp (burning) in each of the trunks X and Z, and shuts the doors. He then puts on and kindles the fire in the stove, and manages it either in the Russian or German method. Perhaps the latter is preferable, as being liable to fewer accidents from mistake or neglect.\n\nThe lamps set in the lower ends of the upright trunks presently warm them, and produce a current of air upwards. This must be supplied by the horizontal trunk, which must take it from the case round the stove. Thus a current is begun in the direction we wish. By and by the air in the case acquires heat from the stove, and the current becomes extremely brisk. When the manager perceives this, he removes the lamps, shuts the valves, and opens the holes a, a, &c., beginning with the most remote, and proceeding slowly towards the stove from each extremity of the horizontal branches. The heated air now issues by these holes, glides along the ceiling below the galleries, and escapes, by rising up along the fronts of the galleries, and will be sensibly felt by those sitting there, coming on their faces with a gentle warmth. It will then rise (in great part) straight up, while some of it will glide backwards, to the comfort of those who sit behind.\n\nThe propriety of shutting the valves of the upright trunks is evident. If they were left open, no air would come out by the holes a, a, &c.; but, on the contrary, the air would go in at these holes to supply the current, and the stove be rendered useless. The air delivered by these holes will keep close to the ceiling, and will not, as we imagine, inconvenience those who sit below the galleries. But if it should be found to render these parts too warm, holes may be pierced through the ceiling, by which it will rise among the people above, and must be very comfortable. It will require the careful attention of some intelligent person to bring all this into a proper train at first, by finding the proper apertures of the different holes, so as to render the heat equable through the whole space. But this being once ascertained the difficulty is over.\n\nThe air trunks must be very capacious, but may be contracted towards the extremities as their lateral discharges diminish; and the row of holes which admit the air to the case round the stove must be fully able to supply them.\n\nIt must be observed, that in this construction the ascensional force is but small. It is only the height of a short column of warm air from the ground to the galleries. At first indeed it is great, having the unlimited height of the perpendicular trunks at X and Z; but during the use of the stove it is reduced to nine or ten feet. It is necessary, therefore, that the stove be highly heated, perhaps considerably beyond the Russian practice, but yet inferior to the heat of the German iron stoves. But still we strongly recommend the brick or pottery stoves, on account of the wholesome sweetness of the air which they furnish; and we are certain that a stove of moderate dimensions, eight feet long, for instance, by eight feet high, will be sufficient for warming a church holding 1200 or 1500 people. If the stove could be placed lower, which in many situations is very practicable, its effect would be proportionally greater, because all depends on the rapidity of the current. When we are limited in height, we must extend the\nstove so much the more in length, and make the air trunks more capacious. These and many other circumstances of local modification must be attended to by the erecter of the stove; and without the judicious attention of an intelligent artist, we may expect nothing but disappointment. It is hardly possible to give instructions suited to every situation; but a careful attention to the general principle which determines the accidental force will free the artist from any great risk of failure.\n\nWe may say the same thing of stoves for conservatories, hot-houses, hot walls, &c., and can hardly add anything of consequence to what we have already said on these heads in the article PNEUMATICS.\n\nWe must not, however, dismiss the subject without taking notice of the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> projects which have been frequently offered for drying malt by stoves. Many of these are to be seen in the publications of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">Academies</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, Upsal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>; and some have been erected in this kingdom, but they have not been found to answer.\n\nWe apprehend that they cannot answer. To dry malt, and make it fit for the ales and beers for which this island is so famous, it is by no means enough that we give it a proper and an equable supply of heat.\u2014This alone would bake it and make it flinty, causing the moisture to penetrate the mealy particles of the grain; and, by completely dissolving the soluble parts, would render each kernel an uniform mass, which would dry into a flinty grain, breaking like a piece of glass.\u2014A grain of malt is not an inert pulp. It is a seed, in an active state, growing, and of an organized structure. We wish to stop it in this state, and kill it, not by heating it, but by abstracting its moisture. We thus leave it in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> or organized form, springy, and fit for imbibing water in the mash tub, without running into a paste.\n\nTo accomplish these purposes, the construction of our malt kilns seems very well adapted. The kiln is the only flue of the furnace, and a copious current of air is formed through among the grains, carrying off with it the water which is evaporating by the heat. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, being chiefly in consequence of the vapour being immediately dissolved by the passing air, will stop as soon as the current of air stops. This current has to make its way through moist grain, laid in a pretty thick bed, and matted together. Some force, therefore, is necessary to drive it through. This is furnished by the draught of the kiln. Substituting a stove, immediately applied to the malt, will not have this effect. The only way in which we think this can be done different from the present, is to have a horizontal flue, as has been proposed in these projects, spread out at a small distance below the grate on which the malt is laid, and to cover the whole with a high dome, like a glass-house dome. This being filled with a tall column of hot air, and having no passage into it but through the malt, would produce the current which we want. We are convinced that this will make much less fuel serve; but we are by no means certain that the sulphurous and carbonic acid which accompanies the air in our common kiln is not a necessary or a useful ingredient in the process. It is well known that different coals, cinders, or charcoal, impart different qualities to the malts, and are preferred each for its own purpose.\n\nA stove constructed on similar principles, but composed of very different materials, has been lately erected in several of the churches in Edinburgh. This stove, which is formed entirely of cast iron, may be considered as a double stove, an outer case, and a furnace or inner stove. The fuel is burnt in the inner stove; and the smoke produced during the process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, is carried off by a chimney, which passes through the top of the outer stove, and is conveyed to the outside of the building. The outer case includes not only the furnace or inner stove, but also a considerable space, occupied by the air of the atmosphere, which is freely admitted through a number of openings placed around it; and when any current of air is produced, it passes off from the space between the outer case and inner stove, and is conveyed by tubes through the body of the apartment. But we shall first describe the different parts of which the stove is composed, after which we shall be better able to understand its mode of operation.\n\nFig. 5. exhibits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of this stove. AB is the body, which is about three feet high, and of a circular form. BC is a square pedestal on which the stove is placed, and which contains the ash pit DD. The height of the pedestal is about a foot, and it is nearly insulated by resting on the spherical supports aa, also of cast iron. EEE are openings in front of the ash pit through which the air enters to support the combustion. These openings can be enlarged or diminished, or opened and shut at pleasure. FF is the door of the furnace through which the fuel is introduced. This door is attached to the inner furnace, and is double. It is one foot broad, and 11 inches high. GG is the chimney, which passes from the furnace within, through the outer case, and conveys the smoke out of the building. HH are openings in the outer case, and are eight in number, through which the air enters, and being heated, is greatly rarified, and passes off through the funnel or pipe IIII. This pipe communicates only with the outer stove, and being shut at the end K, the air rushes out from the small tubes LL, inserted into the side of the pipe IIII, and thus mixes with the cold air of the church. The diameter of the outer case at the bottom is about two feet, and the diameter of the furnace within is about 16 inches.\n\nFig. 6. is a section of the stove. AB is the outer case, from which passes off the pipe or funnel CCC, by which the heated air is conveyed through the church. DD is the furnace in the inside, in which the fuel is burnt, and EEE is the chimney or funnel which conveys the smoke from the inner furnace out of the building. It passes through the outer stove AB at F.\n\nFig. 7. is a plan of this stove. AB is the pedestal on which it rests, and which contains the ash pit. CC is the outer case, and DD is the furnace within, in which are seen the transverse bars which support the fuel.\n\nThe length of the body of the church, in which two stoves of the form and dimensions now described are erected, is about 60 feet, and the breadth is about 45 feet. The tubes IIII are conveyed along the lower edge of the gallery, about half the length of the church. The fires are lighted up about four or five o'clock on the Sunday morning, during the earlier part of the cold season; but as the season advances, it is usual to light them up the night before. From this time till the congregation assemble for the afternoon service, the furnaces are\nare kept constantly supplied with fuel. By this management the air in the church is kept comfortably warm during the coldest season of the year.\n\nThese stoves, it appears to us, are susceptible of some improvement, both in their construction and in the places in which they are erected. With regard to the first circumstance, an external coating of plaster work, or of the same kind of materials as are used for coating the inside of chemical furnaces, would be of some use in preventing an unnecessary waste of heat, as well as the disagreeable smell which is sometimes complained of, and which is supposed to arise from the combustion of light bodies floating in the air and drawn by the current to the heated metal; and with regard to the last, viz., the places in which they are erected, it is perfectly obvious that they ought to be as completely insulated as possible, and particularly ought not to communicate with any body which is a good conductor of heat. Some of the stoves erected in the churches of Edinburgh, which we have examined, are faulty in this respect. One in particular is placed in close contact with a gable wall.\n\nThe quantity of coals consumed in two of these stoves in one of the churches of Edinburgh during the course of a season, we have been informed, amounts to about five carts of 12 cwt. each; so that at the Edinburgh prices of coal, the expense for fuel for heating one of the churches is about 50 shillings. This being added to the expenses of attendance, includes the whole expenditure, besides some occasional repairs which are required in heating a church of the above dimensions.\n\nThe following is the description of an improved stove by Mr Field of Newman Street London, in which, it is stated by the author, the various advantages of heating, boiling, steaming, evaporating, drying, ventilating, &c., are united; some of which we shall detail in his own words.\n\n\"Fig. 8 represents a longitudinal section of the stove, showing the course of the air from its entrance into the flues of the stove at A, to its entrance into the upper chamber of the stove at B; and also the course of the smoke from the fire-place at C, till it escapes from the stove at D. E, E, are the doors or openings of the fire-place and ash-hole.\n\n\"Fig. 9. is a similar section at right angles with the above, exhibiting the course of the air through the chambers of the stove, from its entrance into the chamber No. 1, at B to its entrance beneath the fire-place at F. This figure also shows sections of the flues, with the divisions through which the air and smoke pass separately, the smoke-flue in the centre, and the air-flues on each side. G, G, are doors and openings through which the articles to be dried are introduced into the chambers.\n\n\"When the fire is lighted, and the doors of the chambers, ash hole, and fire-place, closed, the air by which the fire is supplied enters at A, fig. 8, passes through the air-flues a, a, a, enters the upper chamber at B, traverses and descends through the chambers No. 1, 2, 3, and arrives beneath the fire at F, fig. 9. Having supplied the fire with oxygen, it passes through the flue with the smoke, and escapes at D, heating in its protracted course the chambers and air-flues.\n\n\"As the cold air enters the stove at A, immediately above a plate forming the top of the fire-place, and pursues a similar route with the fire-flue, it enters the chambers very much heated and rarefied. Hence any moist substance placed in the chambers evaporates in consequence, not only of the heated flues circulating round them, but of a stream of warm rarefied air, which, while it continually raises evaporation, as continually bears away the exhaled moisture in its passage to the fire, thus imitating the gradual and efficacious plan of nature in drying by the sun and air. While these effects are taking place within the stove, part of the air which enters at A, fig. 8, and 9, passes through air-flues on the other side of the fire-flue, pursues a parallel course with the first, and gives out a current of warm air to the room at an aperture H. This effect may be obtained in a much higher degree, if the doors of the chambers and ash-hole are opened: should the hand or face be then brought near, they would be fanned with a stream of warm air, especially from the upper chamber.\n\n\"By means of this stove I have evaporated milk to dryness, without burning or discolouring it; and have dried cherries, plums, and other fruits, so as to imitate those which are received from abroad. I have repeatedly dried colours and the most delicate substances without the slightest injury, even though the operation proceeded quickly.\n\n\"The height of the stove is about five feet and a half; its diameter two feet and a half, and that of the flues four inches. The external part is constructed of brick, and the internal parts of thin Rye gate or fire-stone, except the top of the fire-place, which is a plate of cast iron. Were it to be wholly formed of iron, its effects would necessarily be more powerful.\n\n\"Fig. 10. represents an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the plan, in which stoves of this kind may be advantageously connected with one or more furnaces for chemical or other uses. The fire-place, brought out, either in front or on one side, by the present positions of its crown 1, forms a reverberatory furnace, or will make a sand-bath by reverberating it.\n\n\"The space occupied by the fire-place in fig. 8, may in this be converted into apartments for evaporating substances, or occasionally for cooling them by an opening at K to admit cold air, while the warm air of the stove is excluded by a register or door. The dotted lines show the manner in which a second furnace may be connected by an opening into the flue at L.\n\n\"In addition to the uses already pointed out, this stove would probably be found extremely serviceable in drying japanners' goods, and containing the noxious fumes and gas which arise from the oil and varnish used in this business.\n\n\"Since the stove is not limited to any certain dimensions, it might be adapted to the drying of malt and hops, perhaps of herbs, corn, and seeds generally. It might also be accommodated to the purposes of the sugar-bakers, connected with the great fires they employ for their boilers. It has been shown to be useful in the confectioners' art, and probably it may be equally so in baking biscuits for the navy; nor less so in drying linen for the laundress, dyer, calico-printer, and bleacher. I have myself found it well accommodated for a chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>.\"","sp":362,"ep":372},{"h":"STOURBRIDGE","t":"or STURBRIDGE, the name of a field near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, noted for its famous fair kept annually on the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, and which continues for a fortnight.

Of the early part of his life we know very little, except that he was bred to his father's business, which in the year 1560 he relinquished, devoting himself entirely to the study of our ancient historians, chronicles, annals, charters, registers, and records. Of these he made a considerable collection, travelling for that purpose to different parts of the kingdom, and transcribing such manuscripts as he could not purchase. But this profession of an antiquary being attended with no present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>, he was obliged for subsistence to return to his trade.\u2014It happened, however, that his talents and necessities were made known to Dr Parker <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>; who being himself an antiquary, encouraged and enabled Mr Stow to prosecute his darling study. In those times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> was then upon the throne, honest John Stow did not escape danger. His collection of Popish records was deemed cause of suspicion. His younger brother Thomas preferred no less than 140 articles against him before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>; but the proof being insufficient, he was acquitted. In 1565 he first published his Summary of the Chronicles of England. About the year 1581 he began his Survey of London. In 1583 he was one of the two collectors for a great mutter of Limehouse ward: in the same year he petitioned the corporation of London to befallow on him the benefit of two freemen, to enable him to publish his survey; and in 1589 he petitioned again for a pension. Whether he succeeded, is not known. He was principally concerned in the second edition of Holinshed's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a>, published in 1587. He also corrected, and twice augmented, Chaucer's works, published in 1561 and in 1597. His survey of London was first published in 1598. To these laborious works he would have added his large Chronicle, or History of England; but he lived only to publish an abstract of it, under the title of Flores Historiarum. The folio volume, which was printed after his death, with the title of Stow's Chronicle, was taken from his papers by Edmund Howes. Having thus spent his life and fortune in these laborious pursuits, he was at last obliged to solicit the charitable and well disposed for relief. For this purpose, King James I granted him, in 1603, a brief, which was renewed in 1604, authorizing him to collect in churches the benefactions of his fellow-citizens. He died in April 1605, aged 80; and was buried in his parish church of St Andrew's, Underhaft, where his widow erected a decent monument to his memory.

He contracted a strict friendship with Cornelius Gallus, governor of Egypt, and travelled into several countries to observe the situation of places, and the customs of nations. He flourished under Augustus, and died under Tiberius about the year 23, in a very advanced age.\u2014He composed several works, all of which are lost except his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a> in 17 books; which are justly esteemed very precious remains of antiquity.

To this edition is subjoined the Chremomathie, or epitome of Strabo; which according to Mr Dodwell, who has written a very elaborate and learned dissertation about it, was made by some unknown person between the years of Christ 676 and 996.

His father, who had a small appointment in the customs, gave his son the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> which every one of decent rank then received in a country where the avenues to learning were easy, and open to men of the most moderate circumstances. After having passed through the tuition of a grammar school, he was put <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> to a printer; and when a very young man, removed to a wider sphere in that line of business, and went to follow his trade in London. Sober, diligent, and attentive, while his emoluments were for some time very scanty, he contrived to live rather within than beyond his income; and though he married early, and without such a provision as prudence might have looked for in the establishment of a family, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to thrive, and to better his circumstances. This he would often mention as an encouragement to early matrimony; and used to say, that he never had a child born that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> did not send some increase of income to provide for the increase of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>. With sufficient vigour of mind, he had that happy flow of animal spirits that is not easily discouraged by unpromising appearances.\n\nHis abilities in his profession, accompanied with perfect integrity and unabating diligence, enabled him, after the first difficulties were overcome, to advance with rapid success. And he was one of the most flourishing men of the trade, when, in the year 1770, he purchased a share of the patent for king's printer of Mr Eyre, with whom he maintained the most cordial intimacy during the rest of his life. Beside the emoluments arising from this appointment, as well as from a very extensive private business, he now drew largely from a field which required some degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> sagacity to cultivate on account of the great literary property which he acquired by purchasing the copy-rights of the most celebrated authors of the time. In this his liberality kept pace with his prudence, and in some cases went perhaps rather beyond it. Never had such rewards been given to the labours of literary men as now were received from him and his associates in those purchases of copy-rights from authors.\n\nHaving now attained the first great object of business, wealth, Mr Strahan looked with a very allowable ambition on the stations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> rank and eminence. Politics had long occupied his active mind, which he had for many years pursued as his favourite amusement, by corresponding on that subject with some of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the age. Mr Strahan's queries to Dr Franklin in the year 1769, reflecting the discontentments of the Americans, published in the London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a> of 28th July 1778, show the just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> he entertained of the important consequences of that dispute, and his anxiety as a good subject to investigate, at that early period, the proper means by which their grievances might be removed, and a permanent harmony restored between the two countries. In the year 1775 he was elected a member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> for the borough of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, with a very illustrious colleague, the Hon. C. J. Fox; and in the succeeding parliament, for Wootton Bassett, in the same county. In this station, applying himself with that industry which was natural to him, he was a useful member, and attended the house with scrupulous punctuality. His talents for business acquired the consideration to which they were entitled, and were not unnoticed by the minister.\n\nIn his political connection he was constant to the friends to whom he had first been attached. He was a steady supporter of that party who were turned out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> in spring 1784, and lost his seat in the house of commons by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of parliament with which that change was followed: a situation which he did not shew any desire to resume on the return of the new parliament; arising from a feeling of some decline in his health, which had rather suffered from the long fittings and late hours with which the political warfare in the preceding had been attended. Without any fixed disease, his strength visibly declined; and though his spirits survived his strength, yet the vigour and activity of his mind were considerably impaired. Both continued gradually to decline till his death, which happened on the 9th of July 1785 in the 71st year of his age.\n\nEndued with much natural sagacity, and an attentive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of life, he owed his rise to that station of opulence and respect which he attained, rather to his own talents and exertion, than to any accidental occurrence of favourable or fortunate circumstances. His mind was not unformed by letters; and from a habit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to style, he acquired a considerable portion of critical acuteness in the discernment of its beauties and defects. In one branch of writing he particularly excelled\u2014the epistolary; in which he not only showed the precision and clearness of business, but possessed a neatness as well as a fluency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which few letter-writers have been known to surpass. Letter-writing was one of his favourite amusements; and among his correspondents were men of such eminence and talents as well repaid his endeavours to entertain them. Among these, as before mentioned, was the justly celebrated Dr Franklin, originally a printer like Mr Strahan, whose friendship and correspondence, notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their sentiments in political matters,\nhe continued to enjoy till his death. One of the latest letters which he received from his illustrious and venerable friend contained a humorous allegory of the state of politics in Britain, drawn from the profession of printing; of which, though the doctor had quitted the exercise, he had not forgotten the terms.\n\nThe judicious disposition which Mr Strahan made of his property, affords an evident proof of his good sense and propriety. After providing sufficiently for his widow and children, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> study seems to have been to mitigate the affliction of those (and many there were) who would more immediately have felt his loss, by bequeathing them liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a> for their lives; and (recalling that all of a profession are not equally provident) he left \u00a31000. to the Company of Stationers, the interest to be divided among inform old printers.\n\nAs the virtuous connections of the life and the heart are always pleasing to trace,\u2014of Mr Strahan it may briefly be said, that his capacity, diligence, and probity, raised him to the head of his profession. The good humour and obliging disposition which he owed to nature, he cultivated with care, and confirmed by habit. His sympathetic heart beat time to the joy and sorrow of his friends. His advice was always ready to direct youth, and his purse open to relieve indigence. Living in times not the purest in the English annals, he escaped unfulfilled through the artifices of trade and the corruption of politics. In him a strong natural figuracy, improved by an extensive knowledge of the world, served only to render respectable his unaffected simplicity of manners, and to make his Christian philanthropy more discerning and useful. The uninterrupted health and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> which accompanied him for half a century in the capital, proves honesty to be the best policy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> the greatest luxury, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> duties of life its most agreeable amusement. In his elevated fortune, none of his former acquaintance ever accused him of neglect. He attained prosperity without envy, enjoyed wealth without pride, and dispensed bounty without ostentation.","sp":374,"ep":375},{"h":"STRAIKS","t":"in the military art, are strong plates of iron, fixed in number, fixed with large nails called straik-naits, on the circumference of a cannon-wheel, over the joints of the fellows; both to strengthen the wheel, and to save the fellows from wearing on hard ways or streets.","sp":375,"ep":375},{"h":"STRAIN","t":"a pain occasioned by the violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of some membranous or tendinous part.","sp":375,"ep":375},{"h":"STRAIN","t":"Stress, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>, are terms indiscriminately used to express the force which is excited in any part of a machine or structure of any kind tending to break it in that part.

Modest as he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, he used to say that the works of an artist should serve for his life and monument. His works no doubt will perpetuate his name whilst any taste for the fine arts remains.\n\nSir Robert Strange was born in the island of Pomona in Orkney, July the 14th 1721; and died at London July the 5th 1792. He was lineally descended from David Strange or Strang, a younger son of the family of the Stranges or Strangs of Balcaisky, in the county of Fife, who settled in Orkney at the time of the Reformation. But as there were no males remaining of the elder branch of the Stranges of Balcaisky, Sir Robert became the male <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of it, and was found by a legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> to have a right to the armorial bearings and every other mark of honour belonging to that ancient family.\n\nHe received his classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at Kirkwall in Orkney, under the care of a learned, worthy, and much respected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, Mr Macdonald Mackenzie, who has rendered infinite service to his country by the accurate surveys and charts he has given of the islands of Orkney, Shetland, and of the British and Irish coasts.\n\nOriginally intended for the law, Mr Strange soon became tired of that profession, and perceived that his genius decisively led him to the arts of drawing and engraving. For this purpose he was introduced to the late Mr Richard Cooper at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, the only person there who had then any taste in that line of the fine arts. He was bound with him as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> for six years; during which time he made such progress in his new profession, that his friends entertained the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of his success; nor were they disappointed.\n\nIn the year 1747 he married Isabella, only daughter of William Lumiden, son of Bishop Lumiden; and soon after his marriage he went to France, where with the most ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> he prosecuted his studies, chiefly at Paris, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the celebrated Le Bas, who engraved many excellent prints from the Dutch painters. It was from Le Bas he had the first hint of the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> commonly called the dry needle; but which he afterwards greatly improved by his own genius, and which has added such superior beauties to his engravings.\n\nIn the year 1751 Mr Strange removed with his family from Edinburgh and settled at London, where he engraved several fine historical prints, which justly acquired to him great reputation. At this period historical engraving had made little progress in Britain, and he may be properly considered as its father.\n\nThe admiration he always had for the works of the great Italian painters made him long desire to visit Italy, the seat of the fine arts; and the farther he advanced in life, he became the more persuaded that a journey to that country was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to an artist who had the laudable ambition to excel in his profession. He therefore undertook this journey in the year 1760. In Italy he made many admirable drawings, several of which he afterwards engraved. These drawings are now in the possession of Lord Dundas.\n\nEverywhere in Italy singular marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> were bestowed on Mr Strange; not only by great personages, but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> of the fine arts in that country. He was made a member of the academies of Rome, Florence, and Bologna, and professor in the royal academy at Parma.\n\nTo show the estimation in which his talents were held at Rome, we cannot but record the following anecdote. The ceiling of the room of the Vatican library, in which the collection of engravings is kept, is elegantly painted by Signor Rotarielli. It represents the portraits of engravers; and the portraits of the most eminent artists in that line are there introduced, among which is that of our artist. Under his arm he holds a portfolio, on which his name is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a>. He is the only British artist on whom this honour has been conferred.\n\nIn France, where he resided many years at different periods, his talents likewise received every mark of attention that could be bestowed on a foreigner. He was made a member of the royal academy of painting at Paris.\n\nHis majesty King George III., ever attentive to the progress of the fine arts in Britain, and sensible of the advantages of which engraving particularly has been to\nStrange. this country, even in a commercial light; and desirous to give a mark of his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of the merit of Mr Strange, whom he considered as at the head of his profession and the great improver of it\u2014was graciously pleased to confer the honour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> on him the 5th of January 1787.\n\nSuch was Sir Robert Strange as an artist; nor was he less distinguished by his truly amiable moral qualities, which endeared him to all who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> to know him.\n\nWith regard to his works, he left fifty capital plates, still in good condition, which are carefully preserved in his family. They are engraved from pictures by the most celebrated painters of the Roman, Florentine, Lombard, Venetian, and other schools. They are historical, both sacred and profane, poetical, allegorical.\n\nFrom his earliest establishment in life, Sir Robert carefully preserved about eighty copies of the finest and most choice impressions of each plate he engraved; which, from length of time, have acquired a beauty, mellowness, and brilliancy, easier seen than described. He did this with a view of presenting them to the public at a period when age should disable him from adding to their number. These he collected into as many volumes, and arranged them in the order in which they were engraved. To each volume he prefixed two portraits of himself, on the same plate, the one an etching, the other a finished proof, from a drawing by John Baptiste Greuze. This is the last plate which he engraved; and is a proof that neither his eyes nor hand were impaired by age. It likewise shows the use he made both of aquafortis and the graver. Each volume, besides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> to the king, contains an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> on the progress of engraving, and critical remarks on the pictures from which his engravings are taken. These volumes were ready to be given to the public, when Sir Robert's death delayed this magnificent publication; a publication which does so much honour to the artist, and to the country which gave him birth. He died at London 5th July 1792.\n\nThe following is an authentic catalogue of his works.\n\nPlate 1.

One reason why we cannot penetrate to any great depth is, that as we go down the air becomes foul, loaded with pernicious vapours, inflammable air, fixed air, &c. which destroy the miners, and there is no possibility of going on. In many places, however, these vapours become pernicious much sooner than in others, particularly where fulphureous minerals abound, as in mines of metal, coal, &c.\n\nBut however great differences there may be among the under strata, the upper one is in some respects the same all over the globe, at least in this respect, that it is fit for the support of vegetables, which the others are not, without long exposure to the air. Properly speaking, indeed, the upper stratum of the earth all round, is composed of the pure vegetable mould, though in many places it is mixed with large quantities of other strata, as clay, sand, gravel, &c.; and hence proceed the differences of soils so well known to those who practice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>.\n\nIt has been supposed, by some naturalists, that the different strata of which the earth is composed were originally formed at the creation, and have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a manner immutable ever since: but this cannot possibly have been the case, since we find that many of the strata are strangely intermixed with each other; the bones of animals both marine and terrestrial are frequently found at great depths in the earth; beds of oyster-shells are found of immense extent in several countries; and concerning these and other shell-fish, it is remarkable, that they are generally found much farther from the surface than the bones or teeth either of marine or terrestrial animals. Neither are the shells or other remains of fish found in those countries adjoining to the seas where they grow naturally, but in the most distant regions.

The man of science who visits our great manufactories is delighted with the ingenuity which he observes in every part, the innumerable inventions which come even from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> artisans, and the determined purpose of improvement and refinement which he sees in every workshop. Every cotton mill appears an academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> science; and mechanical invention is spreading from these fountains over the whole kingdom. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> is mortified to see this ardent spirit so cramped by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of principle, and many of these original and brilliant thoughts obscured and clogged with needless and even hurtful additions, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of machinery which checks improvement even by its appearance of ingenuity.

We have no means of instruction, except two very short and abstracted treatises of the late Mr Emerson on the strength of materials. We do not recollect a performance in our language from which our artists can get <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. Treatises written expressly on different branches of mechanical arts are totally silent on this, which is the basis and only principle of their performances. Who would imagine that Price's British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTER\">Carpenter</a>, the work of the first reputation in this country, and of which the sole aim is to teach the carpenter to erect solid and durable structures, does not contain one proposition or one reason by which one form of a thing can be shown to be stronger or weaker than another? We doubt very much if one carpenter in a hundred can give a reason to convince his own mind that a joist is stronger when laid on its edge than when laid on its broad side. We speak in this strong manner in hopes of exciting some man of science to publish a system of instruction on this subject. The limits of our Work will not admit of a detail; but we think it necessary to point out the leading principles, and to give the traces of that systematic connection by which all the knowledge already possessed of this subject may be brought.\nStrength of brought together and properly arranged. This we shall now attempt in as brief a manner as we are able.\n\nThe strength of materials arises immediately or ultimately from the cohesion of the parts of bodies. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of this property of tangible matter has as yet been very partial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, and by no means enables us to apply mathematical calculations with precision and success. The various modifications of cohesion, in its different appearances of perfect softness, pliability, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCTILITY\">ductility</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, hardness, have a mighty influence on the strength of bodies, but are hardly susceptible of measurement. Their texture also, whether uniform like glass and ductile metals, crystallized or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> like other metals and freestone, or fibrous like timber, is a circumstance no less important; yet even here, although we derive some advantage from remarking to which of these forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGGREGATION\">aggregation</a> a substance belongs, the aid is but small. All we can do in this want of general principles is to make experiments on every class of bodies. Accordingly philosophers have endeavoured to instruct the public in this particular. The Royal Society of London at its very first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> made many experiments at their meetings, as may be seen in the first registers of the Society*. Several individuals have added their experiments. The most numerous collection in detail is by Mulschenbroek, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a> at Leyden. Part of it was published by himself in his Essais de Physique, in two vols. 4to; but the full collection is to be found in his System of Natural Philosophy, published after his death by Lulofs, in three vols 4to. This was translated from the Low Dutch into French by Sigaud de la Fond, and published at Paris in 1762, and is a prodigious collection of physical knowledge of all kinds, and may almost suffice for a library of natural philosophy. But this collection of experiments on the cohesion of bodies is not of that value which one expects. We presume that they were carefully made and faithfully narrated; but they were made on such small specimens, that the unavoidable natural inequalities of growth or texture produced irregularities in the results which bore too great a proportion to the whole quantities observed. We may make the same remark on the experiments of Couplet, Pitot, De la Hire, Du Hamel, and others of the French academy. In short, if we except the experiments of Buffon on the strength of timber, made at the public expense on a large scale, there is nothing to be met with from which we can obtain absolute measures which may be employed with confidence; and there is nothing in the English language except a simple list by Emeron, which is merely a set of affirmations, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> of circumstances, to enable us to judge of the validity of its conclusions: but the character of Mr Emeron, as a man of knowledge and of integrity, gives even to these assertions a considerable value.\n\nBut to make use of any experiments, there must be employed some general principle by which we can generalize their results. They will otherwise be only narratives of detached facts. We must have some notion of that intermediate, by the intervention of which an external force applied to one part of a lever, joint, or pillar, occasions a strain on a distant part. This can be nothing but the cohesion between the parts. It is this connecting force which is brought into action, or, as we more shortly express it, excited. This action is modified in every part by the laws of mechanics. It is this action which is what we call the strength of that part, and its effect is the strain on the adjoining parts; and thus it is the same force, differently viewed, that constitutes both the strain and the strength. When we consider it in the light of a resistance to fracture, we call it strength.\n\nWe call everything a force which we observe to be ever accompanied by a change of motion; or, more strictly speaking, we infer the presence and agency of a force wherever we observe the state of things in respect of motion different from what we know to be the result of the action of all the forces which we know to act on the body. Thus when we observe a rope prevent a body from falling, we infer a moving force inherent in the rope with as much confidence as when we observe it drag the body along the ground. The immediate action of this force is undoubtedly exerted between the immediately adjoining parts of the rope. The immediate effect is the keeping the particles of the rope together. They ought to separate by any external force drawing the ends of the rope contrarywise; and we ascribe their not doing so to a mechanical force really opposing this external force. When desired to give it a name, we name it from what we conceive to be its effect, and therefore its characteristic, and we call it cohesion. This is merely a name for the fact; but it is the same thing in all our denominations. We know nothing of the cause but in the effects; and our name for the cause is in fact the name of the effect, which is cohesion. We mean nothing else by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>. What do we mean when we say that Newton understood thoroughly the nature of gravitation, of the force of gravitation; or that Franklin understood the nature of the electric force? Nothing but this: Newton considered with patient sagacity the general facts of gravitation, and has described and classified them with the utmost precision. In like manner, we shall understand the nature of cohesion when we have discovered with equal generality the laws of cohesion, or general facts which are observed in the appearances, and when we have described and classified them with equal accuracy.\n\nLet us therefore attend to the more simple and obvious phenomena of cohesion, and mark with care every circumstance of resemblance by which they may be clasped. Let us receive these as the laws of cohesion, characteristic of its supposed cause, the force of cohesion. We cannot pretend to enter on this vast research. The modifications are innumerable; and it would require the penetration of more than Newton to detect the circumstance of similarity amidst millions of discriminating circumstances. Yet this is the only way of discovering which are the primary facts characteristic of the force, and which are the modifications. The study is immense, but it is by no means desperate; and we entertain great hopes that it will ere long be successfully prosecuted: but, in our particular predicament, we must content ourselves with selecting such general laws as seem to give us the most immediate information of the circumstances that must be attended to by the mechanician in his constructions, that he may unite strength with simplicity, economy, and energy.\n\nThen, it is a matter of fact that all bodies are in a certain\nStrength of certain degree perfectly elastic; that is, when their form or bulk is changed by certain moderate compressions or distractions, it requires the continuance of the changing force to continue the body in this new state; and when the force is removed, the body recovers its original form.\n\nWe limit this affection to certain moderate changes: For instance, take a lead wire of one-fifteenth of an inch in diameter and ten feet long; fix one end firmly to the ceiling, and let the wire hang <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>; affix to the lower end an index like the hand of a watch; on some stand immediately below let there be a circle divided into degrees, with its centre corresponding to the lower point of the wire: now turn this index twice round, and thus twist the wire. When the index is let go, it will turn backwards again, by the wire's untwisting itself, and make almost four revolutions before it stops; after which it twists and untwists many times, the index going backwards and forwards round the circle, diminishing however its arch of twist each time, till at last it settles precisely in its original position. This may be repeated for ever. Now, in this motion, every part of the wire partsake equally of the twist. The particles are stretched, require force to keep them in their state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, and recover completely their relative positions. These are all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of what the mechanician calls perfect elasticity. This is a quality quite familiar in many cases; as in glass, tempered steel, &c., but was thought incompetent to lead, which is generally considered as having little or no elasticity. But we make the affection in the most general terms, with the limitation to moderate derangement of form. We have made the same experiment on a thread of pipe-clay, made by forcing soft clay through the small hole of a syringe by means of a screw; and we found it more elastic than the lead wire: for a thread of one-twentieth of an inch diameter and seven feet long allowed the index to make two turns, and yet completely recovered its first position.\n\n2. But if we turn the index of the lead wire four times round, and let it go again, it untwists again in the same manner, but it makes little more than four turns back again; and after many oscillations it finally stops in a position almost two revolutions removed from its original position. It has now acquired a new arrangement of parts, and this new arrangement is permanent like the former; and, what is of particular moment, it is perfectly elastic. This change is familiarly known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of a set. The wire is said to have taken a set. When we attend minutely to the procedure of nature in this phenomenon, we find that the particles have as it were slid on each other, still cohering, and have taken a new position, in which their connecting forces are in equilibrium: and in this change of relative situation, it appears that the connecting forces which maintained the particles in their first situation were not in equilibrium in some position intermediate between that of the first and that of the last form. The force required for changing this first form augmented with the change, but only to a certain degree; and during this process the connecting forces always tended to the recovery of this first form. But after the change of mutual position has passed a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, the union has been partly destroyed, and the particles have been brought into new situations; such, that the forces which now connect each with its neighbour tend, not to the recovery of the first arrangement, but to push them farther from it, into a new situation, to which they now verge, and require force to prevent them from acquiring. The wire is now in fact again perfectly elastic; that is, the forces which now connect the particles with their neighbours augment to a certain degree as the derangement from this new position augments. This is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> from any theory. It is narrating facts, on which a theory is to be founded. What we have been just now saying is evidently a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of that sensible form of tangible matter which we call ductility. It has every gradation of variety, from the softness of butter to the firmness of gold. All these bodies have some elasticity; but we say they are not perfectly elastic, because they do not completely recover their original form when it has been greatly damaged. The whole gradation may be most distinctly observed in a piece of glass or hard sealing wax. In the ordinary form glass is perhaps the most completely elastic body that we know, and may be bent till just ready to snap, and yet completely recovers its first form, and takes no set whatever; but when heated to such a degree as just to be visible in the dark, it loses its brittleness, and becomes so tough that it cannot be broken by any blow; but it is no longer elastic, takes any set, and keeps it. When more heated, it becomes as plastic as clay; but in this state is remarkably distinguished from clay by a quality which we may call viscosity, which is something like elasticity, of which clay and other bodies purely plastic exhibit no appearance. This is the joint operation of strong adhesion and softness. When a rod of perfectly soft glass is suddenly stretched a little, it does not at once take the shape which it acquires after some little time. It is owing to this, that in taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of a seal, if we take off the seal while the wax is yet very hot, the sharpness of the impression is destroyed immediately. Each part drawing its neighbour, and each part yielding, the prominent parts are pulled down and blunted, and the sharp hollows are pulled upwards and also blunted. The seal must be kept on till all has become not only stiff but hard.\n\nThis viscosity is to be observed in all plastic bodies, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a>. It is not observed in clay, being in all homogeneous it is not homogeneous, but consists of hard particles of argillaceous earth sticking together by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for water. Something like it might be made of finely powdered glass and a clammy fluid such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>. Viscosity has all degrees of softness till it degenerates to ropy fluidity like that of olive oil. Perhaps something of it may be found even in the most perfect fluid that we are acquainted with, as we observed in the experiments for ascertaining specific gravity.\n\nThere is in a late volume of the Philosophical Transactions a narrative of experiments, by which it appears that the thread of the spider is an exception to our first general law, and that it is perfectly ductile. It is there asserted, that a long thread of gossamer, furnished with an index, takes any position whatever; and that though the index be turned round any number of times (even many hundreds), it has no tendency to recover its first form. The thread takes completely any set whatever. We have not had an opportunity of repeating this experiment, but we have distinctly observed a phenomenon totally inconsistent with it. If a fibre of gossamer about an inch long be held by the end horizontally, it bends downward.\nStrength of downward in a curve like a slender slip of whalebone or a hair. If totally devoid of elasticity, and perfectly indifferent to any fet, it would hang down perpendicularly without any curvature.\n\nWhen ductility and elasticity are combined in different proportions, an immense variety of sensible modes of aggregation may be produced. Some degree of both are probably to be observed in all bodies of complex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; that is, which consist of particles made up of many different kinds of atoms. Such a constitution of a body must afford many situations permanent, but easily deranged.\n\nIn all these changes of disposition which take place among the particles of a ductile body, the particles are at such distance that they still cohere. The body may be stretched a little; and on removing the extending force, the body shrinks into its first form. It also resists moderate compressions; and when the compressing force is removed, the body swells out again. Now the corporeal fact here is, that the particles are acted on by attractions and repulsions, which balance each other when no external force is acting on the body, and which augment as the particles are made, by any external cause, to recede from this situation of mutual inactivity; for since force is requisite to produce either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> or the compression, and to maintain it, we are obliged, by the constitution of our minds, to infer that it is opposed by a force accompanying or inherent in every particle of dilatable or compressible matter; and as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of employing force to produce a change indicates the agency of these corporeal forces, and marks their kind, according as the tendencies of the particles appear to be toward each other in dilatation, or from each other in compression; so it also measures the degrees of their intensity. Should it require three times the force to produce a double compression, we must reckon the mutual repulsions triple when the compression is doubled; and so in other instances. We see from all this that the phenomena of cohesion indicate some relation between the centres of the particles. To discover this relation is the great problem in corporeal mechanism, as it was in the Newtonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the force of gravitation. Could we discover this law of action between the corporeal with the same certainty and definiteness, we might with equal confidence say what will be the result of any position which we give to the particles of bodies; but this is beyond our hopes. The law of gravitation is so simple, that the discovery or detection of it amid the variety of celestial phenomena required but one step; and in its own nature its possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> still do not greatly exceed the powers of human research. One is almost disposed to say that the Supreme Being has exhibited it to our reasoning powers as sufficient to employ with success our utmost efforts, but not so abstruse as to discourage us from the noble attempt. It seems to be otherwise with respect to cohesion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> informs us, that if it deviates sensibly from the law of gravitation, the simplest combinations will make the joint action of several particles an almost impenetrable mystery. We must therefore content ourselves, for a long time to come, with a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the simplest cases that we can propose, and with the discovery of secondary laws of action, in which many particles combine their influence. In pursuance of this plan, we observe,\n\n3. That whatever is the situation of the particles of a body with respect to each other, when in a quiescent state, they are kept in these situations by the balance of opposite forces. This cannot be refused, nor can we particles form to ourselves any other notion of the state of the kept in particles of a body. Whether we suppose the ultimate their places to be of certain magnitudes and shapes, touch, by a balance of each other in single points of cohesion; or whether forces, we (with Bolzovich) consider them as at a distance from each other, and acting on each other by attractions and repulsions\u2014we must acknowledge, in the first place, that the centres of the particles (by whose mutual distances we must estimate the distance of the particles) may and do vary their distances from each other. What else can we say when we observe a body increase in length, in breadth, and in thickness, by heating it, or when we see it diminish in all these dimensions by an external compression? A particle, therefore, situated in the midst of many others, and remaining in that situation, must be conceived as maintained in it by the mutual balancing of all the forces which connect it with its neighbours. It is like a ball kept in its place by the opposite action of two springs. This illustration meriteth of a more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>. Suppose a number of this proposal balls ranged on the table in the angles of equilateral triangles, and that each ball is connected with the six which lie around it by means of an elastic wire curled like a cork-screw; suppose such another stratum of balls above this, and parallel to it, and so placed that each ball of the upper stratum is perpendicularly over the centre of the equilateral triangle below, and let these be connected with the balls of the under stratum by similar spiral wires. Let there be a third and a fourth, and any number of such strata, all connected in the same manner. It is plain that this may extend to any size and fill any space.\u2014Now let this assemblage of balls be firmly contemplated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and be supposed to think continually in all its dimensions, till the balls, and their distances from each other, and the connecting wires, all vanish from the sight as discrete individual objects. All this is very conceivable. It will now appear like a solid body, having length, breadth, and thickness; it may be compressed, and will again resume its dimensions; it may be stretched, and will again shrink; it will move, away when struck; in short, it will not differ in its sensible appearance from a solid elastic body. Now when this body is in a state of compression, for instance, it is evident that any one of the balls is at rest, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the mutual balancing of the actions of all the spiral wires which connect it with those around it. It will greatly conduce to the full understanding of all that follows to recur to this illustration. The analogy or resemblance between the effects of this constitution of things and the effects of the corporeal forces is very great; and wherever it obtains, we may safely draw conclusions from what we know would be the condition of a body of common tangible matter. We shall just give one instructive example, and then have done with this plausible hypothetical body. We can suppose it of a long shape, resting on one point; we can suppose two weights A, B, suspended at the extremities, and the whole in equilibrium. We commonly express this state of things by saying that A and B are in equilibrium. This is very inaccurate. A is in fact in equilibrium with the united actions of all the springs which connect the ball to which it is applied with\nStrength of with the adjoining balls. These springs are brought into action, and each is in equilibrium with the joint action of all the rest. Thus through the whole extent of the hypothetical body, the springs are brought into action in a way and in a degree which mathematics can easily investigate. We need not do this: it is enough for our purpose that our imagination readily discovers that some springs are stretched, others are compressed, and that a pressure is excited on the middle point of support; and the support exerts a reaction which precisely balances it; and the other weight is, in like manner, in immediate equilibrium with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> of the actions of all the springs which connect the last ball with its neighbours.\n\nNow take the analogical or resembling case, an oblong piece of solid matter, resting on a fulcrum, and loaded with two weights in equilibrium. For the actions of the connecting springs substitute the corpuscular forces, and the result will resemble that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>.\n\nNow as there is something that is at least analogous to a change of distance of the particles, and a concomitant change of the intensity of the connecting forces, we may express this in the same way that we are accustomed to do in similar cases. Let A and B (fig. 1.) represent the centres of two particles of a coherent elastic body in their quiescent inactive state, and let us consider only the mechanical condition of B. The body may be stretched. In this case the distance A.B of the particles may become A.C. In this state there is something which makes it necessary to employ a force to keep the particles at this distance. C has a tendency towards A, or we may say that A attracts C. We may represent the magnitude of this tendency of C towards A, or this attraction of A, by a line Cc perpendicular to A.C. Again, the body may be compressed, and the distance A.B may become A.D. Something obliges us to employ force to continue this compression; and D tends from A, or A appears to repel D. The intensity of this tendency or repulsion may be represented by another perpendicular D.d; and, to represent the different directions of these tendencies, or the different nature of these actions, we may set D.d on the opposite side of A.B. It is in this manner that the Abb\u00e9 Bofcovitch has represented the actions of corpuscular forces in his celebrated Theory of Natural Philosophy. Newton had said, that, as the great movements of the solar system were regulated by forces operating at a distance, and varying with the distance, so he strongly suspected (valde supposio) that all the phenomena of cohesion, with all its modifications in the different sensible forms of aggregation, and in the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> and physiology, resulted from the similar agency of forces varying with the distance of the particles. The learned Jesuit pursued this thought; and has shown, that if we suppose an ultimate atom of matter endowed with powers of attraction and repulsion, varying, both in kind and degree, with the distance, and if this force be the same in every atom, it may be regulated by such a relation to the distance from the neighbouring atom, that a collection of such may have all the sensible appearance of bodies in their different forms of solids, liquids, and vapours, elastic or unelastic, and endowed with all the properties which we perceive, by whose immediate operation the phenomena of motion by impulse, and all the phenomena of chemistry, and of animal and vegetable economy, may be produced. He shows, that notwithstanding a perfect sameness, and even a great simplicity in this atomic constitution, there will result from this union all that unspeakable variety of form and property which diversify and embellish the face of nature. We shall take another opportunity of giving such an account of this celebrated work as it deserves. We mention it only, by the bye, as far as a general notion of it will be of some service on the present occasion. For this purpose, we just observe that Bofcovitch conceives a particle of any individual species of matter to consist of an unknown number of particles of simpler constitution; each of which particles, in their turn, is compounded of particles still more simply constituted, and so on through an unknown number of orders, till we arrive at the simplest possible constitution of a particle of tangible matter, susceptible of length, breadth, and thickness, and necessarily consisting of four atoms of matter. And he shows that the more complex we suppose the constitution of a particle, the more must the sensible qualities of the aggregate resemble the observed qualities of tangible bodies. In particular, he shows how a particle may be so constituted, that although it act on one other particle of the same kind through a considerable interval, the interposition of a third particle of the same kind may render it totally, or almost totally, inactive; and therefore an affiniment of such particles would form such a fluid as air. All these curious inferences are made with uncontroversible evidence; and the greatest encouragement is thus given to the mathematical philosopher to hope, that by cautious and patient proceeding in this way, we may gradually approach to a knowledge of the laws of cohesion, that will not then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> even with the Principia of Newton. No step can be made in this investigation, but by observing with care, and generalizing with judgement, the phenomena, which are abundantly numerous, and much more at our command than those of the great and sensible motions of bodies. Following this plan, we observe,\n\n4. It is matter of fact, that every body has some degree of compressibility and dilatability; and when the common changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> are so moderate that the body is completely recover its original dimensions on the cessation of the changing force, the extensions or compressions are sensibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the extending or compressing forces; and therefore the connecting forces are proportional to the distances of the particles from their quiescent, neutral, or inactive position. This seems to have been first viewed as a law of nature by the penetrating eye of Dr Robert Hooke, one of the most eminent natural philosophers of the last century. He published a cipher, which he said contained the theory of springiness, and of Dr Hooke, the motions of bodies by the action of springs. It was this, ceiinossstuu.\u2014When explained in his dissertation, published some years after, it was ut tenfso fiovis. This is precisely the proposition just now asserted as a general fact, a law of nature. This dissertation is full of curious observations of facts in support of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a>. In his application to the motion of bodies he gives his noble discovery of the balance-spring of a watch, which is founded on this law. The spring, as it is more and more coiled up, or unwound, by the motion of the balance, acts on it with a force proportional to the distance of the balance from its quiescent position. The balance therefore is acted on by an accelerating force, which varies in the same manner as the force of gravity.\nStrength of gravity acting on a pendulum swinging in a cycloid. Its vibrations therefore must be performed in equal time, whether they are wide or narrow. In the same dissertation Hooke mentions all the facts which John Bernoulli afterwards adduced in support of Leibnitz's whimsical doctrine of the force of bodies in motion, or the doctrine of the vis viva; a doctrine which Hooke might justly have claimed as his own, had he not seen its futility.\n\nExperiments made since the time of Hooke show that this law is strictly true in the extent to which we have limited it, viz. in all the changes of form which will be completely undone by the elasticity of the body. It is nearly true to a much greater extent. James Bernoulli, in his dissertation on the elastic curve, relates some experiments of his own, which seem to deviate considerably from it; but on close examination they do not. The finest experiments are those of Coulomb, published in some late volumes of the memoirs of the Academy of Paris. He suspended balls by wires, and observed their motions of oscillation, which he found accurately corresponding with this law.\n\nThis we shall find to be a very important fact in the doctrine of the strength of bodies, and we desire the reader to make it familiar to his mind. If we apply to this our manner of expressing these forces by perpendicular ordinates Cc, Dd (fig. 1), we must take other situations E, F, of the particle B, and draw Ee, Ff; and we must have Da : Fa = BD : BF, or Ce : Ee = BC : BE. In such a proposition FaBce must be a straight line. But we shall have abundant evidence by and bye that this cannot be strictly true, and that the line Bce which limits the ordinates expressing the attractive forces becomes concave towards the line ABE, and that the part Bdf is convex towards it. All that can be safely concluded from the experiments hitherto made is, that to a certain extent the forces, both attractive and repulsive, are sensibly proportional to the dilatations and compressions.\n\nFor,\n\n5. It is universally observed, that when the dilatations have proceeded a certain length, a less addition of force is sufficient to increase the dilatation in the same degree. This is always observed when the body has been so far stretched that it takes a set, and does not completely recover its form. The like may be generally observed in compressions. Most persons will recollect, that in violently stretching an elastic cord, it becomes suddenly weaker, or more easily stretched. But these phenomena do not positively prove a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the corpuscular force acting on one particle: it more probably arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of some particles, whose action contributed to the whole or sensible effect. And in compressions we may suppose something of the same kind; for when we compress a body in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, it commonly bulges out in another; and in cases of very violent action some particles may be disunited, whose transverse action had formerly balanced part of the compressing force. For the reader will see on reflection, that since the compression in one direction causes the body to bulge out in the transverse direction; and since this bulging out is in opposition to the transverse forces of attraction, it must employ some part of the compressing force. And the common appearances are in perfect uniformity with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of things. When we press a bit of dryish clay, it swells out and cracks transversely. When a pillar of wood is overloaded, it swells out, and small crevices appear in the direction of the fibres. After this it will not bear half of the load. This the carpenters call crippling; and a knowledge of the circumstances which modify it is of great importance, and enables us to understand some very paradoxical appearances, as will be shown by and bye.\n\nThis partial diffusing of particles formerly cohering is, we imagine, the chief reason why the totality of the forces which really oppose an external strain does not increase in the proportion of the extensions and compressions. But sufficient evidence will also be given that the forces which would connect one particle with one other particle do not augment in the accurate proportion of the change of distance; that in extensions they increase more slowly, and in compressions more rapidly.\n\nBut there is another cause of this deviation perhaps equally effectual with the former. Most bodies manifest another degree of ductility. Now what is this? The fact cause of is, that the parts have taken a new arrangement, in deviation, which they again cohere. Therefore, in the passage to this new arrangement, the sensible forces, which are the joint result of many corpuscular forces, begin to respect this new arrangement instead of the former. This must change the simple law of corpuscular force, characteristic of the particular species of matter under examination. It does not require much reflection to convince us that the possible arrangements which the particles of a body may acquire, without appearing to change their nature, must be more numerous according as the particles are of a more complex constitution; and it is reasonable to suppose that the constitution even of the most simple kind of matter that we are acquainted with is exceedingly complex. Our microscopes show us animals so minute, that a heap of them must appear to the naked eye an uniform mass with a grain finer than that of the finest marble or razor hone; and yet each of these has not only limbs, but bones, muscular fibres, blood-vessels, fibres, and a blood constituting, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, of globules organized and complex like our own. The imagination is here lost in wonder; and nothing is left us but to adore inconceivable art and wisdom, and to exult in the thought that we are the only spectators of this beautiful scene who can derive pleasure from the view. What is trodden under foot with indifference, even by the half-reasoning elephant, may be made by us the source of the purest and most unmixed pleasure. But let us proceed to observe,\n\n6. That the forces which connect the particles of tangible bodies change by a change of distance, not only in degree, but also in kind. The particle B (fig. 1) is attracted by A when in the situation C or E. It is repelled by it when at D or F. It is not affected by it when in the situation B. The reader is requested care, change by fully to remark, that this is not an inference founded on a change of distances, the authority of our mathematical figure. The figure is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> (to assist the imagination) of facts in nature. It requires no force to keep the particles of a body in their quiescent situations: but if they are separated by stretching the body, they endeavour (pardon the figurative expression) to come together again. If they are brought nearer by compression, they endeavour to recede. This endeavour is manifested by the necessity of employing force to maintain the extension or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a>; and we represent this by the different position.\nStrength of our lines. But this is not all: the particle B, which is repelled by A when in the situation F or D, is neutral when at B, and is attracted when at C or E, may be placed at such a distance AG from A greater than AB that it shall again be repelled, or at such a distance AH that it shall again be attracted; and these alterations may be repeated again and again. This is curious and important, and requires something more than a bare affe- fation for its proof.\n\nIn the article Optics we mentioned the most curious and valuable observations of Sir Isaac Newton, by which it appears that light is thus alternately attracted and repelled by bodies. The rings of colour which appear between the object glasses of long telescopes showed, that in the small interval of \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch, there are at least an hundred such changes observable, and that it is highly probable that these alterations extend to a much greater distance. At one of these distances the light actually converges towards the solid matter of the glass, which we express shortly, by saying that it is attracted by it; and that at the next distance it declines from the glass, or is repelled by it. The same thing is more simply inferred from the phenomena of light falling by the edges of knives and other opaque bodies. We refer the reader to the experiments themselves, the detail being too long for this place; and we request him to consider them minutely and attentively, and to form distinct notions of the inferences drawn from them. And we desire it to be remarked, that although Sir Isaac, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, always considers light as a set of corpuscles moving in free space, and obeying the actions of external forces like any other matter, the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> in which we are just now interested does not at all depend on this notion of the nature of light. Should we, with Descartes or Huygens, suppose light to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> of an elastic medium, the conclusion will be the same. The undulations at certain distances are disturbed by forces directed towards the body, and at a greater distance, the disturbing forces tend from the body.\n\nBut the same alternations of attraction and repulsion may be observed between the particles of common matter. If we take a piece of very flat and well-polished glass, such as is made for the horizon glasses of a good Hadley's quadrant, and if we wrap round it a fibre of silk as it comes from the cocoon, taking care that the fibre nowhere crosses another, and then press this pretty hard on such another piece of glass, it will lift it up and keep it suspended. The particles therefore of the one do most certainly attract those of the other, and this at a distance equal to the thickness of the silk fibre. This is nearly the limit; and it sometimes requires a considerable pressure to produce the effect. The pressure is effectual only by compressing the silk fibre, and thus diminishing the distance between the glass plates. This adhesion cannot be attributed to the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, because there is nothing to hinder the air from infusing itself between the plates, since they are separated by the silk. Besides, the experiment succeeds equally well under the receiver of an air-pump. This most valuable experiment was first made by Huygens, who reported it to the Royal Society. It is narrated in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 86.\n\nHere then is an attraction acting, like gravity, at a distance. But take away the silk fibre, and try to make the glasses touch each other, and we shall find a very great force necessary. By Newton's experiments it appears, that unless the prismatic colours begin to appear between the glasses, they are at least \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch asunder or more. Now we know that a very considerable force is necessary for producing these colours, and that the more we press the glasses together the more rings of colours appear. It also appears from Newton's measures, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of distance between the glasses where each of these colours appear is about the \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch. We know farther, that when we have produced the last appearance of a grey or pearly colour, and then augment the pressure, making it about a thousand pounds on the square inch, all colours vanish, and the two pieces of glass seem to make one transparent undistinguishable mass. They appear now to have no air between them, or to be in mathematical contact. But another fact shows this conclusion to be premature. The same circles of colours appear in the top of a soap bubble; and as it grows thinner at top, there appears an unreflecting spot in the middle. We have the greatest probability therefore that the perfect transparency in the middle of the two glasses does not arise from their being in contact, but because the thickness of air between them is too small in that place for the reflection of light. Nay, Newton expressly found no reflection where the thickness was \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) or more of the \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch.\n\nAll this while the glasses are strongly repelling each other, for great pressure is necessary for continuing the appearance of these colours, and they vanish in succession as the pressure is diminished. This vanishing of the colours is a proof that the glasses are moving off from each other, or repelling each other. But we can put an end to this repulsion by very strong pressure, and at the same time sliding the glasses on each other. We do not pretend to account for this effect of the sliding motion; but the fact is, that by so doing, the glasses will cohere with very great force, so that we shall break them by any attempt to pull them asunder. It commonly happens (at least it did so with us), that in this sliding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two smooth flat plates of glass they scratch and mutually destroy each other's surface. It is also worth remarking, that different kinds of glasses exhibit different properties in this respect. Flint glasses will attract even though a silk fibre lies double between them, and they much more readily cohere by this sliding pressure.\n\nHere then are two distances at which the plates of glass attract each other; namely, when the silk fibre is interposed, and when they are forced together with this sliding motion. And in any intermediate situation they repel each other. We see the same thing in other solid bodies. Two pieces of lead made perfectly clean, may be made to cohere by grinding them together in the iron manner. It is in this way that pretty ornaments of silver are united to iron. The piece is scraped clean, and a small bit of silver like a fillet scale is laid on. The die which is to strike it into a flower or other ornament is then put on it, and we give it a smart blow, which forces the metals into contact as firm as if they were soldered together. It sometimes happens that the die adheres to the coin so that they cannot be separated; and it is found that this frequently happens, when the engraving is such, that the raised figure is not complete-\nStrength ofly surrounded with a smooth flat ground. The probable cause of this is curious. When the coin has a flat surface all around, this is produced by the most prominent part of the die. This applies to the metal, and completely confines the air which filled the hollow of the die. As the pressure goes on, the metal is squeezed up into the hollow of the die; but there is still air compressed between them, which cannot escape by any passage. It is therefore prodigiously condensed, and exerts an elasticity proportioned to the condensation. This serves to separate the die from the metal when the stroke is over. The hollow part of the die has not touched the metal all the while, and we may say that the impression was made by air. If this air escape by any engraving reaching through the border, they cohere inseparably.\n\nWe have admitted that the glass plates are in contact when they cohere thus firmly. But we are not certain of this: for if we take these cohering glasses, and touch them with water, it quickly infuses itself between them. Yet they still cohere, but can now be pretty easily separated.\n\nIt is owing to this repulsion, exerted through its proper sphere, that certain powders swim on the surface of water, and are wetted with great difficulty. Certain insects can run about on the surface of water. They have bristly feet, which occupy a considerable surface; and if their steps are viewed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> glass, the surface of the water is seen depressed all around, resembling the footsteps of a man walking on sea-herds. This is owing to a repulsion between the brush and the water. A common fly cannot walk in this manner on water. Its feet are wetted, because they attract the water instead of repelling it. A steel needle, wiped very clean, will lie on the surface of water, making an impression as a great bar would make on a feather bed; and its weight is less than that of the displaced water.\n\nA dew drop lies on the leaves of plants without touching them mathematically, as is plain from the extreme brilliancy of the reflection at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> surface; nay, it may be sometimes observed that the drops of rain lie on the surface of water, and roll about on it like balls on a table. Yet all these substances can be wetted; that is, water can be applied to them at such distances that they attract it.\n\nWhat we said a little ago of water infusing itself between the glass plates without altogether destroying their cohesion, shows that this cohesion is not the same that obtains between the particles of one of the plates; that is, the two plates are not in the state of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> mass. It is highly probable, therefore, that between these two states there is an intermediate state of repulsion; nay, perhaps many such, alternated with attractive states.\n\nA piece of ice is elastic, for it rebounds and rings. Its particles, therefore, when compressed, resist; and when stretched, contract again. The particles are therefore in the state represented by B in figure 1, acted on by repulsive forces, if brought nearer; and by attractive forces, if drawn further asunder. Ice expands, like all other bodies, by heat. It absorbs a vast quantity of fire; which, by combining its attractions and repulsions with those of the particles of ice, changes completely the law of action, without making any sensible change in the distance of the particles, and the ice becomes watery. In this new state the particles are again in limits strength of between attractive and repulsive forces; for water has been shown, by the experiments of Canton and Zimmerman, to be elastic or compressible. It again expands by heat. It again absorbs a prodigious quantity of heat, and becomes elastic vapour; its particles repelling each other at all distances yet observed. The distance between the particles of one plate of glass and those of another which lies on it, and is carried by it, is a distance of repulsion; for the force which supports the upper piece is acting in opposition to its weight. This distance is less than that at which it would suspend it below it with a silk fibre interposed; for no prismatic colours appear between them when the silk fibre is interposed. But the distance at which glass attracts water is much less than this, for no colours appear when glass is wetted with water. This distance is less, and not greater, than the other; for when the glasses have water interposed between them instead of air, it is found, that when any particular colour appears, the thickness of the plate of water is to that of the plate of air which would produce the same colour nearly as 3 to 4. Now, if a piece of glass be wetted, and exhibit no colour, and another piece of glass be simply laid on it, no colour will appear; but if they are strongly pressed, the colours appear in the same manner as if the glasses had air between. Also, when glass is simply wetted, and the film of water is allowed to evaporate, when it is thus reduced to a proper thinness, the colours show themselves in great beauty.\n\nThere are a few of many thousand facts, by which it is unquestionably proved that the particles of tangible matter are connected by forces acting at a distance, varying by forces with the distance, and alternately attractive and repelling at a repulsive. If we represent these forces as we have already done in fig. 1, by the ordinates C c, D d, E e, F f, &c., of a curve, it is evident that this curve must cross the axis at all those distances where the forces change from attractive to repulsive, and the curve must have branches alternately above and below the axis.\n\nAll these alternations of attraction and repulsion take place at small and insensible distances. At all sensible distances the particles are influenced by the attraction of gravitation; and therefore this part of the curve must be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a> whose equation is \\( y = \\frac{a^3}{x^2} \\). What is the form of the curve corresponding to the smallest distance of the particles? that is, what is the mutual action between the particles just before their coming into absolute contact? Analogy should lead us to suppose it to be repulsion: for solidity is the last simplest form of bodies with which we are acquainted.\u2014Fluids are more compounded, containing fire as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> ingredient. We should conclude that this ultimate repulsion is insuperable, for the hardest bodies are the most elastic. We are fully entitled to say, that this repelling force exceeds all that we have ever yet applied to overcome it; nay, there are good reasons for saying that this ultimate repulsion, by which the particles are kept from mathematical contact, is really insuperable in its own nature, and that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to produce mathematical contact.\n\nWe shall just mention one of these, which we consider as unanswerable. Suppose two atoms, or ultimate particles of matter A and B. Let A be at rest, and B move.\nStrength of move up to it with the velocity 2; and let us suppose that it comes into mathematical contact, and impels it (according to the common acceptation of the word). Both move with the velocity 1. This is granted by all to be the final result of the collision. Now the instant of time in which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> happens is no part either of the duration of the solitary motion of A, nor of the joint motion of A and B: It is the separation or boundary between them. It is at once the end of the first, and the beginning of the second, belonging equally to both. A was moving with the velocity 2. The distinguishing circumstance therefore of its mechanical state is, that it has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> (however incomprehensible) by which it would move for ever with the velocity 2, if nothing changed it. This it has during the whole of its solitary motion, and therefore in the last instant of this motion. In like manner, during the whole of the joint motion, and therefore in the first instant of this motion, the atom A has a determination by which it would move for ever with the velocity 1. In one and the same instant, therefore, the atom A has two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> determinations. Whatever notion we can form of this state, which we call velocity, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of condition, the same impossibility of conception or the same absurdity occurs. Nor can it be avoided in any other way than by saying, that this change of A's motion is brought about by insensible gradations; that is, that A and B influence each other precisely as they would do if a slender spring were interposed. The reader is desired to look at what we have said in the article Physics, \u00a7 82.\n\nThe two magnets there spoken of are good representatives of two atoms endowed with mutual powers of repulsion; and the communication of motion is accomplished in both cases in precisely the same manner.\n\nIf, therefore, we shall ever be so fortunate as to discover the law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of that force which connects one atom of matter with another atom, and which is therefore characteristic of matter, and the ultimate source of all its sensible qualities, the curve whose ordinates represent the kind and the intensity of this atomic force will be something like that sketched in fig. 2. The first branch a n B will have AK (perpendicular to the axis AH) for its asymptote, and the last branch l m o will be to all senses a hyperbola, having AO for its asymptote; and the ordinates l L, m M, &c. will be proportional to $\\frac{1}{AL^2}$, $\\frac{1}{AM^2}$, &c., expressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> gravitation of matter. It will have many branches B b C, D d E, F f G, &c., expressing attractions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> repulsive branches C c D, E e F, G g H, &c. All these will be contained within a distance AH, which does not exceed a very minute fraction of an inch.\n\nThe simplest particle which can be a constituent of a body having length, breadth, and thickness, must consist of four such atoms, all of which combine their influence on each atom of another such particle. It is evident that the curve which expresses the forces that connect two such particles must be totally different from this original curve, this hylarchic principle. Supposing the last known, our mathematical knowledge is quite able to discover the first; but when we proceed to compose a body of particles, each of which consists of four such particles, we may venture to say, that the compound force which connects them is almost beyond our reach, and that the discovery of the primary force from an accurate knowledge of the corporeal forces of this particular matter is absolutely out of our power.\n\nAll that we can learn is, the possibility, nay the certainty, of an innumerable variety of external sensible forms and qualities, by which different kinds of matter will be distinguished, arising from the number, the order of composition, and the arrangement of the subordinate particles of which a particle of this or that kind of matter is composed. All these varieties will take place at those small and insensible distances which are between A and H, and may produce all that variety which we observe in the tangible or mechanical forms of bodies, such as elasticity, ductility, hardness, softness, fluidity, vapour, and all those unseen motions or actions which we observe in fusion and congelation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> and condensation, solution and precipitation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, vegetable and animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a> and secretion, &c. &c. While all bodies must be, in a certain degree, elastic, all must gravitate, and all must be incompensable.\n\nThis general and satisfactory resemblance between the appearance of tangible matter and the legitimate consequence of this general hypothetical property of an atom of matter, affords a considerable probability that such is the origin of all the phenomena. We earnestly recommend to our readers a careful perusal of Bolcovich's celebrated treatise. A careful perusal is necessary for seeing its value; and nothing will be got by a hasty look at it. The reader will be particularly pleased with the facility and evidence with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author has deduced all the ordinary principles of mechanics, and with the explanation which he has given of fluidity, and his deduction from thence of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>. No part of the treatise is more valuable than the doctrine of the propagation of pressure through solid bodies. This, however, is but just touched on in the course of the investigation of the principles of mechanics. We shall borrow as much as will suffice for our present inquiry into the strength of materials; and we trust that our readers are not displeased with this general sketch of the doctrine (if it may be so called) of the cohesion of bodies. It is curious and important in itself, and is the foundation of all the knowledge we can acquire of the true nature of cohesion yet a new subject of study; but it is a very promising one, and we by no means despair of seeing the whole of chemistry brought by its means within the pale of mechanical science. The great and distinguishing agent in chemistry is heat, or fire the cause of heat; and one of its most singular effects is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of bodies into elastic vapour. We have the clearest evidence that this is brought about by mechanical forces: for it can be opposed or prevented by external pressure, a very familiar mechanical force. We may perhaps find another mechanical force which will prevent fusion.\n\nHaving now made our readers familiar with the mode of action in which cohesion operates in giving strength to solid bodies, we proceed to consider the strains to which this strength is opposed.\n\nA piece of solid matter is exposed to four kinds of strains, pretty different in the manner of their operation, which 1. It may be torn asunder, as in the case of ropes, stretchers, king-posts, tie-beams, &c.\n2. It may be crushed, as in the case of pillars, posts, and truss beams.\n\n3. It may be broken across, as happens to a joist or lever of any kind.\n\n4. It may be wrenched or twisted, as in the case of the axle of a wheel, the nail of a press, &c.\n\nI. IT MAY BE PULLED ASUNDER.\n\nThis is the simplest of all strains, and the others are indeed modifications of it. To this the force of cohesion is directly opposed, with very little modification of its action by any particular circumstances.\n\nWhen a long cylindrical or prismatic body, such as a rod of wood or metal, or a rope, is drawn by one end, it must be resisted at the other, in order to bring its cohesion into action. When it is fastened at one end, we cannot conceive it any other way than as equally stretched in all its parts; for all our observations and experiments on natural bodies concur in showing us that the forces which connect their particles, in any way whatever, are equal and opposite. This is called the third law of motion; and we admit its universality, while we affirm that it is purely experimental (see Physics). Yet we have met with dissertations by persons of eminent knowledge, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> are maintained inconfutably with this. During the dispute about the communication of motion, some of the ablest writers have said, that a spring compressed or stretched at the two ends was gradually less and less compressed or stretched from the extremities towards the middle; but the same writers acknowledged the universal equality of action and reaction, which is quite incompatible with this state of the spring. No such inequality of compression or dilatation has ever been observed; and a little reflection will show it to be impossible, in consistency with the equality of action and reaction.\n\nSince all parts are thus equally stretched, it follows, that the strain in any transverse section is the same, as also in every point of that section. If therefore the body be supposed of a homogeneous texture, the cohesion of the parts is equable; and since every part is equally stretched, the particles are drawn to equal distances from their quietest positions, and the forces which are thus excited, and now exerted in opposition to the straining force, are equal. This external force may be increased by degrees, which will gradually separate the parts of the body more and more from each other, and the connecting forces increase with this increase of distance, till at last the cohesion of some particles is overcome. This must be immediately followed by a rupture, because the remaining forces are now weaker than before.\n\nIt is the united force of cohesion, immediately before the division of the first particles, that we call the STRENGTH of the section. It may also be properly called its ABSOLUTE STRENGTH, being exerted in the simplest form, and not modified by any relation to other circumstances.\n\nIf the external force has not produced any permanent change on the body, and it therefore recovers its former dimensions when the force is withdrawn, it is plain that this strain may be repeated as often as we please, and the body which withstands it once will always withstand it. It is evident that this should be attended to in all constructions, and that in all our investigations on this subject this should be kept strictly in view. When we treat Materials, a piece of soft clay in this manner, and with this precaution, the force employed must be very small. If we exceed this, we produce a permanent change. The rod of clay is not indeed torn asunder; but it has become somewhat more slender; the number of particles in a cross section is now smaller; and therefore, although it will again, in this new form, suffer, or allow an endless repetition of a certain strain without any farther permanent change, this strain is smaller than the former.\n\nSomething of the same kind happens in all bodies which receive a set by the strain to which they are exposed. All ductile bodies are of this kind. But there are many bodies which are not ductile. Such bodies break completely whenever they are stretched beyond the limit of their perfect elasticity. Bodies of a fibrous structure exhibit very great varieties in their cohesion. In some the fibres have no lateral cohesion, as in the case of a rope. The only way in which all the fibres can be made to unite their strength is, to twist them together. This causes them to bind each other so fast, that any one of them will break before it can be drawn out of the bundle. In other fibrous bodies, such as timber, the fibres are held together by some cement or gluten. This is seldom as strong as the fibre. Accordingly timber is much easier pulled asunder in a direction transverse to the fibres. There is, however, every possible variety in this particular.\n\nIn stretching and breaking fibrous bodies, the visible extension is frequently very considerable. This is not solely the increasing of the distance of the particles of the cohering fibre: the greatest part chiefly arises from drawing the crooked fibre straight. In this, too, there is great diversity; and it is accompanied with important differences in their power of withstanding a strain. In some woods, such as fir, the fibres on which the strength most depends are very straight. Such woods are commonly very elastic, do not take a set, and break abruptly when overstrained: others, such as oak and birch, have their resisting fibres very undulating and crooked, and stretch very sensibly by a strain. They are very liable to take a set, and they do not break so suddenly, but give warning by complaining, as the carpenters call it; that is, by giving visible signs of a derangement of texture. Hard bodies of an uniform glairy structure, or granulated like stones, are elastic through the whole extent of their cohesion, and take no set, but break at once when overloaded.\n\nNotwithstanding the immense variety which nature exhibits in the structure and cohesion of bodies, there are certain general facts of which we may now avail ourselves with advantage. In particular,\n\nThe absolute cohesion is proportional to the area of the section. This must be the case where the texture is perfectly uniform, as we have reason to think it is in strength glials and the ductile metals. The cohesion of each proportionate particle being alike, the whole cohesion must be proportional to the number, that is, to the area of the section. The same must be admitted with respect to bodies of a granulated texture, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANULATION\">granulation</a> is regular and uniform. The same must be admitted of fibrous bodies, if we suppose their fibres equally strong, equally force.\nStrength of dense, and similarly disposed through the whole section; and this we must either suppose, or must state the diversity, and measure the cohesion accordingly.\n\nWe may therefore assert, as a general proposition on this subject, that the absolute strength in any part of a body by which it resists being pulled asunder, or the force which must be employed to tear it asunder in that part, is proportional to the area of the section perpendicular to the extending force.\n\nTherefore all cylindrical or prismatic rods are equally strong in every part, and will break alike in any part; and bodies which have unequal sections will always break in the slenderest part. The length of the cylinder or prism has no effect on the strength; and the vulgar notion, that it is easier to break a very long rope than a short one, is a very great mistake. Also the absolute strengths of bodies which have similar sections are proportional to the squares of their diameters or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOLOGOUS\">homologous</a> sides of the section.\n\nThe weight of the body itself may be employed to strain it and to break it. It is evident, that a rope may be so long as to break by its own weight. When the rope is hanging perpendicularly, although it is equally strong in every part, it will break towards the upper end, because the strain on any part is the weight of all that is below it. Its relative strength in any part, or power of withstanding the strain which is actually laid on it, is inversely as the quantity below that part.\n\nWhen the rope is stretched horizontally, as in towing a ship, the strain arising from its weight often bears a very sensible proportion to its whole strength.\n\nLet AEB (fig. 3.) be any portion of such a rope, and AC, BC be tangents to the curve into which its gravity bends it. Complete the parallelogram ACBD. It is well known that the curve is a catenary, and that DC is perpendicular to the horizon; and that DC is to AC as the weight of the rope AEB to the strain at A.\n\nIn order that a suspended heavy body may be equally able in every part to carry its own weight, the section in that part must be proportional to the solid contents of all that is below it. Suppose it a conoidal spindle, formed by the revolution of the curve Aae (fig. 4.) round the axis CE. We must have AC\u00b2 : ae\u00b2 = AEB fol. : aEb fol. This condition requires the logarithmic curve for Aae, of which Cc is the axis.\n\nThese are the chief general rules which can be safely deduced from our clearest notions of the cohesion of bodies. In order to make any practical use of them, it is proper to have some measures of the cohesion of such bodies as are commonly employed in our mechanics, and other structures where they are exposed to this kind of strain. These must be deduced solely from experiment. Therefore they must be considered as no more than general values, or as the averages of many particular trials. The irregularities are very great, because none of the substances are constant in their texture and firmness. Metals differ by a thousand circumstances unknown to us, according to their purity, to the heat with which they were melted, to the moulds in which they were cast, and the treatment they have afterwards received, by forging, wire-drawing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a>, &c.\n\nIt is a very curious and inexplicable fact, that by forging a metal, or by frequently drawing it through a smooth hole in a steel plate, its cohesion is greatly increased. This operation undoubtedly deranges the natural situation of the particles. They are squeezed closer together in one direction; but it is not in the direction in which they resist the fracture. In this direction they are rather separated to a greater distance. The general density, however, is augmented in all of them except lead, which grows rather rarer by wire-drawing; but its cohesion may be more than tripled by this operation. Gold, silver, and brass, have their cohesion nearly tripled; copper and iron have it more than doubled. In this operation they also grow much harder. It is proper to heat them to redness after drawing a little. This is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANNEALING\">annealing</a>. It softens the metal again, and renders it susceptible of another drawing without the risk of cracking in the operation.\n\nWe do not pretend to give any explanation of this remarkable and very important fact, which has something resembling it in woods and other fibrous bodies, as will be mentioned afterwards.\n\nThe varieties in the cohesion of stones and other minerals, and of vegetable and animal substances, are hardly susceptible of any description or classification.\n\nWe shall take for the measure of cohesion the number of pounds avoirdupois which are just sufficient to tear and asunder a rod or bundle of one inch square. From this it will be easy to compute the strength corresponding to metals of any other dimension.\n\n| Metals | lbs |\n|--------|-----|\n| Gold, cast | 20,000 |\n| Silver, cast | 24,000 |\n| Copper, cast | 43,000 |\n| Japan | 19,500 |\n| Barbary | 22,000 |\n| Hungary | 31,000 |\n| Anglesea | 34,000 |\n| Sweden | 37,000 |\n| Iron, cast | 42,000 |\n| Iron, bar | 59,000 |\n| Ordinary | 68,000 |\n| Stirian | 75,000 |\n| B.c.f Swedish and Russian | 84,000 |\n| Horse-nails | 71,000 |\n| Steel, bar | 120,000 |\n| Razor temper | 150,000 |\n| Malacca | 3,100 |\n| Banca | 3,600 |\n| Block | 3,800 |\n| English block | 5,200 |\n| Lead, cast | 6,500 |\n| Regulus of antimony | 860 |\n| Zinc | 1,000 |\n| Bismuth | 2,600 |\n\n(A) This was an experiment by Mulchenbroek, to examine the vulgar notion that iron forged from old horse nails was stronger than all others, and shows its fallacy.\nIt is very remarkable that almost all the mixtures of metals are more tenacious than the metals themselves. The change of tenacity depends much on the proportion of the ingredients, and the proportion which produces the most tenacious mixture is different in the different metals. We have selected the following from the experiments of Mulchenbroek. The proportion of ingredients here selected is that which produces the greatest strength.\n\nTwo parts of gold with one of silver - 28,000\nFive parts of gold with one of copper - 50,000\nFive parts of silver with one of copper - 48,300\nFour parts of silver with one of tin - 41,000\nSix parts of copper with one of tin - 41,000\nFive parts of Japan copper with one of Banca tin - 57,000\nSix parts of Chili copper with one of Malacca tin - 60,000\nSix parts of Swedish copper with one of Malacca tin - 64,000\nBrass consists of copper and zinc in an unknown proportion; its strength is 51,000\nThree parts of block tin with one part of lead - 10,200\nEight parts of block tin with one part of zinc - 10,000\nFour parts of Malacca tin with one part of regulus of antimony - 12,000\nEight parts of lead with one of zinc - 4,500\nFour parts of tin with one of lead and one of zinc - 13,000\n\nThese numbers are of considerable use in the arts. The mixtures of copper and tin are particularly interesting in the fabric of great guns. We see that, by mixing copper whose greatest strength does not exceed 37,000, with tin which does not exceed 6000, we produce a metal whose tenacity is almost double, at the same time that it is harder and more easily wrought. It is, however, more fusible, which is a great inconvenience. We also see that a very small addition of zinc almost doubles the tenacity of tin, and increases the tenacity of lead five times; and a small addition of lead doubles the tenacity of tin. These are economical mixtures. This is a very valuable information to the plumbers for augmenting the strength of water-pipes.\n\nBy having recourse to these tables, the engineer can proportion the thickness of his pipes (of whatever metal) to the pressures to which they are exposed.\n\n2d. Woods.\n\nWe may premise to this part of the table the following general observations.\n\n1. The wood immediately surrounding the pith or heart of the tree is the weakest, and its inferiority is so much more remarkable as the tree is older. In this affection, however, we speak with some hesitation. Mulchenbroek's detail of experiments is decidedly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>. Mr Buffon, on the other hand, says, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has taught him that the heart of a found tree is the strongest; but he gives no instances. We are certain, from many observations of our own, on very large oaks and firs, that the heart is much weaker than the exterior parts.\n\n2. The wood next the bark, commonly called the strength of white or blea, is also weaker than the rest; and the wood gradually increases in strength as we recede from the centre to the blea.\n\n3. The wood is stronger in the middle of the trunk than at the springing of the branches or at the root; and the wood of the branches is weaker than that of the trunk.\n\n4. The wood of the north side of all trees which grow in our European climates is the weakest; and that of the south-east side is the strongest; and the difference is most remarkable in hedge-row trees, and such as growing singly. The heart of a tree is never in its centre, but always nearer to the north side, and the annual coats of wood are thinner on that side. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with this, it is a general opinion of carpenters that timber is stronger whose annual plates are thicker. The trachea or air-vessels are weaker than the simple ligneous fibres. These air-vessels are the same in diameter and number of rows in trees of the same species, and they make the visible separation between the annual plates. Therefore when these are thicker, they contain a greater proportion of the simple ligneous fibres.\n\n5. All woods are more tenacious while green, and lose very considerably by drying after the trees are felled.\n\nThe only author who has put it in our power to judge of the propriety of his experiments is Mulchenbroek. He has described his method of trial minutely; and it seems unexceptionable. The woods were all formed into slips fit for his apparatus, and part of the slip was cut away to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of an inch square, and therefore \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of a square inch in section. The absolute strengths of a square inch were as follow:\n\n| Wood          | Strength |\n|---------------|----------|\n| Locust tree   | 20,100   |\n| Jujeb         | 18,500   |\n| Beech, oak    | 17,100   |\n| Orange        | 15,500   |\n| Alder         | 13,900   |\n| Elm           | 13,200   |\n| Mulberry      | 12,500   |\n| Willow        | 12,500   |\n| Ash           | 12,000   |\n| Plum          | 11,800   |\n| Elder         | 10,000   |\n| Pomegranate   | 9,750    |\n| Lemon         | 9,250    |\n| Tamarind      | 8,750    |\n| Fir           | 8,330    |\n| Walnut        | 8,130    |\n| Pitch pine    | 7,650    |\n| Quince        | 6,750    |\n| Cypress       | 6,000    |\n| Poplar        | 5,500    |\n| Cedar         | 4,880    |\n\nMr Mulchenbroek has given a very minute detail of the experiments on the ash and the walnut, stating the weights which were required to tear asunder slips taken from the four sides of the tree, and on each side, in a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a> from the centre to the circumference. The numbers of this table corresponding to these two timbers may therefore be considered as the average of more than 50 trials made of each; and he says that all the others were made with the same care. We cannot therefore see any reason for not confiding in the results; yet they are considerably higher than those given by some other writers. Mr Pitot says, on the authority of his own experiments, and of those of Mr Parent, that 60 pounds will just tear asunder a square line of sound oak, and that it will bear 50 with safety. This gives \u00a3640 for the utmost strength of a square inch, which is much inferior to Mulchenbroek's valuation.\n\nWe may add to these,\n\nIvory\nThe reader will surely observe, that these numbers express something more than the utmost cohesion; for the weights are such as will very quickly, that is, in a minute or two, tear the rods asunder. It may be said in general, that two-thirds of these weights will sensibly impair the strength after a considerable while, and that one-half is the utmost that can remain suspended at them without risk for ever; and it is this last allotment that the engineer should reckon upon in his constructions. There is, however, considerable difference in this respect. Woods of a very straight fibre, such as fir, will be less impaired by any load which is not sufficient to break them immediately.\n\nAccording to Mr Emerson, the load which may be safely suspended to an inch square is as follows:\n\n| Material                  | Load (lbs) |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| Iron                      | 76,400     |\n| Braids                    | 35,600     |\n| Hemp rope                 | 19,600     |\n| Ivory                     | 15,700     |\n| Oak, box, yew, plum-tree   | 7,850      |\n| Elm, ash, beech            | 6,070      |\n| Walnut, plum               | 5,360      |\n| Red fir, holly, elder, plane, crab | 5,000 |\n| Cherry, hazel              | 4,760      |\n| Alder, ash, birch, willow  | 4,290      |\n| Lead                      | 430        |\n| Freestone                 | 914        |\n\nHe gives us a practical rule, that a cylinder whose diameter is d inches, loaded to one-fourth of its absolute strength, will carry as follows:\n\n| Material                  | Load (lbs) |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| Iron                      | 135        |\n| Good rope                 | 22         |\n| Oak                       | 14         |\n| Fir                       | 9          |\n\nThe rank which the different woods hold in this list of Mr Emerson's is very different from what we find in Mutchtenbroek's. But precise measures must not be expected in this matter. It is wonderful that in a matter of such unquestionable importance the public has not enabled some persons of judgement to make proper trials. They are beyond the abilities of private persons.\n\nII. Bodies may be crushed.\n\nIt is of equal, perhaps greater, importance to know the strain which may be laid on solid bodies without danger of crushing them. Pillars and posts of all kinds are exposed to this strain in its simplest form; and there are cases where the strain is enormous, viz., where it arises from the oblique position of the parts; as in the flutes, braces, and trusses, which occur very frequently in our great works.\n\nIt is therefore most desirable to have some general knowledge of the principle which determines the strength of bodies in opposition to this kind of strain. But unfortunately we are much more at a loss in this than in the last case. The mechanism of nature is much more complicated in the present case. It must be in some curious way that compression can have any tendency to tear asunder the parts of a solid body, and it is very difficult to trace the steps.\n\nIf we suppose the particles insuperably hard and in contact, and disposed in lines which are in the direction of the external pressures, it does not appear how any pressure can disunite the particles; but this is a gratuitous supposition. There are infinite odds against this precise arrangement of the lines of particles; and the compressibility of all kinds of matter in some degree shows that the particles are in a situation equivalent to distance. This being the case, and the particles, with their intervals, or what is equivalent to intervals, being in situations that are oblique with respect to the pressures, it must follow, that by squeezing them together in one direction, they are made to bulge out or separate in other directions. This may proceed so far that some may be thus pushed laterally beyond their limits of cohesion. The moment that this happens the resistance to compression is diminished, and the body will now be crushed together. We may form some notion of this by supposing a number of spherules, like small shot, sticking together by means of a cement. Compressing this in some particular direction causes the spherules to act among each other like so many wedges, each tending to penetrate through between the three which lie below it: and this is the simplest, and perhaps the only distinct notion we can have of the matter. We have reason to think that the constitution of very homogeneous bodies, such as glass, is not very different from this. The particles are certainly arranged symmetrically in the angles of some regular solids. It is only such an arrangement that is consistent with transparency, and with the free passage of light in every direction.\n\nIf this be the constitution of bodies, it appears probable that the strength, or the resiliency which they are strength capable of making to an attempt to crush them to pieces, or power is proportional to the area of the section whose plane is of resistance perpendicular to the external force; for each particle being similarly and equally acted on and resisted, the whole force resiliency must be as their number; that is, as the extent of the section.\n\nAccordingly this principle is affirmed by the few writers who have considered this subject; but we confess that it appears to us very doubtful. Suppose a number of brittle or friable balls lying on a table uniformly arranged, but not cohering nor in contact, and that a board is laid over them and loaded with a weight; we have no hesitation in saying, that the weight necessary to crush the whole collection is proportional to their number or to the area of the section. But when they are in contact (and still more if they cohere), we imagine that the case is materially altered. Any individual ball is crushed only in consequence of its being bulged outwards in the direction perpendicular to the pressure employed. If this could be prevented by a hoop put round the ball like an equator, we cannot see how any force can crush it. Anything therefore which makes this bulging outwards more difficult, makes a greater force necessary. Now this effect will be produced by the mere contact of the balls before the pressure is applied; for the central ball cannot swell outward laterally without pushing away the balls on all sides of it. This is prevented by the friction on the table and upper board.\nStrength of board, which is at least equal to one third of the pref-\nMaterials. sure. Thus any interior ball becomes stronger by the\nmere vicinity of the others; and if we farther suppose\nthem to cohere laterally, we think that its strength will\nbe still more increased.\n\nThe analogy between these balls and the cohering\nparticles of a friable body is very perfect. We should\ntherefore expect that the strength by which it resists being\ncrushed will increase in a greater ratio than that of the\nsection, or the square of the diameter of similar sec-\ntions; and that a square inch of any matter will bear a\ngreater weight in proportion as it makes a part of a\ngreater section. Accordingly this appears in many ex-\nperiments, as will be noticed afterwards. Muthenbroek,\nEuler, and some others, have supposed the strength of\ncolumns to be as the biquadrates of their diameters.\nBut Euler deduced this from formulae which occurred\nto him in the course of his algebraic analysis; and he\nboldly adopts it as a principle, without looking for its\nfoundation in the physical assumptions which he had\nmade in the beginning of his investigation. But some\nof his original assumptions were as paradoxical, or at\nleast as gratuitous, as these results; and those, in par-\nticular, from which this proportion of the strength of col-\numns was deduced, were almost foreign to the case;\nand therefore the inference was of no value. Yet it was\nreceived as a principle by Muthenbroek and by the aca-\ndemicians of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PETERBURGH\">Peterburgh</a>. We make these very few\nobservations, because the subject is of great practical\nimportance; and it is a great obstacle to improvements\nwhen deference to a great name, joined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCAPACITY\">incapacity</a> or\nindolence, causes authors to adopt his careless reveries as\nprinciples from which they are afterwards to draw im-\nportant consequences. It must be acknowledged that\nwe have not as yet established the relation between the\ndimensions and the strength of a pillar on solid mechan-\nical principles. Experience plainly contradicts the gen-\neral opinion, that the strength is proportional to the\narea of the section; but it is still more inconsistent with\nthe opinion, that it is in the quadruplicate ratio of the\ndiameters of similar sections. It would seem that the\nratio depends much on the internal structure of the bo-\ndy; and experiment seems the only method for ascer-\ntaining its general laws.\n\nIf we suppose the body to be of a fibrous texture,\nhaving the fibres situated in the direction of the pressure,\nand slightly adhering to each other by some kind of ce-\nment, such a body will fail only by the bending of the\nfibres, by which they will break the cement and be de-\ntached from each other. Something like this may be\nsupposed in wooden pillars. In such cases, too it would\nappear that the resistance must be as the number of equal-\nly resisting fibres, and as their mutual support, jointly;\nand, therefore, as some function of the area of the sec-\ntion. The same thing must happen if the fibres are na-\nturally crooked or undulated, as is observed in many\nwoods, &c., provided we suppose some similarity in their\nform. Similarity of some kind must always be supposed,\notherwise we need never aim at any general inferences.\n\nIn all cases therefore we can hardly refuse admitting\nthat the strength in opposition to compression is propor-\ntional to a function of the area of the section.\n\nAs the whole length of a cylinder or prism is equally\nprefixed, it does not appear that the strength of a pillar\nis at all affected by its length. If indeed it be supposed\nto bend under the pressure, the case is greatly changed,\nbecause it is then exposed to a transverse strain; and this\nincreases with the length of the pillar. But this will\nbe considered with due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> under the next clas-\nof strains.\n\nFew experiments have been made on this species of\nstrength and strain. Mr Petit says, that his experiments\nand those of Mr Parent, show that the force necessary for\ncrushing a body is nearly equal to that which will tear it\nasunder. He says that it requires something more than\n60 pounds on every square line to crush a piece of sound\noak. But the rule is by no means general; Glaes, for\ninstance, will carry a hundred times as much as oak in\nthis way, that is, resisting it; but will not suspend\nabove four or five times as much. Oak will suspend a\ngreat deal more than fir; but fir will carry twice as\nmuch as a pillar. Woods of a soft texture, although\nconsisting of very tenacious fibres, are more easily crushed\nby their load. This softness of texture is chiefly owing\nto their fibres not being straight but undulated, and\nthere being considerable vacuities between them, so that\nthey are easily bent laterally and crushed. When a post\nis overstrained by its load, it is observed to swell sensibly\nin diameter. Increasing the load causes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a>\ncracks or shivers to appear, and it presently after gives\nway. This is called crippling.\n\nIn all cases where the fibres lie oblique to the strain\nthe strength is greatly diminished, because the parts can\nthen be made to slide on each other, when the cohesion\nof the cementing matter is overcome.\n\nMuthenbroek has given some experiments on this\nsubject; but they are cases of long pillars, and therefore\ndo not belong to this place. They will be considered\nafterwards.\n\nThe only experiments of which we have seen any de-\ntail (and it is useless to insert mere assertions) are those\nof Mr Gauthey, in the 4th volume of Rozier's Journal\nde Physique. This engineer exposed to great pressures\nsmall rectangular parallelepipeds, cut from a great va-\nriety of stones, and noted the weights which crushed\nthem. The following table exhibits the medium results\nof many trials on two very uniform kinds of freestone,\none of them among the hardest and the other among the\nsoftest used in building.\n\n| Column 1st expresses the length AB of the section in French lines or 12ths of an inch; column 2nd expresses the breadth BC; column 3rd is the area of the section this pur-\npose made required to crush the piece; column 5th is the weight which was then borne by each square line of the sec-\ntion; and column 6th is the round numbers to which Mr Gauthey imagines that those in column 5th approximate.\n\n### Hard Stone\n\n| AB | BC | AB \u00d7 BC | Weight | Force |\n|----|----|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1  | 8  | 8       | 64     | 736   | 11.5  |\n| 2  | 8  | 12      | 96     | 2625  | 27.3  |\n| 3  | 8  | 16      | 128    | 4496  | 35.1  |\n\n### Soft Stone\n\n| 4  | 9  | 16      | 144    | 560   | 3.9   |\n| 5  | 9  | 18      | 162    | 848   | 5.3   |\n| 6  | 18 | 18      | 324    | 29.8  | 9     |\n| 7  | 18 | 24      | 432    | 5296  | 12.2  |\nLittle can be deduced from these experiments: The 1st and 3rd, compared with the 5th and 6th, should furnish similar results; for the 1st and 5th are respectively half of the 3rd and 6th; but the 3rd is three times stronger (that is, a line of the 3rd) than the first, whereas the 6th is only twice as strong as the 5th.\n\nIt is evident, however, that the strength increases much faster than the area of the section, and that a square line can carry more and more weight, according as it makes a part of a larger and larger section. In the series of experiments on the soft stone, the individual strength of a square line seems to increase nearly in the proportion of the section of which it makes a part.\n\nMr Gauthey deduces, from the whole of his numerous experiments, that a pillar of hard stone of Givry, whose section is a square foot, will bear with perfect safety 664,000 pounds, and that its extreme strength is 871,000, and the smallest strength observed in any of his experiments was 460,000. The soft bed of Givry stone had for its smallest strength 187,000, for its greatest 311,000, and for its safe load 249,000. Good brick will carry with safety 320,000; chalk will carry only 9000. The boldest piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> in this respect which he has seen is a pillar in the church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALL_SAINTS\">All-Saints</a> at Angers. It is 24 feet long and 11 inches square, and is loaded with 60,000, which is not one-seventh of what is necessary for crushing it.\n\nWe may observe here by the way, that Mr Gauthey's measure of the suspending strength of stone is vastly small in proportion to its power of supporting a load laid above it. He finds that a prism of the hard bed of Givry, of a foot section, is torn asunder by 4600 pounds; and if it be firmly fixed horizontally in a wall, it will be broken by a weight of 56,000 suspended a foot from the wall. If it rest on two props at a foot distance, it will be broken by 206,000 laid on its middle. These experiments agree so well with each other, that little use can be made of them. The subject is of great importance, and well deserves the attention of the patriotic philosopher.\n\nA set of good experiments would be very valuable, because it is against this kind of strain that we must guard by judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> in the most delicate and difficult problems which come through the hands of the civil and military engineer. The construction of stone arches, and the construction of great wooden bridges, and particularly the construction of the frames of carpentry called centres in the erection of stone bridges, are the most difficult jobs that occur. In the centres on which the arches of the bridge of Orleans were built some of the pieces of oak were carrying upwards of two tons on every square inch of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANTLING\">scantling</a>. All who saw it said that it was not able to carry the fourth part of the intended load. But the engineer understood the principles of his art, and ran the risk; and the result completely justified his confidence; for the centre did not complain in any part, only it was found too supple; so that it went out of shape while the haunches only of the arch were laid on it. The engineer corrected this by loading it at the crown, and thus kept it completely in shape during the progress of the work.\n\nIn the Memoirs (old) of the Academy of Peterburgh for 1778, there is a dissertation by Euler on this subject, but particularly limited to the strain on columns, in which the bending is taken into the account. Mr Fuss has treated the same subject with relation to carpentry in a subsequent volume. But there is little in these papers besides a dry mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>, proceeding on assumptions which (to speak favourably) are extremely gratuitous. The most important consequence of the compression is wholly overlooked, as we shall presently see. Our knowledge of the mechanism of cohesion is as yet far too imperfect to entitle us to a confident application of mathematics. Experiments should be multiplied.\n\nThe only way we can hope to make these experiments useful is to pay a careful attention to the manner in which the fracture is produced. By discovering the general resemblances in this particular, we advance a step in our power of introducing mathematical measurement. Thus, when a cubical piece of chalk is slowly crushed between the chaps of a vice, we see it uniformly split in a surface oblique to the pressure, and the two parts then slide along the surface of fracture. This should lead us to examine mathematically what relation there is between this surface of fracture and the necessary force; then we should endeavour to determine experimentally the position of this surface. Having discovered some general law or resemblance in this circumstance, we should try what mathematical hypothesis will agree with this. Having found one, we may then apply our simplest notions of cohesion, and compare the result of our computations with experiment. We are authorized to say, that a series of experiments have been made in this way, and that their results have been very uniform, and therefore satisfactory, and that they will soon be laid before the public as the foundations of successful practice in the construction of arches.\n\nIII. A BODY MAY BE BROKEN ACROSS.\n\nThe most usual, and the greatest strain, to which materials are exposed, is that which tends to break them to pieces transversely. It is seldom, however, that this is done in what strain a manner perfectly simple; for when a beam projects and breaks horizontally from a wall, and a weight is suspended from a body its extremity, the beam is commonly broken near the transverse wall, and the intermediate part has performed the functions of a lever. It sometimes, though rarely, happens that the pin in the joint of a pair of pincers or scissors is cut through by the strain; and this is almost the only case of a simple transverse fracture. Being so rare, we may content ourselves with saying, that in this case the strength of the piece is proportional to the area of the section.\n\nExperiments were made for discovering the resistances made by bodies to this kind of strain in the following manner: Two iron bars were disposed horizontally at an inch distance; a third hung perpendicularly between them, being supported by a pin made of the substance to be examined. This pin was made of a prismatic form, so as to fit exactly the holes in the three bars, which were made very exact, and of the same size and shape. A scale was suspended at the lower end of the perpendicular bar, and loaded till it tore out that part of the pin which filled the middle hole. This weight was evidently the measure of the lateral cohesion of two sections. The side-bars were made to grasp the middle bar pretty strongly between them, that there might be no distance imposed between the opposite pressures. This would have combined the energy of a lever with the purely transverse pressure. For the same reason it was neces-\nStrength of any that the internal parts of the holes should be no smaller than the edges. Great irregularities occurred in our first experiments from this cause, because the pins were somewhat tighter within than at the edges; but when this was corrected they were extremely regular.\n\nWe employed three sets of holes, viz. a circle, a square (which was occasionally made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> whose length was twice its breadth), and an equilateral triangle. We found in all our experiments the strength exactly proportional to the area of the section, and quite independent of its figure or position, and we found it considerably above the direct cohesion; that is, it took considerably more than twice the force to tear out this middle piece than to tear the pin asunder by a direct pull. A piece of fine freestone required 205 pounds to pull it directly asunder, and 575 to break it in this way. The difference was very constant in any one substance, but varied from four-thirds to six-thirds in different kinds of matter, being smallest in bodies of a fibrous texture. But indeed we could not make the trial on any bodies of considerable cohesion, because they required such forces as our apparatus could not support. Chalk, clay baked in the sun, baked sugar, brick, and freestone, were the strongest that we could examine.\n\nBut the more common case, where the energy of a lever intervenes, demands a minute examination.\n\nLet DABC (fig. 5) be a vertical section of a prismatic solid (that is, of equal size throughout), projecting horizontally from a wall in which it is firmly fixed; and let a weight P be hung on it at B, or let any power P act at B in a direction perpendicular to AB. Suppose the body of insuperable strength in every part except in the vertical section DA, perpendicular to its length. It must break in this section only. Let the cohesion be uniform over the whole of this section; that is, let each of the adjoining particles of the two parts cohere with an equal force f.\n\nThere are two ways in which it may break. The part ABCD may simply slide down along the surface of fracture, provided that the power acting at B is equal to the accumulated force which is exerted by every particle of the section in the direction AD.\n\nBut suppose this effectually prevented by something that supports the point A. The action at P tends to make the body turn round A (or round a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line passing through A at right angles to AB) as round a joint. This it cannot do without separating at the line DA. In this case the adjoining particles at D or E will be separated horizontally. But their cohesion resists this separation. In order, therefore, that the fracture may happen, the energy or momentum of the power P, acting by means of the lever AB, must be superior to the accumulated energies of the particles. The energy of each depends not only on its cohesive force, but also on its situation; for the supposed insuperable firmness of the rest of the body makes it a lever turning round the fulcrum A, and the cohesion of each particle, such as D or E, acts by means of the arm DA or EA. The energy of each particle will therefore be had by multiplying the force exerted by it in the instant of fracture by the arm of the lever by which it acts.\n\nLet us therefore first suppose, that in the instant of fracture every particle is exerting an equal force f. The energy of D will be $f \\times DA$, and that of E will be $f \\times EA$, and that of the whole will be the sum of all these products. Let the depth DA of the section be called d, and let any undetermined part of it EA be called x, and Materials. then the space occupied by any particle will be $x$. The cohesion of this space may be represented by $f \\times x$, and that of the whole by $f \\times d$. The energy by which each element $x$ of the line DA, or $d$, resists the fracture, will be $f \\times x$, and the whole accumulated energies will be $f \\times \\int x^2 dx$. This we know to be $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3$, or $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$. It is the same therefore as if the cohesion $f \\times d$ of the whole section had been acting at the point G, which is the middle of DA.\n\nThe reader who is not familiarly acquainted with this fluxionary calculus may arrive at the same conclusion in another way. Suppose the beam, instead of projecting horizontally from a wall, to be hanging from the ceiling, in which it is firmly fixed. Let us consider how the equal cohesion of every part operates in hindering the lower part from separating from the upper by opening round the joint A. The equal cohesion operates just as equal gravity would do, but in the opposite direction. Now we know, by the most elementary mechanics, that the effect of this will be the same as if the whole weight were concentrated in the centre of gravity G of the line DA, and that this point G is in the middle of DA. Now the number of fibres being as the length $d$ of the line, and the cohesion of each fibre being $=f$, the cohesion of the whole line is $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3$ or $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$.\n\nThe accumulated energy therefore of the cohesion in the instant of fracture is $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$. Now this must be equal or just inferior to the energy of the power employed to break it. Let the length AB be called l; then $P \\times l$ is the corresponding energy of the power. This gives us $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3 = p \\times l$ for the equation of equilibrium corresponding to the vertical section ADCB.\n\nSuppose now that the fracture is not permitted at DA, but at another section $a$ more remote from B. The body being prismatic, all the vertical sections are equal; and therefore $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$ is the same as before. But the energy of the power is by this means increased, being now $= P \\times B \\times a$, instead of $P \\times BA$: Hence we see that when the prismatic body is not insuperably strong in all its parts, but equally strong throughout, it must break close at the wall, where the strain or energy of the power is greatest. We see, too, that a power which is just able to break it at the wall is unable to break it anywhere else; also an absolute cohesion $f \\times d$, which can withstand the power $p$ in the section DA, will not withstand it in the section $a$, and will withstand more in the section $d'$.\n\nThis teaches us to distinguish between absolute and relative strength. The relative strength of a section has a reference to the strain actually exerted on that section. This relative strength is properly measured by the power which is just able to balance or overcome it, when applied at its proper place. Now since we had $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3 = p \\times l$, we have $p = \\frac{f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3}{l}$ for the measure of the strength of the section of the section DA, in relation to the power applied at B.\n\nIf the solid is a rectangular beam, whose breadth is b, it is plain that all the vertical sections are equal, and that AG or $\\frac{1}{3} d$ is the same in all. Therefore the equa-\nStrength often expressing the equilibrium between the momentum of the external force and the accumulated momenta of cohesion will be \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\).\n\nThe product \\( db \\) evidently expresses the area of the section of fracture, which we may call \\( s \\), and we may express the equilibrium thus, \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\), and \\( 2l : d = fs : p \\).\n\nNow \\( fs \\) is a proper expression of the absolute cohesion of the section of fracture, and \\( p \\) is a proper measure of its strength in relation to a power applied at B. We may therefore say, that twice the length of a rectangular beam is to the depth as the absolute cohesion to the relative strength.\n\nSince the action of equable cohesion is similar to the action of equal gravity, it follows, that whatever is the figure of the section, the relative strength will be the same as if the absolute cohesion of all the fibres were acting at the centre of gravity of the section. Let \\( g \\) be the distance between the centre of gravity of the section and the axis of fracture, we shall have \\( p = fsg \\), and \\( l : g = fs : p \\). It will be very useful to recollect this analogy in words: \"The length of a prismatic beam of any shape is to the height of the centre of gravity above the lower side, as the absolute cohesion to the strength relative to this length.\"\n\nBecause the relative strength of a rectangular beam is \\( \\frac{fb}{d} \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\) or \\( \\frac{fb}{d^2} \\), it follows, that the relative strengths of different beams are proportional to the absolute cohesion of the particles, to the breadth, and to the square of the depth directly, and to the length inversely; also in prisms whose sections are similar, the strengths are as the cubes of the diameters.\n\nSuch are the more general results of the mechanism of this transverse strain, in the hypothesis that all the particles are exerting equal forces in the instant of fracture. We are indebted for this doctrine to the celebrated Galileo; and it was one of the first specimens of the application of mathematics to the science of nature.\n\nWe have not included in the preceding investigation that action of the external force by which the solid is drawn sidewise, or tends to slide along the surface of fracture. We have supposed a particle E to be pulled only in the direction EA, perpendicular to the section of fracture, by the action of the crooked lever BAE. But it is also pulled in the direction EA; and its reaction is in some direction \\( \\epsilon E \\), compounded of \\( \\epsilon f \\), by which it resists being pulled outwards; and \\( \\epsilon e \\) by which it resists being pulled downwards. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the force \\( \\epsilon e \\), and only know that their accumulated sum is equal to the force \\( p \\); but in all important cases which occur in practice, it is unnecessary to attend to this force; because it is so small in comparison of the forces in the direction \\( \\epsilon e \\), as we easily conclude from the usual smallness of AD in comparison of AB.\n\nThe hypothesis of equal cohesion, exerted by all the particles in the instant of fracture, is not conformable to nature: for we know, that when a force is applied transversely at B, the beam is bent downwards, becoming convex on the upper side; that side is therefore on the stretch. The particles at D are farther removed from each other than those at E, and are therefore actually exerting greater cohesive forces. We cannot say with certainty and precision in what proportion each fibre is extended. It seems most probable that the extensions are proportional to the distances from A. We shall suppose this to be really the case. Now recollect the general law which we formerly said was observed in all moderate extensions, viz. that the attractive forces exerted by the dilated particles were proportional to their dilatations. Suppose now that the beam is so much bent that the particles at D are exerting their utmost force, and that this fibre is just ready to break or actually breaks. It is plain that a total fracture must immediately ensue; because the force which was superior to the full cohesion of the particle at D, and a certain portion of the cohesion of all the rest, will be more than superior to the full cohesion of the particle next within D, and a smaller portion of the cohesion of the remainder.\n\nNow let F represent, as before, the full force of the exterior fibre D, which is exerted by it in the instant of its breaking, and then the force exerted at the same instant by the fibre E will be had by this analogy, AD: AE, or \\( d : x = f : \\frac{f}{d} \\), and the force really exerted by the fibre E is \\( f \\times \\frac{x}{d} \\).\n\nThe force exerted by a fibre whose thickness is \\( x \\) is therefore \\( \\frac{fx}{d} \\); but this force resists the strain by acting by means of the lever EA or \\( x \\). Its energy or momentum is therefore \\( \\frac{fx}{d} \\), and the accumulated momenta of all the fibres in the line AE will be \\( f \\times \\text{sum of } \\frac{x}{d} \\). This, when \\( x \\) is taken equal to \\( d \\), will express the momentum of the whole fibres in the line AD. This, therefore, is \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\), or \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\), or \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\). Now \\( fbd \\) expresses the absolute cohesion of the whole line AD. The accumulated momentum is therefore the same as if the absolute cohesion of the whole line were exerted at one-third of AD from A.\n\nFrom these premises it follows that the equation expressing the equilibrium of the strain and cohesion is \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\); and hence we deduce the analogy, \"As the length is to the depth, so is the absolute cohesion to the relative strength.\"\n\nThis equation and this proportion will equally apply to rectangular beams whose breadth is \\( b \\); for we shall then have \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\).\n\nWe also see that the relative strength is proportional to the absolute cohesion of the particles, to the breadth, and to the square of the depth directly, and to the length inversely: for \\( p \\) is the measure of the force with which it is resisted, and \\( p = \\frac{fbd}{d} \\), \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\). In this respect therefore this hypothesis agrees with the Galilean; but it assigns to every beam a smaller proportion of the absolute cohesion of the section of fracture, in the proportion of three to two. In the Galilean hypothesis this section has a momentum equal to one-half of its absolute strength, but in the other hypothesis it is only one-third. In beams of a different form the proportion may be different.\n\nAs this is a most important proposition, and the foundation\nStrength of adhesion of many practical maxims, we are anxious to have it clearly comprehended, and its evidence perceived by all. Our better informed readers will therefore indulge us while we endeavour to present it in another point of view, where it will be better seen by those who are not familiarly acquainted with the fluxionary calculus.\n\nFig. 6. A is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of a three-sided beam projecting horizontally from a wall, and loaded with a weight at B just sufficient to break it. DABC is a vertical plane through its highest point D, in the direction of its length, aDa is another vertical section perpendicular to AB. The piece being supposed of insuperable strength everywhere except in the section aDa, and the cohesion being also supposed insuperable along the line aAa, it can break nowhere but in this section, and by turning round aAa as round a hinge. Make Dd equal to AD, and let Dd represent the absolute cohesion of the fibre at D, which absolute cohesion we express by the symbol f. Let a plane aDa be made to pass through aAa and d, and let d'a'd' be another cross section. It is plain that the prismatic solid contained between the two sections aDa and d'a'd' will represent the full cohesion of the whole section of fracture; for we may conceive this prism as made up of lines such as FF', equal and parallel to Dd, representing the absolute cohesion of each particle such as F. The pyramidal solid d'Daa, cut off by the plane daa, will represent the cohesions actually exerted by the different fibres in the instant of fracture. For take any point E in the surface of fracture, and draw Ee parallel to AB, meeting the plane aDa in e, and let eAE be a vertical plane. It is evident that Dd is to Ee as AD to AE; and therefore (since the forces exerted by the different fibres are as their extension, and their extension as their distances from the axis of fracture) Ee will represent the force actually exerted by the fibre in E, while D is exerting its full force Dd. In like manner, the plane FF'f' expresses the cohesion exerted by all the fibres in the line FF, and so on through the whole surface. Therefore the pyramid daaD expresses the accumulated exertion of the whole surface of fracture.\n\nFurther, suppose the beam to be held perpendicular to the horizon with the end B uppermost, and that the weight of the prism contained between the two sections aDa and d'a'd' (now horizontal) is just able to overcome the full cohesion of the section of fracture. The weight of the pyramid d'Daa will also be just able to overcome the cohesions actually exerted by the different fibres in the instant of fracture; because the weight of each fibre, such as Ee, is just superior to the cohesion actually exerted at E.\n\nLet o be the centre of gravity of the pyramidal solid, and draw oO perpendicular to the plane aDa. The whole weight of the solid d'Daa may be conceived as accumulated in the point o, and as acting on the point O, and it will have the same tendency to separate the two cohering surfaces as when each fibre is hanging by its respective point. For this reason the point O may be called the centre of actual effort of the unequal forces of cohesion. The momentum therefore, or energy by which the cohering surfaces are separated, will be properly measured by the weight of the solid d'Daa multiplied by OA; and this product is equal to the product of the weight p multiplied by BA, or by I.\n\nThus suppose that the cohesion along the line AD only strength of is considered. The whole cohesion will be represented by a triangle ADd'. Dd' represents f, and AD is d, and AD is x. Therefore ADd' is \\(\\frac{1}{2}fd'\\). The centre of gravity o of the triangle ADd' is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of a line drawn from A to the middle of Dd' with a line drawn from d' to the middle of AD; and therefore the line oO will make AO = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of AD. Therefore the actual momentum of cohesion is \\(f \\times \\frac{1}{2}d \\times \\frac{1}{3}d = \\frac{1}{6}fd^2\\), or equal to the absolute cohesion acting by means of the lever \\(\\frac{d}{3}\\). If the section of fracture is a rectangle, as in a common joint, whose breadth aa is b, it is plain that all the vertical lines will be represented by triangles like ADd'; and the whole actual cohesion will be represented by a wedge whose bases are vertical planes, and which is equal to half of the parallelepiped AD \\(\\times\\) Dd' \\(\\times\\) aa, and will therefore be \\(\\frac{1}{2}fbd'\\); and the distance AO of its centre of gravity from the horizontal line AA' will be \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of AD. The momentum of cohesion of a joint will therefore be \\(\\frac{1}{6}fbd' \\times \\frac{1}{3}d\\), or \\(fbd'^2\\), as we have determined in the other way.\n\nThe beam represented in the figure is a triangular prism. The pyramid Daad is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the prism aaDd'a'. If we make s represent the surface of the triangle aDa, the pyramid is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of fs. The distance AO of its centre of gravity from the horizontal line AA' is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of AD, or \\(\\frac{1}{3}d\\). Therefore the momentum of actual cohesion is \\(\\frac{1}{6}fs \\times \\frac{1}{3}d = \\frac{1}{18}fd^2\\); that is, it is the same as if the full cohesion of all the fibres were accumulated at a point I whose distance from A is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)th of AD or d; or (that we may see its value in every point of view) it is \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)th of the momentum of the full cohesion of all the fibres when accumulated at the point D, or acting at the distance d = AD.\n\nThis is a very convenient way of conceiving the momentum of actual cohesion, by comparing it with the momentum of absolute cohesion applied at the distance AD from the axis of fracture. The momentum of the absolute cohesion applied at D is to the momentum of actual cohesion in the instant of fracture as AD to AI. Therefore the length of AI, or its proportion to AD, is a sort of index of the strength of the beam. We shall call it the Index, and express it by the symbol i.\n\nIts value is easily obtained. The product of the absolute cohesion by AI must be equal to that of the actual cohesion by AO. Therefore say, \"as the prismatic solid aaDd'a' is to the pyramidal solid aaDd', so is AO to AI.\" We are assisted in this determination by a very convenient circumstance. In this hypothesis of the actual cohesions being as the distances of the fibres from A, the point O is the centre of oscillation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERCUSSION\">percussion</a> of the surface Da a turning round the axis aa; for the momentum of cohesion of the line FF is FF \\(\\times\\) FF \\(\\times\\) EA = FF \\(\\times\\) EA, because FF is equal to EA. Now AO, by the nature of the centre of gravity, is equal to the sum of all these momenta divided by the pyramid aaDd'; that is, by the sum of all the FF \\(\\times\\) FF; that is, by the sum of all the FF \\(\\times\\) EA.\n\nTherefore AO = \\(\\frac{\\text{sum of FF} \\times \\text{EA}}{\\text{sum of FF} \\times \\text{EA}}\\), which is just the value of the distance of the centre of percussion of the triangle aaD from A: (See Rotation). Moreover, if\nStrength of G be the centre of gravity of the triangle \\(aDa\\), we shall have DA to GA as the absolute cohesion to the sum of the cohesions actually exerted in the instant of fracture; for, by the nature of this centre of gravity,\n\n\\[ AG \\text{ is equal to } \\frac{\\text{sum of } FF \\times EA}{\\text{sum of } FF}, \\]\n\nand the sum of \\(FF \\times EA\\) is equal to the sum of \\(FF \\times EA\\). But the sum of all the lines \\(FF\\) is the triangle \\(aDa\\), and the sum of all the \\(FF \\times EA\\) is the sum of all the rectangles \\(FFff\\); that is, the pyramid \\(dDa\\). Therefore a prism whose base is the triangle \\(aDa\\), and whose height is \\(AG\\), is equal to the pyramid, or will express the sum of the actual cohesions; and a prism, whose base is the same triangle, and whose height is \\(Dd\\) or \\(Da\\), expresses the absolute cohesion. Therefore DA is to GA as the absolute cohesion to the sum of the actual cohesions.\n\nTherefore we have DA : GA = OA : IA.\n\nTherefore, whatever be the form of the beam, that is, whatever be the figure of its section, find the centre of oscillation O, and the centre of gravity G of this section. Call their distances from the axis of fracture o and g. Then AI or \\(i = \\frac{og}{d}\\), and the momentum of cohesion is \\(fs \\times \\frac{og}{d}\\), where \\(s\\) is the area of fracture.\n\nThis index is easily determined in all the cases which generally occur in practice. In a rectangular beam AI is \\(d\\) AD; in a cylinder (circular or elliptic) AI is \\(2\\) AD; and so on.\n\nIn this hypothesis, that the cohesion actually exerted by each fibre is as its extension, and that the extensions of the fibres are as their distances from A (fig. 5), it is plain that the forces exerted by the fibres D, E, &c., will be represented by the ordinates \\(Dd\\), \\(Ee\\), &c., to a straight line \\(ad\\). And we learn from the principles of Rotation that the centre of percussion O is in the ordinate which passes through the centre of gravity of the triangle \\(ADd\\), or (if we consider the whole section having breadth as well as depth) through the centre of gravity of the solid bounded by the planes \\(DA\\), \\(dA\\); and we found that this point O was the centre of effort of the cohesions actually exerted in the instant of fracture, and that I was the centre of an equal momentum, which would be produced if all the fibres were accumulated there and exerted their full cohesion.\n\nThis consideration enables us to determine, with equal facility and neatness, the strength of a beam in any hypotheses of forces. The above hypothesis was introduced with a cautious limitation to moderate strains, which produced no permanent change of form, or no set as the artists call it; and this suffices for all purposes of practice, seeing that it would be imprudent to expose materials to more violent strains. But when we compare this theory with experiments in which the pieces are really broken, considerable deviations may be expected, because it is very probable that in the vicinity of rupture the forces are no longer proportional to the extensions.\n\nThat no doubt may remain as to the justness and completeness of the theory, we must show how the relative strength may be determined in any other hypothesis. Therefore suppose that it has been established by experiment on any kind of solid matter, that the forces actually exerted in the instant of fracture by the fibres at D, E, &c., are as the ordinates \\(Dd\\), \\(Ee\\), &c., of any strength of curve line \\(Ae'd'\\). We are supposed to know the form of this curve, and that of the solid which is bounded by the vertical plane through AD, and by the surface which passes through this curve \\(Ae'd'\\) perpendicularly to the length of the beam. We know the place of the centre of gravity of this curve surface or solid, and can draw a line through it parallel to AB, and cutting the surface of fracture in some point O. This point is also the centre of effort of all the cohesions actually exerted; and the product of AO and of the solid which expresses the actual cohesions will give the momentum of cohesion equivalent to the former \\(fs \\times \\frac{og}{d}\\). Or we may find an index AI, by making AI a fourth proportional to the full cohesion of the surface of fracture, to the accumulated actual cohesions, and to AO; and then \\(fs \\times i\\) (=AI) will be the momentum of cohesion; and we shall still have I for the point in which all the fibres may be supposed to exert their full cohesion \\(f\\), and to produce a momentum of cohesion equal to the real momentum of the cohesions actually exerted, and the relative strength of the beam will still be \\(p = \\frac{fsi}{l} = \\frac{fsgo}{dl}\\).\n\nThus, if the forces be as the squares of the extensions (still supposed to be as the distances from A), the curve \\(Ae'd'\\) will be a common parabola, having AB for its axis and AD for the tangent at its vertex. The area \\(ADd'\\) will be \\(dAD \\times Dd\\); and in the case of a rectangular beam, AO will be \\(d\\) AD, and AI will be \\(d\\) AD.\n\nWe may observe here in general, that if the forces actually exerted in the instant of fracture be as any power \\(q\\) of the distance from A, the index AI will be \\(= \\frac{AD}{q+2}\\) for a rectangular beam, and the momentum of cohesion will always be (ceteris paribus) as the breadth and as the square of the depth; nay, this will be the case whenever the action of the fibres D and E is expressed by any similar functions of \\(d\\) and \\(x\\). This is evident to every reader acquainted with the fluxionary calculus.\n\nAs far as we can judge from experience, no simple algebraic power of the distance will express the actual cohesions of the fibres. No curve which has either AD or AB for its tangent will suit. The observations which we made in the beginning show, that although the curve of fig. 2, must be sensibly straight in the vicinity of the points of intersection with the axis, in order to agree with our observations which show the moderate extensions to be as the extending forces, the curve must be concave towards the axis in all its attractive branches, because it cuts it again. Therefore the curve \\(Ae'd'\\) of fig. 5, must make a finite angle with AD or AB, and it must, in all probability, be also concave towards AD in the neighbourhood of \\(d'\\). It may however be convex in some part of the intermediate arch. We have made experiments on the extensions of different bodies, and find great diversities in this respect: But in all, the moderate extensions were as the forces, and this with great accuracy till the body took a set, and remained longer than formerly when the extending force was removed.\n\nWe must now remark, that this correction of the Galilean hypothesis of equal forces was suggested by the bending...\nStrength of bending which is observed in all bodies which are strained transversely. Because they are bent, the fibres on the convex side have been extended. We cannot say in what proportion this obtains in the different fibres. Our most distinct notions of the internal equilibrium between the particles render it highly probable that their extension is proportional to their distance from that fibre which retains its former dimensions. But by whatever law this is regulated, we see plainly that the actions of the stretched fibres must follow the proportions of some function of this distance, and that therefore the relative strength of a beam is in all cases susceptible of mathematical determination.\n\nWe also see an intimate connection between the strain and the curvature. This suggested to the celebrated James Bernoulli the problem of the Elastic Curve, i.e., the curve into which an extensible rigid body will be bent by a transverse strain. His solution in the Acta Lipiae 1694 and 1695 is a very beautiful specimen of mathematical discussion; and we recommend it to the perusal of the curious reader. He will find it very perspicuously treated in the first volume of his works, published after his death, where the wide steps which he had taken in his investigation are explained so as to be easily comprehended. His nephew Daniel Bernoulli has given an elegant abridgement in the Petersburg Memoirs for 1729. The problem is too intricate to be fully discussed in a work like ours; but it is also too intimately connected with our present subject to be entirely omitted. We must content ourselves with showing the leading mechanical properties of this curve, from which the mathematician may deduce all its geometrical properties.\n\nWhen a bar of uniform depth and breadth, and of a given length, is bent into an arch of a circle, the extension of the outer fibres is proportional to the curvature; for, because the curves formed by the inner and outer sides of the beam are similar, the circumferences are as the radii, and the radius of the inner circle is to the difference of the radii as the length of the inner circumference is to the difference of the circumferences. The difference of the radii is the depth of the beam, the difference of the circumferences is the extension of the outer fibres, and the inner circumference is supposed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> length of the beam. Now the second and third quantities of the above analogy, viz., the depth and length of the beam, are constant quantities, as is also their product. Therefore the product of the inner radius and the extension of the outer fibre is also a constant quantity, and the whole extension of the outer fibre is inversely as the radius of curvature, or is directly as the curvature of the beam.\n\nThe mathematical reader will readily see, that into whatever curve the elastic bar is bent, the whole extension of the outer fibre is equal to the length of a similar curve, having the same proportion to the thickness of the beam that the length of the beam has to the radius of curvature.\n\nNow let ADCB (fig. 7.) be such a rod, of uniform breadth and thickness, firmly fixed in a vertical position, and bent into a curve AETB by a weight W suspended at B, and of such magnitude that the extremity B has its tangent perpendicular to the action of the weight, or parallel to the horizon. Suppose too that the extensions are proportional to the extending forces. From any two points E and F draw the horizontal ordinates EG, FH. It is evident that the exterior fibres of the sections Ee and Ff are stretched by forces which are in the proportion of EG to FH (these being the long arms of the levers, and the equal thicknesses Ee, Ff being the short arms). Therefore (by the hypothesis) their extensions are in the same proportion. But because the extensions are proportional to some similar functions of the distance from the axes of fracture E and F, the extension of any fibre in the section Ee is to the contemporaneous extension of the similarly situated fibre in the section Ff, as the extension of the exterior fibre in the section Ee is to the extension of the exterior fibre in the section Ff; therefore the whole extension of Ee is to the whole extension of Ff as EG to FH, and EG is to FH as the curvature in E to the curvature in F.\n\nHere let it be remarked, that this proportionality of the curvature to the extension of the fibres is not limited to the hypothesis of the proportionality of the extensions to the extending forces. It follows from the extension in the different sections being as some similar function of the distance from the axis of fracture; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> which cannot be refused.\n\nThis then is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> property of the elastic curve, from which its equation, or relation between the abscissa and ordinate, may be deduced in the usual forms, and all its other geometrical properties. These are foreign to our purpose; and we shall notice only such properties as have an immediate relation to the strain and strength of the different parts of a flexible body, and which in particular serve to explain some difficulties in the valuable experiments of M. Buffon on the Strength of Beams.\n\nWe observe, in the first place, that the elastic curve is not a circle, but is gradually more incurvated as it recedes from the point of application B of the straining forces. At B it has no curvature; and if the bar were extended beyond B there would be no curvature there. In like manner, when a beam is supported at the ends and loaded in the middle, the curvature is greatest in the middle; but at the props, or beyond them, if the beam extend farther, there is no curvature. Therefore when a beam projecting 20 feet from a wall is bent to a certain curvature at the wall by a weight suspended at the end, and a beam of the same size projecting 20 feet is bent to the very same curvature at the wall by a greater weight at 10 feet distance, the figure and the mechanical state of the beam in the vicinity of the wall is different in these two cases, though the curvature at the very wall is the same in both. In the first case every part of the beam is incurvated; in the second, all beyond the 10 feet is without curvature. In the first experiment the curvature at the distance of five feet from the wall is three-fourths of the curvature at the wall; in the second, the curvature at the same place is but one-half of that at the wall. This must weaken the long beam in this whole interval of five feet, because the greater curvature is the result of a greater extension of the fibres.\n\nIn the next place, we may remark, that there is a certain determinate curvature for every beam which cannot be exceeded without breaking it; for there is a certain separation of two adjoining particles that puts an end to their cohesion. A fibre can therefore...\nStrength of be extended only a certain proportion of its length.\n\nThe ultimate extension of the outer fibres must bear a certain determinate proportion to its length, and this proportion is the same with that of the thickness (or what we have hitherto called the depth) to the radius of ultimate curvature, which is therefore determinate.\n\nA beam of uniform breadth and depth is therefore most incurvated where the strain is greatest, and will break in the most incurvated part. But by changing its form, so as to make the strength of its different sections in the ratio of the strain, is evident that the curvature may be the same throughout, or may be made to vary according to any law. This is a remarkable problem in practical mechanics is so to taper the balance-spring of a watch that its wide and narrow vibrations may be isochronous. Hooke's principle ut tensio sic vis is not sufficient when we take the inertia and motion of the spring itself into the account. The figure into which it bends and unbends has also an influence. Our readers will take notice that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">artificer</a> aims at an accuracy which will not admit an error of \\( \\frac{1}{8000} \\)th, and that Harrison and Arnold have actually attained it in several instances. The taper of a spring is at present a nostrum in the hands of each artificer, and he is careful not to impart his secret.\n\nAgain, since the depth of the beam is thus proportional to the radius of ultimate curvature, this ultimate or breaking curvature is inversely as the depth. It may be expressed by \\( \\frac{I}{d} \\).\n\nWhen a weight is hung on the end of a prismatic beam, the curvature is nearly as the weight and the length directly, and as the breadth and the cube of the depth inversely; for the strength is \\( \\frac{b^2 d^3}{3l} \\). Let us suppose that this produces the ultimate curvature \\( \\frac{I}{d} \\).\n\nNow let the beam be loaded with a smaller weight \\( w \\), and let the curvature produced be \\( C \\), we have this analogy \\( \\frac{b^2 d^3}{3l} : w = \\frac{1}{d} : C \\), and \\( C = \\frac{3lw}{fb^2 d^3} \\). It is evident that this is also true of a beam supported at the ends and loaded between the props; and we see how to determine the curvature in its different parts, whether arising from the load, or from its own weight, or from both.\n\nWhen a beam is thus loaded at the end or middle, the loaded point is pulled down, and the space through which it is drawn may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>. This may be considered as the subtense of the angle of contact, or as the versed sine of the arch into which the beam is bent, and is therefore as the curvature when the length of the arches is given (the flexure being moderate), and as the square of the length of the arch when the curvature is given. The deflection therefore is as the curvature and as the square of the length of the arch jointly; that is, \\( \\frac{3lw}{fb^2 d^3} \\times l^2 \\), or as \\( \\frac{3lw}{fb^2 d^3} \\). The deflection from the primitive shape is therefore as the bending weight and the cube of the length directly, and as the breadth and cube of the depth inversely.\n\nIn beams just ready to break, the curvature is as the depth inversely, and the deflection is as the square of strength of the length divided by the depth; for the ultimate curvature at the breaking part is the same whatever is the length; and in this case the deflection is as the square of the length.\n\nWe have been the more particular in our consideration from this subject, because the resulting theorems afford us a fine method of examining the laws of corporeal nature and action, that is, for discovering the variation of the force of cohesion by a change of distance. It is true it is not amenable to the atomic law, or Hylarchic Principle as it may the laws of justly be called, which is thus made accessible, but the specific law of the particles of the substance or kind of matter under examination. But even this is a very great point; and coincidences in this respect among the different kinds of matter are of great moment. We may thus learn the nature of the corporeal action of different substances, and perhaps approach to a discovery of the mechanism of chemical affinities. For that chemical actions are insensible cases of local motion is undeniable, and local motion is the province of mechanical diffusion; nay, we see that these hidden changes are produced by mechanical forces in many important cases, for we see them promoted or prevented by means purely mechanical. The conversion of bodies into elastic vapour by heat can at all times be prevented by a sufficient external pressure. A strong solution of Glauber's salt will congeal in an instant by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, giving out its latent heat; and it will remain fluid for ever, and return its latent heat in a close vessel which it completely fills. Even water will by such treatment freeze in an instant by agitation, or remain fluid for ever by confinement. We know that heat is produced or extracted by friction, that certain compounds of gold or silver with saline matters explode with irresistible violence by the smallest pressure or agitation. Such facts should rouse the mathematical philosopher, and excite him to follow out the conjectures of the illustrious Newton, encouraged by the ingenious attempts of Bofovich; and the proper beginning of this study is to attend to the laws of attraction and repulsion exerted by the particles of cohering bodies, discoverable by experiments made on their actual extensions and compressions. The experiments of simple extensions and compressions are quite insufficient, because the total stretching of a wire is so small a quantity, that the mistake of the thousandth part of an inch occasions an irregularity which deranges any progression so as to make it useless. But by the bending of bodies, a diffusion of \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\)th of an inch may be easily magnified in the deflection of the spring ten thousand times. We know that the investigation is intricate and difficult, but not beyond the reach of our present mathematical attainments; and it will give very fine opportunities of employing all the address of analysis. In the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th this was a sufficient excitement to the first geniuses of Europe. The cycloid, the catenaria, the elastic curve, the velaria, the caustics, were reckoned an abundant recompense for much study; and James Bernoulli requested, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> monument, that the logarithmic spiral might be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> on his tombstone. The reward for the study to which we now presume to incite the mathematicians is the almost unlimited extension of natural science, important in every particular branch. To go no further than our present subject, a great deal of important practical knowledge\nStrength of bodies respecting the strength of bodies is derived from the single observation, that in the moderate extensions which happen before the parts are overstretched the forces are nearly in the proportion of the extensions or separations of the particles. To return to our subject.\n\nJames Bernoulli, in his second dissertation on the elastic curve, calls in question this law, and accommodates his investigation to any hypothesis concerning the relation of the forces and extensions. He relates some experiments of late strings where the relation was considerably different. Strings of three feet long,\n\n| Stretched by | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 pds. |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Were lengthened | 9, 17, 23, 27, 30 lines |\n\nBut this is a most exceptionable form of the experiment. The strings were twisted, and the mechanism of the extensions is here exceedingly complicated, combined with compressions and with transverse twists, &c. We made experiments on fine slips of the gum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAOUTCHOUC\">caoutchouc</a>, and on the juice of the berries of the white bryony, of which a single grain will draw to a thread of two feet long, and again return into a perfectly round sphere. We measured the diameter of the thread by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> with a micrometer, and thus could tell in every state of extension the proportional number of particles in the sections. We found, that though the whole range in which the distance of the particles was changed in the proportion of 13 to 1, the extensions did not sensibly deviate from the proportion of the forces. The same thing was observed in the caoutchouc as long as it perfectly recovered its first dimensions. And it is on the authority of these experiments that we presume to announce this as a law of nature.\n\nDr Robert Hooke was undoubtedly the first who attended to this subject, and assumed this as a law of nature. Mariotte indeed was the first who expressly used it for determining the strength of beams: this he did about the 1679, correcting the simple theory of Galileo. Leibnitz indeed, in his dissertation in the Acta Eruditorum 1684 de Reflextionis Solidorum, introduces this consideration, and wishes to be considered as the discoverer; and he is always acknowledged as such by the Bernoullis and others who adhered to his peculiar doctrines. But Mariotte had published the doctrine in the most approved terms long before; and Bullinger, in the Comment. Petropol. 1729, completely vindicates his claim. But Hooke was unquestionably the discoverer of this law. It made the foundation of his theory of springs, announced to the Royal Society about the year 1661, and read in 1666. On this occasion he mentions many things on the strength of bodies as quite familiar to his thoughts, which are immediate deductions from this principle; and among these all the facts which John Bernoulli so vauntingly adduces in support of Leibnitz's finical dogmas about the force of bodies in motion; a doctrine which Hooke might have claimed as his own, had he not perceived its frivolous insanity.\n\nBut even with this first correction of Mariotte, the mechanism of transverse strain is not fully nor justly explained. The force acting in the direction BP (fig. 5.), and bending the body ABCD, not only stretches the fibres on the side opposite to the axis of fracture, but compresses the fibre AB, which becomes concave by the strain. Indeed it cannot do the one without doing the other: For in order to stretch the fibres at D, there must be some fulcrum, some support, on which the vir-Strength of tual lever BAD may press, that it may tear afunder the stretched fibres. This fulcrum must sustain both the pressure arising from the cohesion of the distended fibres, and also the action of the external force, which immediately tends to cause the prominent part of the beam to slide along the section DA. Let BAD (fig. 5.) be considered as a crooked lever, of which A is the fulcrum. Let an external force be applied at B in the direction BP, and let a force equal to the accumulated cohesion of AD be applied at O in the direction opposite to AB, that is, perpendicular to AO; and let these two forces be supposed to balance each other by the intervention of the lever. In the first place, the force at O must be to the force at B as AB to AO: Therefore, if we make AK equal and opposite to AO, and AL equal and opposite to AB, the common principles of mechanics inform us that the fulcrum A is affected in the same manner as if the two forces AK and AL were immediately applied to it, the force AK being equal to the weight P, and AL equal to the accumulated cohesion actually exerted in the instant of fracture. The fulcrum is therefore really pressed in the direction AM, the diagonal of the parallelogram, and it must resist in the direction and with the force MA; and this power of resistance, this support, must be furnished by the repulsive forces exerted by those particles only which are in a state of actual compression. The force AK, which is equal to the external force P, must be resisted in the direction KA by the lateral cohesion of the whole particles between D and A (the particle D is not only drawn forward but downward). This prevents the part CDAB from sliding down along the section DA.\n\nThis is fully verified by experiment. If we attempt to break a long slip of cork, or any such very compressible body, we always observe it to bulge out on the concave side before it cracks on the other side. If it is a body of fibrous or foliated texture, it seldom fails splintering off on the concave side; and in many cases this splintering is very deep, even reaching half way through the piece. In hard and granulated bodies, such as a piece of freestone, chalk, dry clay, sugar, and the like, we generally see a considerable splinter or shiver fly off from the hollow side. If the fracture be slowly made by a force at B gradually augmented, the formation of the splinter is very distinctly seen. It forms a triangular piece like a Ib, which generally breaks in the middle. We doubt not but that attentive observation would show that the direction of the crack on each side of I is not very different from the direction AM and its correspondent on the other side. This is by no means a circumstance of idle curiosity, but intimately connected with the mechanism of cohesion.\n\nLet us see what consequences result from this state of consequence the case respecting the strength of bodies. Let DAKC be a fulcrum (fig. 8.) representing a vertical section of a prism of compressible materials, such as a piece of timber. Suppose the loaded with a weight P hung at its extremity. Suppose it of such a constitution that all the fibres in AD are in a state of dilatation, while those in AA are in a state of compression. In the instant of fracture the particles at D and E are with-held by forces D d, E e, and the particles at A and E repel, resist, or support, with forces A a, E e.\n\nSome line, such as d e A a, will limit all these ordinates.\nStrength of nates, which represent the forces actually exerted in the instant of fracture. If the forces be as the extensions and compressions, as we have great reason to believe, \\(d_e A\\) and \\(A_e d\\) will be two straight lines. They will form one straight line \\(d A d\\), if the forces which resist a certain dilatation are equal to the forces which resist an equal compression. But this is quite accidental, and is not strictly true in any body. In most bodies which have any considerable firmness, the compressions made by any external force are not so great as the dilatations which the same force would produce; that is, the repulsions which are excited by any supposed degree of compression are greater than the attractions excited by the same degree of dilatation. Hence it will generally follow, that the angle \\(d A D\\) is less than the angle \\(d A D\\), and the ordinates \\(D_d, E_e, \\&c.\\) are less than the corresponding ordinates \\(D_d, E_e, \\&c.\\).\n\nBut whatever be the nature of the line \\(d A d\\), we are certain of this, that the whole area \\(ADd\\) is equal to the whole area \\(A_d A_d\\); for as the force at \\(B\\) is gradually increased, and the parts between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) are more extended, and greater cohesive forces are excited, there is always such a degree of repulsive forces excited in the particles between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) that the one set precisely balances the other. The force at \\(B\\), acting perpendicularly to \\(AB\\), has no tendency to push the whole piece closer on the part next the wall or to pull it away. The sum of the attractive and repulsive forces actually excited must therefore be equal. These sums are represented by the two triangular areas, which are therefore equal.\n\nThe greater we suppose the repulsive forces corresponding to any degree of compression, in comparison with the attractive forces corresponding to the same degree of extension, the smaller will \\(A_d\\) be in comparison of \\(AD\\). In a piece of cork or sponge, \\(A_d\\) may chance to be equal to \\(AD\\), or even to exceed it; but in a piece of marble, \\(A_d\\) will perhaps be very small in comparison of \\(AD\\).\n\nNow it is evident that the repulsive forces excited between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) have no share in preventing the fracture. They rather contribute to it, by furnishing a fulcrum to the lever, by whose energy the cohesion of the particles in \\(AD\\) is overcome. Hence we see an important consequence of the compressibility of the body. Its power of resisting this transverse strain is diminished by it, and so much the more diminished as the stuff is more compressible.\n\nThis is fully verified by some very curious experiments made by Du Hamel. He took 16 bars of willow 2 feet long and \\(1/2\\) an inch square, and supporting them by props under the ends, he broke them by weights hung on the middle. He broke 4 of them by weights of 40, 41, 47, and 52 pounds; the mean is 45. He then cut 4 of them \\(1/2\\) through on the upper side, and filled up the cut with a thin piece of harder wood stuck in pretty tight. These were broken by 48, 54, 50, and 52 pounds; the mean of which is 51. He cut other four \\(1/2\\) through, and they were broken by 47, 49, 50, 46; the mean of which is 48. The remaining four were cut \\(1/3\\)ds; and their mean strength was 42.\n\nAnother set of his experiments is still more remarkable.\n\nSix battens of willow 36 inches long and \\(1/2\\) square were broken by 525 pounds at a medium.\n\nSix bars were cut \\(1/2\\) through, and the cut filled with a wedge of hard wood stuck in with a little force; these broke with 551.\n\nSix bars were cut half through, and the cut was filled in the same manner; they broke with 542.\n\nSix bars were cut \\(1/3\\)s through; these broke with 530.\n\nA batten cut \\(1/4\\)ths through, and loaded till nearly broken, was unloaded, and the wedge taken out of the cut. A thicker wedge was put in tight, so as to make the batten straight again by filling up the space left by the compression of the wood; this batten broke with 577 pounds.\n\nFrom this it is plain that more than \\(1/3\\)ds of the thickness (perhaps nearly \\(1/4\\)ths) contributed nothing to the strength.\n\nThe point \\(A\\) is the centre of fracture in this case; and in order to estimate the strength of the piece, we may suppose that the crooked lever virtually concerned in the strain is \\(DAB\\). We must find the point \\(I\\), which is the centre of effort of all the attractive forces, or that point where the full cohesion of \\(AD\\) must be applied, so as to have a momentum equal to the accumulated momenta of all the variable forces. We must in like manner find the centre of effort \\(i\\) of the repulsive or supporting forces exerted by the fibres lying between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\).\n\nIt is plain, and the remark is important, that this last centre of effort is the real fulcrum of the lever, although \\(A\\) is the point where there is neither extension nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>; for the lever is supported in the same manner as if the repulsions of the whole line \\(AD\\) were exerted at that point. Therefore let \\(S\\) represent the surface of fracture from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\), and \\(f\\) represent the absolute cohesion of a fibre at \\(D\\) in the instant of fracture. We shall have \\(fS \\times I + i = pI\\), or \\(fI + i = fS : p\\); that is, the length \\(AB\\) is to the distance between the two centres of effort \\(I\\) and \\(i\\), as the absolute cohesion of the section between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) is to the relative strength of the section.\n\nIt would be perhaps more accurate to make \\(AI\\) and \\(Ai\\) equal to the distances of \\(A\\) from the horizontal lines passing through the centres of gravity of the triangles \\(dAD\\) and \\(dA_d\\). It is only in this construction that the points \\(I\\) and \\(i\\) are the centres of real effort of the accumulated attractions and repulsions. But \\(I\\) and \\(i\\), determined as we have done, are the points where the full, equal, actions may be all applied, so as to produce the same momenta. The final results are the same in both cases.\n\nThe attentive and duly informed reader will see that Mr. Bulfinch, in a very elaborate dissertation on the strength of beams in the Comment. Petropolitan. 1729, has committed several mistakes in his estimation of the actions of the fibres. We mention this because his reasonings are quoted and appealed to as authorities by Mutchtenbroek and other authors of note. The subject has been considered by many authors on the continent. We recommend to the reader's perusal the very minute disquisitions in the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris for 1752 by Varignon, the Memoirs for 1768 by Parent, and particularly that of Coulomb in the Mem. par les Savans Etrangers, tom. vii.\n\nIt is evident from what has been said above, that if \\(S\\) and \\(i\\) represent the surfaces of the sections above and below \\(A\\), and if \\(G\\) and \\(g\\) are the distances of their centres of gravity from \\(A\\), and \\(O\\) and \\(o\\) the distances of their centres...\nStrength of centres of oscillation, and D and d their whole depths, Materials.\n\nthe momentum of cohesion will be \\( \\frac{fS \\cdot G \\cdot O}{D} = \\frac{fS \\cdot g \\cdot o}{d} \\)\n\n\\( = p.l. \\)\n\nIf (as is most likely) the forces are proportional to the extensions and compressions, the distances AI and Ai, which are respectively \\( \\frac{G \\cdot O}{D} \\) and \\( \\frac{g \\cdot o}{d} \\), are respectively \\( \\frac{1}{3} DA \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\Delta A \\); and when taken together are \\( \\frac{1}{3} DA \\). If, moreover, the extensions are equal to the compressions in the instant of fracture, and the body is a rectangular prism like a common joist or beam, then DA and \\( \\Delta A \\) are also equal; and therefore the momentum of cohesion is \\( fb \\times \\frac{1}{3} d \\times \\frac{1}{3} d = \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{6} \\).\n\nHence we obtain this analogy, \"Six times the length is to the depth as the absolute cohesion of the section is to its relative strength.\"\n\nThus we see that the compressibility of bodies has a very great influence on their power of withstanding a transverse strain. We see that in this most favourable supposition of equal dilatations and compressions, the strength is reduced to one half of the value of what it would have been had the body been incompressible. This is by no means obvious; for it does not readily appear how compressibility, which does not diminish the cohesion of a single fibre, should impair the strength of the whole. The reason, however, is sufficiently convincing when pointed out. In the instant of fracture a smaller portion of the section is actually exerting cohesive forces, while a part of it is only serving as a fulcrum to the lever, by whose means the strain on the section is produced. We see too that this diminution of strength does not so much depend on the sensible compressibility, as on its proportion to the dilatability by equal forces. When this proportion is small, \\( \\Delta A \\) is small in comparison of AD, and a greater portion of the whole fibre is exerting attractive forces.\n\nThe experiments already mentioned, of Du Hamel de Monceau, on battens of willow, show that its compressibility is nearly equal to its dilatability. But the case is not very different in tempered steel. The famous Harrison, in the delicate experiments which he made while occupied in making his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> watch, discovered that a rod of tempered steel was nearly as much diminished in its length as it was augmented by the same external force. But it is not by any means certain that this is the proportion of dilatation and compression which obtains in the very instant of fracture. We rather imagine that it is not. The forces are nearly as the dilatations till very near breaking; but we think that they diminish when the body is just going to break. But it seems certain that the forces which resist compression increase faster than the compressions, even before fracture. We know incontrovertibly that the ultimate refinements to compression are insuperable by any force which we can employ. The repulsive forces therefore (in their whole extent) increase faster than the compressions, and are expressed by an asymptotic branch of the Bofcovician curve formerly explained. It is therefore probable, especially in the more simple substances, that they increase faster, even in such compressions as frequently obtain in the breaking of hard bodies. We are disposed to think that this is always the case in such bodies as do not fly off in splinters on the concave side; but this must be understood with the exception of the permanent changes of which may be made by compression, when the bodies are crippled by it. This always increases the compression itself, and causes the neutral point to shift still more towards D. The effect of this is sometimes very great and fatal.\n\nExperiment alone can help us to discover the proportion between the dilatability and compressibility of bodies. The strain now under consideration seems the best calculated for this research. Thus if we find that a piece of wood an inch square requires 12,000 pounds to tear it asunder by a direct pull, and that 200 pounds will break it transversely by acting 10 inches from the section of fracture, we must conclude that the neutral point A is in the middle of the depth, and that the attractive and repulsive forces are equal. Any notions that we can form of the constitution of such fibrous bodies as timber, make us imagine that the sensible compressions, including what arises from the bending up of the compressed fibres, is much greater than the real corporeal extensions. One may get a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of this unexpected proposition by reflecting on what must happen during the fracture. An undulated fibre can only be drawn straight, and then the corporeal extension begins; but it may be bent up by compression to any degree, the corporeal compression being little affected all the while. This observation is very important; and though the forces of corporeal repulsion may be almost insuperable by any compression that we can employ, a sensible compression may be produced by forces not enormous, sufficient to cripple the beam. Of this we shall see very important instances afterwards.\n\nIt deserves to be noticed, that although the relative strength of a prismatic fold is extremely different in the proportional three hypotheses now considered, yet the proportional strengths of different pieces follow the same ratio; namely, the direct ratio of the breadth, the direct ratio of the square of the depth, and the inverse ratio of the same length. In the first hypothesis (of equal forces) the strength of a rectangular beam was \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{2l} \\); in the second (of attractive forces proportioned to the extensions) it was \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{3l} \\); and in the third (equal attractions and repulsions proportional to the extensions and compressions) it was \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{6l} \\), or more generally \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{ml} \\), where m expresses the unknown proportion between the attractions and repulsions corresponding to an equal extension and compression.\n\nHence we derive a piece of useful information, which is confirmed by unexceptionable experience, that the strength of a piece depends chiefly on its depth, that is, a piece deep in that dimension which is in the direction of the strain, pends chiefly on its depth is four times as strong as a bar of only one inch deep, and it is twice as strong as a bar two inches broad and one deep; that is, a joist or lever is always strongest when laid on its edge.\n\nThere is therefore a choice in the manner in which force a the cohesion is opposed to the strain. The general aim must be to put the centre of effort I as far from the fulcrum or the neutral point A as possible, so as to give the greatest energy or momentum to the cohesion. Thus if a triangular bar projecting from a wall is loaded with a weight, the strain...\nStrength of weight at its extremity, it will bear thrice as much when one of the sides is uppermost as when it is undermost. The bar of fig. 6. would be three times as strong if the side AB were uppermost and the edge DC undermost.\n\nHence it follows that the strongest joist that can be cut out of a round tree is not the one which has the greatest quantity of timber in it, but such that the product of its breadth by the square of its depth shall be the greatest possible. Let ABCD (fig. 9.) be the section of this joist inscribed in the circle, AB being the breadth and AD the depth. Since it is a rectangular section, the diagonal BD is a diameter of the circle, and BAD is a right-angled triangle. Let BD be called \\(a\\), and BA be called \\(x\\); then \\(AD = \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\\).\n\nNow we have \\(AB \\times AD\\), or \\(x \\times a^2 - x^2\\), or \\(a^2 x - x^2\\), a maximum. Its fluxion \\(a^2 - 2x^2\\) must be made \\(= 0\\), or \\(a^2 = 3x^2\\), or \\(x^2 = \\frac{a^2}{3}\\). If therefore we make \\(DE = \\frac{1}{4} DB\\), and draw EC perpendicular to BD, it will cut the circumference in the point C, which determines the depth BC and the breadth CD.\n\nBecause \\(BD : BC = CD : CE\\), we have the area of the section BC-CD = BD-CE. Therefore the different sections having the same diagonal BD are proportional to their heights CE. Therefore the section BCDA is less than the section BcDa, whose four sides are equal. The joist so shaped, therefore, is both stronger, lighter, and cheaper.\n\nThe strength of ABCD is to that of a BcD as 10,000 to 9186, and the weight and expense as 10,000 to 10,607; so that ABCD is preferable to a BcD in the proportion of 10,607 to 9186, or nearly 115 to 100.\n\nFrom the same principles it follows that a hollow tube is stronger than a solid rod containing the same quantity of matter.\n\nLet fig. 10. represent the section of a cylindrical tube, of which AF and BE are the exterior and interior diameters, and C the centre. Draw BD perpendicular to BC, and join DC. Then, because \\(BD^2 = CD^2 - CB^2\\), BD is the radius of a circle containing the same quantity of matter with the ring. If we estimate the strength by the first hypothesis, it is evident that the strength of the tube will be to that of the solid cylinder, whose radius is BD, as \\(BD^4 \\times AC\\) to \\(BD^4 \\times BD\\); that is, as AC to BD: for BD expresses the cohesion of the ring or the circle, and AC and BD are equal to the distances of the centres of effort (the same with the centres of gravity) of the ring and circle from the axis of the fracture.\n\nThe proportion of these strengths will be different in the other hypotheses, and is not easily expressed by a general formula; but in both it is still more in favour of the ring or hollow tube.\n\nThe following very simple solution will be readily understood by the intelligent reader. Let O be the centre of oscillation of the exterior circle, o the centre of oscillation of the inner circle, and w the centre of oscillation of the ring included between them. Let M be the quantity of surface of the exterior circle, m that of the inner circle, and \\(f\\) that of the ring.\n\nWe have \\(Fw = \\frac{M \\cdot FO - m \\cdot Fo}{f} = \\frac{5 FC^2 + EC^2}{4FC}\\)\n\nand the strength of the ring \\(= \\frac{f \\mu \\times 1Fw}{2}\\), and the strength of the same quantity of matter in the form of a solid cylinder is \\(f \\mu \\times \\frac{3}{8} BD\\); so that the strength of the ring is to that of the solid rod of equal weight as \\(Fw\\) to \\(\\frac{3}{4} BD\\), or nearly as FC to BD. This will easily appear by recollecting that \\(FO = \\frac{\\text{sum of } p \\cdot r^2}{m \\cdot FC}\\) (see Rotation), and that the momentum of cohesion is \\(\\frac{f \\mu \\cdot FC \\cdot Ca}{2 FC} = \\frac{f \\mu \\cdot Fo}{2}\\) for the inner circle, &c.\n\nEmerson has given a very inaccurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to this value in his Mechanics, &c.\n\nThis property of hollow tubes is accompanied also and more with greater stiffness; and the superiority in strength and stiffness is so much the greater as the surrounding shell is thinner in proportion to its diameter.\n\nHere we see the admirable wisdom of the Author of Nature in forming the bones of animal limbs hollow. The wisdom of God in bones of the arms and legs have to perform the office of levers, and are thus opposed to very great transverse forces, &c., strains. By this form they become incomparably stronger and stiffer, and give more room for the insertion of muscles, while they are lighter and therefore more agile; and the same Wisdom has made use of this hollow for other valuable purposes of the animal economy. In like manner the quills in the wings of birds acquire by their thinness the very great strength which is necessary, while they are so light as to give sufficient buoyancy to the animal in the rare medium in which it must live and fly about. The stalks of many plants, such as all the grasses, and many reeds, are in like manner hollow, and thus possess an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> strength. Our best engineers now begin to imitate nature by making many parts of their machines hollow, such as their axes of cast iron, &c.; and the ingenious Mr Ramden now makes the axes and framings of his great astronomical instruments in the same manner.\n\nIn the supposition of homogeneous texture, it is plain that the fracture happens as soon as the particles at D are separated beyond their utmost limit of cohesion. This is a determined quantity, and the piece bends till this degree of extension is produced in the outermost fibre. It follows, that the smaller we suppose the distance between A and D, the greater will be the curvature which the beam will acquire before it breaks. Greater depth therefore makes a beam not only stronger but also stiffer. But if the parallel fibres can slide on each other, both the strength and the stiffness will be diminished. Therefore if, instead of one beam DA KC Fig. 8. (fig. 8.) we suppose two, DABC and ADKB, not cohering, how each of them will bend, and the extension of the fibres strong AB of the under beam will not hinder the compression compound of the adjoining fibres AB of the upper beam. The beam may two together therefore will not be more than twice as be formed, strong as one of them (supposing DA = A D) instead of being four times as strong; and they will bend as much as either of them alone would bend by half the load. This may be prevented, if it were possible to unite the two beams all along the seam AB, so that the one shall not slide on the other. This may be done in small works, by gluing them together with a cement as strong as the natural lateral cohesion of the fibres. If this cannot be done (as it cannot in large works), the sliding is prevented by joggling the beams together; that is, by cutting down several rectangular notches in the upper side of the lower beam, and making similar notches in\nStrength of in the under side of the upper beam, and filling up the square spaces with pieces of very hard wood firmly driven in, as represented in fig. 11. Some employ iron bolts by way of joggles. But when the joggle is much harder than the wood into which it is driven, it is very apt to work loose, by widening the hole into which it is lodged. The same thing is sometimes done by scarfing the one upon the other, as represented in fig. 12.; but this wastes more timber, and is not so strong, because the mutual hooks which this method forms on each beam are very apt to tear each other up. By one or other of these methods, or something similar, may a compound beam be formed, of any depth, which will be almost as stiff and strong as an entire piece.\n\nOn the other hand, we may combine strength with pliability, by composing our beam of several thin planks laid on each other, till they make a proper depth, and leaving them at full liberty to slide on each other. It is in this manner that coach-springs are formed, as is represented in fig. 13. In this assemblage there must be no joggles nor bolts of any kind put through the planks or plates; for this would hinder their mutual sliding. They must be kept together by straps which surround them, or by something equivalent.\n\nThe preceding observations show the propriety of some maxims of construction, which the artists have derived from long experience.\n\nThus, if a mortise is to be cut out of a piece which is exposed to a cross strain, it should be cut out from that side which becomes concave by the strain, as in fig. 14., but by no means as in fig. 15.\n\nIf a piece is to be strengthened by the addition of another, the added piece must be joined to the side which grows convex by the strain, as in fig. 16. and 17.\n\nBefore we go any farther, it will be convenient to recall the reader's attention to the analogy between the strain on a beam projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and a beam supported at both ends and loaded in some intermediate point. It is sufficient on this occasion to read attentively what is delivered in the article Roof, No. 19.\u2014We learn there that the strain on the middle point C (fig. 17. of the present article) of a rectangular beam AB, supported on props at A and B, is the same as if the part CA projected from a wall, and were loaded with the half of the weight W suspended at A. The momentum of the strain is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} W \\times \\frac{1}{2} AB = W \\times \\frac{1}{2} AB = \\rho \\frac{1}{2} l$, or $\\rho \\frac{l}{4}$. The momentum of cohesion must be equal to this in every hypothesis.\n\nHaving now considered in sufficient detail the circumstances which affect the strength of any section of a solid body that is strained transversely, it is necessary to take notice of some of the chief modifications of the strain itself. We shall consider only those that occur most frequently in our constructions.\n\nThe strain depends on the external force, and also on the lever by which it acts.\n\nIt is evidently of importance, that since the strain is exerted in any section by means of the cohesion of the parts intervening between the section under consideration and the point of application of the external force, the body must be able in all these intervening parts to propagate or excite the strain in the remote section. In every part it must be able to resist the strain excited in that part. It should therefore be equally strong; and it is useless to have any part stronger, because the piece will nevertheless break where it is not stronger throughout; and it is useless to make it stronger (relatively to its strain) in any part, for it will nevertheless equally fail in the part that is too weak.\n\nSuppose then, in the first place, that the strain arises from a weight suspended at one extremity, while the other end is firmly fixed in a wall. Supposing also the cross sections to be all rectangular, there are several ways of shaping the beam so that it shall be equally strong throughout. Thus it may be equally deep in every part, the upper and under surfaces being horizontal planes. The condition will be fulfilled by making all the horizontal sections triangles, as in fig. 18. The Fig. 18. two sides are vertical planes meeting in an edge at the extremity L. For the equation expressing the balance of strain and strength is $p = f/b \\cdot d^2$. Therefore since $d^2$ is the same throughout, and also $p$, we must have $f/b = l$, and $b$ (the breadth AD of any section ABCD) must be proportional to $l$ (or AL), which it evidently is.\n\nOr, if the beam be of uniform breadth, we must have $d^2$ everywhere proportional to $l$. This will be obtained by making the depths the ordinates of a common parabola, of which L is the vertex and the length is the axis. The upper or under side may be a straight line, as in fig. 19., or the middle line may be straight, and Fig. 19., then both upper and under surfaces will be curved. It is almost indifferent what is the shape of the upper and under surfaces, provided the distances between them in every part be as the ordinates of a common parabola.\n\nOr, if the sections are all similar, such as circles, squares, or any other similar polygons, we must have $d^2$ or $b^2$ proportional to $l$, and the depths or breadths must be as the ordinates of a cubical parabola.\n\nIt is evident that these are also the proper forms for And on the lever moveable round a fulcrum, and acted on by a form of the force at the extremity. The force comes in the place levers by of the weight suspended in the cases already considered; acts, and as such levers always are connected with another arm, we readily see that both arms should be fashioned in the same manner. Thus in fig. 18. the piece of timber may be supposed a kind of steelyard, moveable round a horizontal axis OP, in the front of the wall, and having the two weights P and X in equilibrium. The strain occasioned by each at the section in which the axis OP is placed must be the same, and each arm OL and OA must be equally strong in all its parts. The longitudinal sections of each arm must be a triangle, a common parabola, or a cubic parabola, according to the conditions previously given.\n\nAnd, moreover, all these forms are equally strong: For any one of them is equally strong in all its parts, and they are all supposed to have the same section at the front of the wall or at the fulcrum. They are not, however, equally stiff. The first, represented in fig. 18., will bend least upon the whole, and the one formed by the cubic parabola will bend most. But their curvature at the very fulcrum will be the same in all.\n\nIt is also plain, that if the lever is of the second or third kind, that is, having the fulcrum at one extremity, it must still be of the same shape; for in abstract mechanics it is indifferent which of the three points is considered as the axis of motion. In every lever the\nStrength of two forces at the extremities act in one direction, and the force in the middle acts in the opposite direction, and the great strain is always at that point. Therefore a lever such as fig. 18, moveable round an axis passing horizontally through A, and acting against an obstacle at OP, is equally able in all its parts to resist the strains excited in those parts.\n\nThe same principles and the same construction will apply to beams, such as joists, supported at the ends L and A (fig. 18.), and loaded at some intermediate part OP. This will appear evident by merely inverting the directions of the forces at these three points, or by recurring to the article ROOF, No. 19.\n\nHitherto we have supposed the external straining force as acting only in one point of the beam. But it may be uniformly distributed all over the beam. To make a beam in such circumstances equally strong in all its parts, the shape must be considerably different from the former.\n\nThus suppose the beam to project from a wall. If it be of equal breadth throughout, its sides being vertical planes parallel to each other and to the length, the vertical section in the direction of its length must be a triangle instead of a common parabola; for the weight uniformly distributed over the part lying beyond any section, is as the length beyond that section: and since it may all be conceived as collected at its centre of gravity, which is the middle of that length, the lever by which this load acts or strains the section is also proportional to the same length. The strain on the section (or momentum of the load) is as the square of that length. The section must have strength in the same proportion. Its strength being as the breadth and the square of the depth, and the breadth being constant, the square of the depth of any section must be as the square of its distance from the end, and the depth must be as that distance; and therefore the longitudinal vertical section must be a triangle.\n\nBut if all the transverse sections are circles, squares, or any other similar figures, the strength of every section, or the cube of the diameter, must be as the square of the lengths beyond that section, or the square of its distance from the end; and the sides of the beam must be a semicubical parabola.\n\nIf the upper and under surfaces are horizontal planes, it is evident that the breadth must be as the square of the distance from the end, and the horizontal sections may be formed by arches of the common parabola, having the length for their tangent at the vertex.\n\nBy recurring to the analogy so often quoted between a projecting beam and a joist, we may determine the proper form of joists which are uniformly loaded through their whole length.\n\nThis is a frequent and important case, being the office of joists, rafters, &c.; and there are some circumstances which must be particularly noticed, because they are not so obvious, and have been misunderstood. When a beam AB (fig. 20.) is supported at the ends, and a weight is laid on any point P, a strain is excited in every part of the beam. The load on P causes the beam to press on A and B, and the props react with forces equal and opposite to these pressures. The load at P is to the pressures at A and B as AB to PB and PA, and the pressure at A is to that at B as PB to PA; the beam therefore is in the same state, with respect to strain in every part of it, as if it were resting Strength of on a prop at P, and were loaded at the ends with weights equal to the two pressures on the props: and observe, these pressures are such as will balance each other, being inversely as their distances from P. Let P represent the weight or load at P. The pressure on the prop P must be \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\). This is therefore the reaction of the prop B, and is the weight which we may suppose suspended at B, when we conceive the beam relling on a prop at P, and carrying the balancing weights at A and B.\n\nThe strain occasioned at any other point C, by the load P at P, is the same with the strain at C, by the weight \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\) hanging at B, when the beam rests on P, in the manner now supposed; and it is the same if the beam, instead of being balanced on a prop at P, had its part AP fixed in a wall. This is evident. Now we have shown at length that the strain at C, by the weight \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\) hanging at B, is \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\times BC \\). We define it to be particularly remarked that the pressure at A has no influence on the strain at C, arising from the action of any load between A and C; for it is indifferent how the part AP of the projecting beam PB is supported. The weight at A just performs the same office with the wall in which we suppose the beam to be fixed. We are thus particular, because we have seen even persons not unaccustomed to discussions of this kind puzzled in their conceptions of this strain.\n\nNow let the load P be laid on some point p between C and B. The same reasoning shows us that the point is (with respect to strain) in the same state as if the beam were fixed in a wall, embracing the part pB, and a weight \\( \\frac{pB}{AB} \\) were hung on at A, and the strain at C is \\( \\frac{pB}{AB} \\times AC \\).\n\nIn general, therefore, the strain on any point C, arising from a load P laid on another point P, is proportional to the rectangle of the distances of P and C from the ends nearest to each. It is \\( \\frac{PA \\times CB}{AB} \\), or \\( \\frac{pB \\times CA}{AB} \\), according as the load lies between C and A or between C and B.\n\nCor. 1. The strains which a load on any point P occasions on the points C, c, lying on the same side of P, are as the distances of these points from the end B. In like manner the strains on E and e are as EA and eA.\n\nCor. 2. The strain which a load occasions in the part on which it rests is as the rectangle of the parts on each side. Thus the strain occasioned at C by a load is to that at D by the same load as AC \\(\\times\\) CB to AD \\(\\times\\) DB. It is therefore greatest in the middle.\n\nLet us now consider the strain on any point C arising from a load uniformly distributed along the beam. Letting AP be represented by x, and PB by y, and the whole distributed weight on the beam by a. Then\n\nThe weight on PP is \\( = a \\times \\frac{x}{AB} \\).\nPressure on B by the weight on \\( P \\rho = a \\times \\frac{AB}{\\sqrt{AB}} \\)\n\nOr \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^2}{AB^4} \\).\n\nPressure on B by whole wt. on AC \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^3 \\times BC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nStrain at C by the weight on AC \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^2 \\times BC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nStrain at C by the weight on BC \\( = a \\times \\frac{BC^2 \\times AC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nDw by whole weight on AB \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^2 \\times BC + BC^2 \\times AC}{2AB^2} \\),\n\n\\( = a \\times \\frac{AC \\times BC \\times AC + CB}{2AB^2} \\),\n\n\\( = a \\times \\frac{AC \\times BC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nThus we see that the strain is proportional to the rectangle of the parts, in the same manner as if the load \\( a \\) had been laid directly on the point C, and is indeed equal to one-half of the strain which would be produced at C by the load \\( a \\) laid on there.\n\nIt was necessary to be thus particular, because we see in some elementary treatises of mechanics, published by authors of reputation, mistakes which are very plausible, and mislead the learner. It is there said, that the pressure at B from a weight uniformly diffused along AB is the same as if it were collected at its centre of gravity, which would be the middle of AB; and then the strain at C is said to be this pressure at B multiplied by BC. But surely it is not difficult to see the difference of these strains. It is plain that the pressure of gravity downwards on any point between the end A and the point C has no tendency to diminish the strain at C, arising from the upward reaction of the prop B; whereas the pressure of gravity between C and B is almost in direct opposition to it, and must diminish it. We may however avoid the fluxionary calculus with safety by the consideration of the centre of gravity, by supposing the weights of AC and BC to be collected at their respective centres of gravity; and the result of this computation will be the same as above; and we may use either method, although the weight is not uniformly distributed, provided only that we know in what manner it is distributed.\n\nThis investigation is evidently of importance in the practice of the engineer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, informing them what support is necessary in the different parts of their constructions. We considered some cases of this kind in the article Roofs.\n\nIt is now easy to form a joint, so that it shall have the same relative strength in all its parts.\n\n1. To make it equally able in all its parts to carry a given weight laid on any point C taken at random, or uniformly diffused over the whole length, the strength of the section at the point C must be as AC \\(\\times\\) CB.\n\nTherefore\n\n1. If the sides are parallel vertical planes, the square of the depth (which is the only variable dimension) or CD\\(^2\\), must be as AC \\(\\times\\) CB, and the depths must be ordinates of an ellipse.\n\n2. If the transverse sections are similar, we must make CD\\(^3\\) as AC \\(\\times\\) CB.\n\n3. If the upper and under surfaces are parallel, the breadth must be as AC \\(\\times\\) CB.\n\nII. If the beam is necessarily loaded at some given point C, and we would have the beam equally able in all its parts to resist the strain arising from the weight at C, we must make the strength of every transverse section between C and either end as its distance from that end. Therefore\n\n1. If the sides are parallel vertical planes, we must make CD\\(^3\\) : EF\\(^3\\) = AC : AE.\n\n2. If the sections are similar, then CD\\(^3\\) : EF\\(^3\\) = AC : AE.\n\n3. If the upper and under surfaces are parallel, then, breadth at C : breadth at E = AC : AE.\n\nThe same principles enable us to determine the strain and strength of square or circular plates, of different extent, but equal thicknesses. This may be comprehended in this general proposition.\n\nSimilar plates of equal thickness supported all round will carry the same absolute weight, uniformly distributed, or resting on similar points, whatever is their extent, but of equal thicknesses.\n\nSuppose two similar oblong plates of equal thicknesses, L, l, and B, b, let their lengths and breadths be L, l, and B, b, determined by their strength or momentum of cohesion be C, c, and the strains from the weights W, w, be S, s.\n\nSuppose the plates supported at the ends only, and resisting fracture transversely. The strains, being as the weights and lengths, are as WL and w l, but their cohesions are as the breadths; and since they are of equal relative strength, we have WL : w l = B : b, and WLb = w l B and L : l = w B : W b; but since they are of similar shapes L : l = B : b, and therefore w = W.\n\nThe same reasoning holds again when they are also supported along the sides, and therefore holds when they are supported all round (in which case the strength is doubled).\n\nAnd if the plates are of any other figure, such as circles or ellipses, we need only conceive similar rectangles inscribed in them. These are supported all around by the continuity of the plates, and therefore will sustain equal weights; and the same may be said of the segments which lie without them, because the strengths of any similar segments are equal, their lengths being as their breadths.\n\nTherefore the thickness of the bottoms of vessels holding heavy liquors or grains should be as their diameters, and as the square root of their depths jointly.\n\nAlso the weight which a square plate will bear is to that which a bar of the same matter and thickness will bear as twice the length of the bar to its breadth.\n\nThere is yet another modification of the strain which tends to break a body transversely, which is of very frequent occurrence, and in some cases must be very carefully attended to, viz. the strain arising from its own weight.\n\nWhen a beam projects from a wall, every section is strained by the weight of all that projects beyond it. This may be considered as all collected at its centre of gravity. Therefore the strain on any section is in the joint ratio of the weight of what projects beyond it, and the distance of its centre of gravity from the section.\n\nThe determination of this strain and of the strength necessary for withstanding it must be more complicated than the former, because the form of the piece which results from this adjustment of strain and strength influ-\nThe general principle must evidently be, that the strength or momentum of cohesion of every section must be as the product of the weight beyond it multiplied by the distance of its centre of gravity. For example:\n\nSuppose the beam DLA (fig. 21.) to project from the wall, and that its sides are parallel vertical planes, so that the depth is the only variable dimension. Let \\( LB = x \\) and \\( Bb = y \\). The element \\( BbC \\) is \\( yx \\).\n\nLet \\( G \\) be the centre of gravity of the part lying without \\( Bb \\), and \\( g \\) be its distance from the extremity \\( L \\). Then \\( x - g \\) is the arm of the lever by which the strain is excited in the section \\( Bb \\). Let \\( Bb \\) or \\( y \\) be some power \\( m \\) of \\( LB \\); that is, let \\( y = xm \\). Then the contents of \\( LBb \\) is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\). The momentum of gravity round a horizontal axis at \\( L \\) is \\( yx = \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\), and the whole momentum round the axis is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\). The distance of the centre of gravity from \\( L \\) is had by dividing this momentum by the whole weight which is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\). The quotient or \\( g \\) is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\). And the distance of the centre of gravity from the section \\( Bb \\) is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\).\n\nTherefore the strain on the section \\( Bb \\) is had by multiplying \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\) by \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\). The product is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\times \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\). This must be as the square of the depth, or as \\( y^2 \\). But \\( y \\) is as \\( xm \\), and \\( y^2 \\) as \\( x^2m \\). Therefore we have \\( m + 2 = 2m \\), and \\( m = 2 \\); that is, the depth must be as the square of the distance from the extremity, and the curve \\( LbA \\) is a parabola touching the horizontal line in \\( L \\).\n\nIt is easy to see that a conoid formed by the rotation of this figure round \\( DL \\) will also be equally able in every section to bear its own weight.\n\nWe need not prosecute this farther. When the figure of the piece is given, there is no difficulty in finding the strain; and the circumstance of equal strength to resist this strain is chiefly a matter of curiosity.\n\nIt is evident, from what has been already said, that a projecting beam becomes less able to bear its own weight, as it projects farther. Whatever may be the strength of the section \\( DA \\), the length may be such that it will break by its own weight. If we suppose two beams \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) of the same substance and similar shapes, that is, having their lengths and diameters in the same proportion; and farther suppose that the shorter can just bear its own weight; then the longer beam will not be able to do the same: For the strengths of the sections are as the cubes of the diameters, while the strains are as the biquadrates of the diameters; because the weights are as the cubes, and the levers by which these weights act in producing the strain are as the lengths or as the diameters.\n\nThese considerations show us, that in all cases where strain is affected by the weight of the parts of the machine or structure of any kind, the smaller bodies are more able to withstand it than the greater; and therefore seems to be bounds set by nature to the size of machines constructed of any given materials. Even when the weight of the parts of the machine is not taken into account, we cannot enlarge them in the same proportion as more in all their parts. Thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">steam-engine</a> cannot be doubled able to in all its parts, so as to be still efficient. The pressure on the piston is quadrupled. If the lift of the pump be also produced doubled in height while it is doubled in diameter, then the load will be increased eight times, and will therefore exceed the power. The depth of lift, therefore, must remain unchanged; and in this case the machine will be of the same relative strength as before, independent of its own weight. For the beam being doubled in all its dimensions, its momentum of cohesion is eight times greater, which is again a balance for a quadruple load acting by a double lever.\u2014But if we now consider the increase of the weight of the machine itself, which must be supported, and which must be put in motion by the intervention of its cohesion, we see that the large machine is weaker and less efficient than the small one.\n\nThere is a similar limit set by nature to the size of plants and animals formed of the same matter. The cohesion of an herb could not support it if it were increased to the size of a tree, nor could an oak support itself if 40 or 50 times bigger, nor could an animal of the make of a long-legged spider be increased to the size of a man; the articulations of its legs could not support it.\n\nHence may be understood the prodigious superiority even of the small animals both in strength and agility. Animals are man by falling twice his own height may break his firm bones. A mouse may fall 20 times its height without risk; and even the tender mite or wood-louse may fall unhurt from the top of a steeple. But their greatest superiority is in respect of nimbleness and agility. A flea can leap above 500 times its own length, while the strength of the human muscles could not raise the trunk from the ground on limbs of the same construction.\n\nThe angular motions of small animals (in which consists their nimbleness or agility) must be greater than those of large animals, supposing the force of the muscular fibre to be the same in both. For supposing them similar, the number of equal fibres will be as the square of their linear dimensions; and the levers by which they act are as their linear dimensions. The energy therefore of the moving force is as the cube of these dimensions. But the momentum of inertia, or \\( \\int p \\cdot r^3 \\), is as the 4th power: Therefore the angular velocity of the greater animals is smaller. The number of strokes which a fly makes with its wings in a second is astonishingly great; yet, being voluntary, they are the effects of its agility.\n\nWe have hitherto confined our attention to the simplest form in which this transverse strain can be produced. This was quite sufficient for showing us the mechanism of nature by which the strain is resisted; and a very slight attention is sufficient for enabling us to reduce to this every other way in which the strain can be produced. We shall not take up the reader's time with the application of the same principles to other cases of this strain, but refer him to what has been said in the article ROOF. In that article we have shown the analogy between the strain on the section of a beam projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and the strain...\nStrength of strain on the same section of a beam simply resting on supports at the ends, and loaded at some intermediate point or points. The strain on the middle C of a beam AB (fig. 22.) so supported, arising from a weight laid there, is the same with the strain which half that weight hanging at B would produce on the same section C if the other end of the beam were fixed in a wall. If therefore 1000 pounds hung on the end of a beam projecting 10 feet from a wall will just break it at the wall, it will require 4000 pounds on its middle to break the same beam resting on two props 10 feet asunder. We have also shown in that article the additional strength which will be given to this beam by extending both ends beyond the props, and there framing it firmly into other pillars or supports. We can hardly add anything to what has been said in that article, except a few observations on the effects of the obliquity of the external force. We have hitherto supposed it to act in the direction BP (fig. 8.) perpendicular to the length of the beam. Suppose it to act in the direction BP', oblique to BA. In the article Roofs we supposed the strain to be the same as if the force p acted at the distance AB'; but still perpendicular to AB; so it is. But the strength of the section AD is not the same in both cases; for by the obliquity of the action the piece DCKA is preffed to the other. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the corpufcular forces to say precisely what will be the effect of the pressure arising from this obliquity; but we can clearly see, in general, that the point A, which in the instant of fracture is neither stretched nor comprifhed, must now be farther up, or nearer to D; and therefore the number of particles which are exerting cohesive forces is smaller, and therefore the strength is diminished. Therefore, when we endeavour to proportion the strength of a beam to the strain arising from an external force acting obliquely, we make too liberal allowance by increasing this external force in the ratio of AB to AB'. We acknowledge our inability to affign the proper correction. But this circumstance is of very great influence. In many machines, and many framings of carpentry, this oblique action of the straining force is unavoidable; and the most enormous strains to which materials are exposed are generally of this kind. In the frames set up for carrying the ringstones of arches, it is hardly possible to avoid them: for although the judicious engineer difposes his beams so as to sustain only pressures in the direction of their lengths, tending either to crush them or to tear them asunder, it frequently happens that, by the settling of the work, the pieces come to check and bear on each other transversely, tending to break each other across. This we have remarked upon in the article Roofs, with respect to a truss by Mr Price (see Roofs, No. 40, 41, 45). Now when a cross strain is thus combined with an enormous pressure in the direction of the length of the beam, it is in the utmost danger of snapping suddenly across. This is one great cause of the carrying away of masts. They are comprifhed in the direction of their length by the united force of the shrouds, and in this state the transverse action of the wind soon completes the fracture.\n\nWhen considering the compressing strains to which columns are exposed, we deferred the discussion of the strain on columns, observing that it was not, in the cases which usually occur, a simple compression, but was combined with a transverse strain, arising from the bending of the column. When the column ACB (fig. 23.) rests on the ground at B, and loaded at top with a weight A, acting in the vertical direction AB, is bent into a curve ACB, so that the tangent at C is perpendicular to the horizon, its condition somewhat resembles that of a beam firmly fixed between B and C, and strongly pulled by the end A, so as to bend it between C and A. Although we cannot conceive how a force acting on a straight column AB in the direction AB can bend it, we may suppose that the force acted first in the horizontal direction Ab till it was bent to this degree, and that the rope was then gradually removed from the direction Ab to the direction AB, increasing the force as much as is necessary for preserving the same quantity of flexure.\n\nThe first author (we believe) who considered this important subject with scrupulous attention was the celebrated Euler, who published in the Berlin Memoirs for 1757 his Theory of the Strength of Columns. The strength of general proposition established by this theory is, that the strength of prismatical columns is in the direct quadruplicate ratio of their diameters, and the inverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> ratio of their lengths. He prosecuted this subject in the Peterburgh Commentaries for 1778, confirming his former theory. We do not find that any other author has bestowed much attention on it, all seeming to acquiesce in the determinations of Euler, and to consider the subject as of very great difficulty, requiring the application of the most refined mathematics. Mulchenbroek has compared the theory with experiment; but the comparison has been very unsatisfactory, the difference from the theory being so enormous as to afford no argument for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>. But the experiments do not contradict it, for they are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANOMALOUS\">anomalous</a> as to afford no conclusion or general rule whatever.\n\nTo say the truth, the theory can be considered in no other light than as a specimen of ingenious and very artful algebraic analysis. Euler was unquestionably the first analyst in Europe for resource and address. He knew this, and enjoyed his superiority, and without scruple admitted any physical assumptions which gave him an opportunity of displaying his skill. The insufficiency of his assumptions with the known laws of mechanism gave him no concern; and when his algebraic processes led him to any conclusion which would make his readers stare, being contrary to all our usual notions, he frankly owned the paradox, but went on in his analysis, saying, \"Sed analysi magis fidendum.\" Mr Robins has given some very rife instances of this confidence in his analysis, or rather of his confidence in the indolent submission of his readers. Nay, so fond was he of this kind of amusement, that after having published an untenable Theory of Light and Colours, he published several Memoirs, explaining the aberration of the heavenly bodies, and deducing some very wonderful consequences, fully confirmed by experience, from the Newtonian principles, which were opposite and totally inconsistent with his own theory, merely because the Newtonian theory gave him \"occasionem analyseos promovendi.\" We are thus severe in our observations, because his theory of the strength of columns is one of the strongest instances of this wanton kind of proceeding, and because his followers in the Academy of St Peterburgh, such as Mr Fuss, Lexell, and others, adopt his conclusions, and merely echo his words. Since the death of Daniel Bernoulli\nStrength of Bernoulli no member of that academy has controverted any thing advanced by their Professor jubilis geometriae, to whom they had been indebted for their places and for all their knowledge, having been (most of them) his amanuenses, employed by this wonderful man during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a> to make his computations and carry on his algebraic investigations. We are not a little surprised to see Mr Emeron, a considerable mathematician, and a man of very independent spirit, hastily adopting the same theory, of which we doubt not but our readers will easily see the fallacy.\n\nEuler considers the column ACB as in a condition precisely similar to that of an elastic rod bent into the curve by a cord AB connecting its extremities.\u2014In this he is not mistaken.\u2014But he then draws CD perpendicular to AB, and considers the strain on the section C as equal to the momentum or mechanical energy of the weight A acting in the direction DB upon the lever zcD, moveable round the fulcrum c, and tending to tear asunder the particles which cohere along the section cCz. This is the same principle (as Euler admits) employed by James Bernoulli in his investigation of the elastic curve ACB. Euler considers the strain on the section c as the same with what it would sustain if the same power acted in the horizontal direction EF on a point E as far removed from C as the point D is. We reasoned in the same manner (as has been observed) in the article Roofs, where the obliquity of action was inconsiderable. But in the present case, this substitution leads to the greatest mistakes, and has rendered the whole of this theory false and useless. It would be just if the column were of materials which are incompreensible. But it is evident, by what has been said above, that by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of the parts the real fulcrum of the lever shifts away from the point c, so much the more as the comprehension is greater. In the great comprehensions of loaded columns, and the almost unmeasurable comprehensions of the truss beams in the centres of bridges, and other cases of chief importance, the fulcrum is shifted far over towards x, so that very few fibres resist the fracture by their cohesion; and these few have a very feeble energy or momentum, on account of the short arm of the lever by which they act. This is a most important consideration in carpentry, yet makes no element of Euler's theory. The consequence of this is, that a very small degree of curvature is sufficient to cause the column or strut to snap in an instant, as is well known to every experienced carpenter. The experiment by Muffenbrock, which Euler makes use of in order to obtain a measure of strength in a particular instance, from which he might deduce all others by his theorem, is an incontestable proof of this. The force which broke the column is not the twentieth part of what is necessary for breaking it by acting at E in the direction EF. Euler takes no notice of this immense discrepancy, because it must have caused him to abandon the speculation with which he was then amusing himself.\n\nThe limits of this work do not afford room to enter minutely upon the refutation of this theory; but we can easily show its uselessness, by its total inconsistency with common observation. It results legitimately from this theory, that if CD have no magnitude, the weight A can have no momentum, and the column cannot be broken\u2014True,\u2014it cannot be broken in this way, snapped by a transverse fracture, if it do not bend; but we know very well that it can be crushed or crippled, and we see this frequently happen. This circumstance or event does not enter into Euler's investigation, and therefore the theory is imperfect at least and useless. Had this crippling been introduced in the form of a physical assumption, every topic of reasoning employed in the process must have been laid aside, as the intelligent reader will easily see. But the theory is not only imperfect, but false. The ordinary reader will be convinced of this by another legitimate consequence of it. Fig. 24. is the same Fig. 24., with fig. 106 of Emeron's Mechanics, where this subject is treated on Euler's principles, and represents a crooked piece of matter resting on the ground at F, and loaded at A with a weight acting in the vertical direction AF. It results from Euler's theory that the strains at b, B, D, E, &c. are as b, BC, DI, EK, &c. Therefore the strains at G and H are nothing; and this is affirmed by Emeron and Euler as a serious truth; and the piece may be thinned ad infinitum in these two places, or even cut through, without any diminution of its strength. The absurdity of this assertion strikes at first hearing. Euler affirms the same thing with respect to a point of contrary flexure. Farther discussion is (we apprehend) needless.\n\nThis theory must therefore be given up. Yet these Yet Euler's dissertations of Euler in the Peterburgh Commentaries deserve a perusal, both as very ingenious specimens of analysis, and because they contain maxims of practice which are important. Although they give an erroneous measure of the comparative strength of columns, they show the immense importance of preventing all bendings, and point out with accuracy where the tendencies to bend are greatest, and how this may be prevented by very small forces, and what a prodigious accession of force this gives the column. There is a valuable paper in the same volume by Fuls on the Strains on framed Carpentry, which may also be read with advantage.\n\nIt will now be asked, what shall be substituted in place of this erroneous theory? what is the true proportion of the strength of columns? We acknowledge our inability to give a satisfactory answer. Such can be obtained only by a previous knowledge of the proportion between the extensions and comprehensions produced by equal forces, by the knowledge of the absolute comprehensions producible by a given force, and by a knowledge of the degree of that derangement of parts which is termed crip-pling. These circumstances are but imperfectly known to us, and there lies before us a wide field of experimental inquiry. Fortunately the force requisite for crippling a beam is prodigious, and a very small lateral support is sufficient to prevent that bending which puts the beam in imminent danger. A judicious engineer will always employ transverse bristles, as they are called, to stay the middle of long beams, which are employed as pillars, struts, or truss beams, and are exposed, by their position, to enormous pressures in the direction of their lengths. Such stays may be observed, disposed with great judgement and economy, in the centres employed by Mr Perronet in the erection of his great stone arches. He was obliged to correct this omission made by his ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> in the beautiful centres of the bridge of Orleans, which we have no hesitation in affirming to be the finest piece of carpentry in the world.\nIt only remains on this head to compare these theoretical deductions with experiment.\n\nExperiments on the transverse strength of bodies are easily made, and accordingly are very numerous, especially those made on timber, which is the case most common and most interesting. But in this great number of experiments there are very few from which we can draw much practical information. The experiments have in general been made on such small scantlings, that the unavoidable natural inequalities bear too great a proportion to the strength of the whole piece. Accordingly, when we compare the experiments of different authors, we find them differ enormously, and even the experiments by the same author are very anomalous. The completest series that we have yet seen is that detailed by Belidor in his *Science des Ingenieurs*. They are contained in the following table. The pieces were found, even-grained oak. The column \\( b \\) contains the breadths of the pieces in inches; the column \\( d \\) contains their depths; the column \\( l \\) contains their lengths; column \\( p \\) contains the weights (in pounds) which broke them when hung on their middles; and \\( m \\) is the column of averages or mediums.\n\n| No | b | d | l | p | m |\n|----|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1  | 1 | 18| 400| 406| 405|\n| 2  | 1 | 18| 600| 608| 624|\n| 3  | 2 | 18| 795| 805| 812|\n| 4  | 1 | 18| 1570| 1580| 1590|\n| 5  | 1 | 36| 185| 195| 187|\n| 6  | 1 | 36| 285| 280| 283|\n| 7  | 2 | 36| 1550| 1585| 1585|\n| 8  | 2 | 36| 1665| 1660| 1640|\n\nThe ends lying loose.\n\nThe ends firmly fixed.\n\nLoose.\n\nFixed.\n\nLoose.\n\nBy comparing Experiments 1st and 3d, the strength appears proportional to the breadth.\n\nExperiments 3d and 4th shew the strength proportional to the square of the depth.\n\nExperiments 1st and 5th shew the strength nearly in the inverse proportion of the lengths, but with a sensible deficiency in the longer pieces.\n\nExperiments 5th and 7th shew the strengths proportional to the breadths and the square of the depth.\n\nExperiments 1st and 7th shew the same thing, compounded with the inverse proportion of the length: the deficiency relative to the length is not so remarkable here.\n\nExperiments 1st and 2d, and experiments 5th and 6th shew the increase of strength, by fastening the ends, to be in the proportion of 2 to 3. The theory gives the proportion of 2 to 4. But a difference in the manner of fixing may produce this deviation from the theory, which only supposed them to be held down at places beyond the props, as when a joist is held in the walls, and also rests on two pillars between the walls. (See what is said on this subject in the article Roof, \u00a7 19.) where note, that there is a mistake, when it is said that a beam supported at both ends and loaded in the middle, will carry twice as much as if one end were fixed in the wall and the weight suspended at the other end. The reasoning employed there shows that it will carry four times as much.\n\nThe chief source of irregularity in such experiments is the fibrous, or rather plated texture of timber. It consists of annual additions, whose cohesion with each other is vastly weaker than that of their own fibres. Let fig. 25 represent the section of a tree, and ABCD, Fig. 25, \\( a b c d \\) the section of two battens that are to be cut out of it for experiment, and let AD and \\( a d \\) be the depths, and DC, \\( d c \\) the breadths. The batten ABCD will be the strongest, for the same reason that an assemblage of planks set edgewise will form a stronger joist than planks laid above each other like the plates of a coach-spring. M. Buffon found by many trials that the strength of ABCD was to that of \\( a b c d \\) (in oak) nearly as 8 to 7. The authors of the different experiments were not careful that their battens had their plates all disposed similarly with respect to the strain. But even with this precaution they would not have afforded sure grounds of computation for large works; for great beams occupy much, if not the whole, of the section of the tree; and from this it has happened that their strength is less than in proportion to that of a small lath or batten. In short, we can trust no experiments but such as have been made on large beams. These must be very rare, for they are most expensive and laborious, and exceed the abilities of most of those who are disposed to study this matter.\n\nBut we are not wholly without such authority. M. Buffon and M. Du Hamel, two of the first philosophers and mechanicians of the age, were directed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to make experiments on this subject, and were supplied with ample funds and apparatus. The relation of their experiments is to be found in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1740, 1741, 1742, 1768; as also in Du Hamel's valuable performances sur l'Exploitation des Arbres, et sur la Conservation et le Transport de Bois. We earnestly recommend these dissertations to the perusal of our readers, as containing much useful information relative to the strength of timber, and the best methods of employing it. We shall here give an abstract of M. Buffon's experiments.\nHe relates a great number which he had prosecuted during two years on small battens. He found that the odds of a single layer, or part of a layer, more or less, or even a different disposition of them, had such influence that he was obliged to abandon this method, and to have recourse to the largest beams that he was able to break. The following table exhibits one series of experiments on bars of sound oak, clear of knots, and four inches square. This is a specimen of all the rest.\n\nColumn 1st is the length of the bar in clear feet between the supports.\n\nColumn 2d is the weight of the bar (the 2d day after it was felled) in pounds. Two bars were tried of each length. Each of the first three pairs consisted of two cuts of the same tree. The one next the root was always found the heaviest, stiffest, and strongest. Indeed Mr. Buffon says that this was invariably true, that the heaviest was always the strongest; and he recommends it as certain (or sure) rule for the choice of timber. He finds that this is always the case when the timber has grown vigorously, forming very thick annual layers. But he also observes that this is only during the advances of the tree to maturity; for the strength of the different circles approaches gradually to equality during the tree's healthy growth, and then it decays in these parts in a contrary order. Our tool-makers assert the same thing with respect to beech; yet a contrary opinion is very prevalent; and wood with a fine, that is, a small grain, is frequently preferred. Perhaps no person has ever made the trial with such minuteness as Mr. Buffon, and we think that much deference is due to his opinion.\n\nColumn 3d is the number of pounds necessary for breaking the tree in the course of a few minutes.\n\nColumn 4th is the inches which it bent down before breaking.\n\nColumn 5th is the time at which it broke.\n\n|   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |\n|---|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 7 | 60 | 5350 | 3-5 | 29 |\n|   | 56 | 5275 | 4-5 | 22 |\n| 8 | 68 | 4600 | 3-75 | 15 |\n|   | 63 | 4500 | 4-7 | 13 |\n| 9 | 77 | 4100 | 4-85 | 14 |\n|   | 71 | 3950 | 5-5 | 12 |\n| 10| 84 | 3625 | 5-83 | 15 |\n|   | 82 | 3600 | 6-5 | 15 |\n| 12| 100 | 3050 | 7. |\n\nThe experiments on other sizes were made in the same way. A pair at least of each length and size was taken. The mean results are contained in the following table. The beams were all square, and their sizes in inches are placed at the head of the columns, and their lengths in feet are in the first column.\n\nM. Buffon had found by numerous trials that oak-timber lost much of its strength in the course of drying or seasoning; and therefore, in order to secure uniformity, his trees were all felled in the same season of the year, were squared the day after, and tried the third day. Trying them in this green state, gave him an opportunity of observing a very curious and unaccountable phenomenon. When the weights were laid briskly on, nearly sufficient to break the log, a very sensible smoke was observed to issue from the two ends with a sharp hissing noise. This continued all the while the tree was bending and cracking. This shows that the log is affected or strained through its whole length; indeed this must be inferred from its bending through its whole length. It also shows us the great effects of the compression. It is a pity M. Buffon did not take notice whether this smoke issued from the upper or compressed half of the section only, or whether it came from the whole.\n\nWe must now make some observations on these experiments, in order to compare them with the theory which we have endeavoured to establish.\n\nM. Buffon considers the experiments with the 5-inch bars as the standard of comparison, having both extended these to greater lengths, and having tried more pieces of each length.\n\nOur theory determines the relative strength of bars of the same section to be inversely as their lengths. But (if we except the five experiments in the first column) we find a very great deviation from this rule. Thus the 5-inch bar of 28 feet long should have half the strength of that of 14 feet, or 2650; whereas it is but 1775. The bar of 14 feet should have half the strength of that of 7 feet, or 5762; whereas it is but 5300. In like manner, the fourth of 11525 is 2881; but the real strength of the 28 feet bar is 1775. We have added a column A, which exhibits the strength which each of the 5-inch bars ought to have by the theory. This deviation is most distinctly seen in fig. 26, where BK is the scale of lengths, B being at the point 7 of the scale, and K at 28. The ordinate CB is = 11525, and the other ordinates DE, GK, &c. are respectively = \\(\\frac{7}{\\text{Length}}\\).\n\nThe lines DF, GH, &c. are made = 4350, 1775, &c., expressing the strengths given by experiment. The 10 feet bar and the 24 feet bar are remarkably anomalous. But all are deficient, and the defect has an evident progression from the first to the last. The same thing may be\nStrength of be shown of the other columns, and even of the first, though it is very small in that column. It may also be observed in the experiments of Belidor, and in all that we have seen. We cannot doubt therefore of its being a law of nature, depending on the true principles of cohesion, and the laws of mechanics.\n\nBut it is very puzzling, and we cannot pretend to give a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty. The only effect which we can conceive the length of a beam to have, is to increase the strain at the section of fracture by employing the intervening beam as a lever. But we do not distinctly see what change this can produce in the mode of action of the fibres in this section, so as either to change their cohesion or the place of its centre of effort: yet something of this kind must happen.\n\nWe see indeed some circumstances which must contribute to make a smaller weight sufficient, in Mr Buffon's experiments, to break a long beam, than in the exact inverse proportion of its length.\n\nIn the first place, the weight of the beam itself augments the strain as much as if half of it were added in form of a weight. Mr Buffon has given the weights of every beam on which he made experiments, which is very nearly 74 pounds per cubic foot. But they are much too small to account for the deviation from the theory. The half weights of the 5-inch beams of 7, 14, and 28 feet length are only 45, 92, and 182 pounds; which makes the real strains in the experiments 11560, 5390, and 1956; which are far from having the proportions of 4, 2, and 1.\n\nBuffon says that healthy trees are universally strongest at the root end; therefore, when we use a longer beam, its middle point, where it is broken in the experiment, is in a weaker part of the tree. But the trials of the 4-inch beams show that the difference from this cause is almost insensible.\n\nThe length must have some mechanical influence which the theory we have adopted has not yet explained. It may not however be inadequate to the task. The very ingenious investigation of the elastic curve by James Bernoulli and other celebrated mathematicians is perhaps as refined an application of mathematical analysis as we know. Yet in this investigation it was necessary, in order to avoid almost insuperable difficulties, to take the simplest possible case, viz. where the thickness is exceedingly small in comparison with the length. If the thickness be considerable, the quantities neglected in the calculus are too great to permit the conclusion to be accurate, or very nearly so. Without being able to define the form into which an elastic body of considerable thickness will be bent, we can say with confidence, that in an extreme case, where the compression in the concave side is very great, the curvature differs considerably from the Bernoullian curve. But as our investigation is incomplete and very long, we do not offer it to the reader. The following more familiar considerations will, we apprehend, render it highly probable that the relative strength of beams decreases faster than in the inverse ratio of their length. The curious observation by Mr Buffon of the vapour which issued with a hissing noise from the ends of a beam of green oak, while it was breaking by the load on its middle, shows that the whole length of the piece was affected: indeed it must be, since it is bent throughout. We have shown above, that a certain definite curvature of a beam of a given form is always accompanied by rupture. Now suppose the beam Strength of A of 10 feet long, and the beam B of 20 feet long, bent to the same degree, at the place of their fixture in the wall; the weight which hangs on A is nearly double of that which must hang on B. The form of any portion, suppose 5 feet, of these two beams, immediately adjoining to the wall, is considerably different. At the distance of 5 feet the curvature of A is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of its curvature at the wall. The curvature of B in the corresponding point is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)ths of the same curvature at the wall. Through the whole of the intermediate 5 feet, therefore, the curvature of B is greater than that of A. This must make it weaker throughout. It must occasion the fibres to slide more on each other (that it may acquire this greater curvature), and thus affect their lateral union; and therefore those which are stronger will not assist their weaker neighbours. To this we must add, that in the shorter beams the force with which the fibres are pressed laterally on each other is double. This must impede the mutual sliding of the fibres which we mentioned a little ago; nay, this lateral compression may change the law of longitudinal cohesion (as will readily appear to the reader who is acquainted with Bozovic's doctrines), and increase the strength of the very surface of fracture, in the same way (however inexplicable) as it does in metals when they are hammered or drawn into wire.\n\nThe reader must judge how far these remarks are worthy of his attention. The engineer will carefully keep in mind the important fact, that a beam of quadruple length, instead of having \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the strength, has only about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th; and the philosopher should endeavour to discover the cause of this diminution, that he may give the artist a more accurate rule of computation.\n\nOur ignorance of the law by which the cohesion of the particles changes by a change of distance, hinders us from discovering the precise relation between the curvature and the momentum of cohesion; and all we can do between the two is to multiply experiments, upon which we may establish some empirical rules for calculating the strength of solids, and the momenta of which we must reason at present are too few and too anomalous to be the foundation of such an empirical formula. We may, however, observe, that Mr Buffon's experiments give us considerable assistance in this particular: For if to each of the numbers of the column for the 5-inch beams, corrected by adding half the weight of the beam, we add the constant number 1245, we shall have a set of numbers which are very nearly reciprocals of the lengths. Let 1245 be called c, and let the weight which is known by experiment to be necessary for breaking the 5-inch beam of the length a be called P. We shall have \\( \\frac{P + c \\times a}{l} = p \\). Thus the weight necessary for breaking the 7-foot bar is 11560. This added to 1245, and the sum multiplied by 7, gives \\( \\frac{89635}{18} = 1245 \\). Let l be 18; then \\( \\frac{89635}{18} = 3725 \\); \\( \\frac{3725}{p} \\), which differs not more than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th from what experiment gives us. This rule holds equally well in all the other lengths except the 10 and 24 foot beams, which are very anomalous. Such a formula is abundantly exact for practice, and will answer through a much greater variety of length, though it cannot be admitted as a true one; because, in a certain very great length,\nStrength of length, the strength will be nothing. For other sizes\nthe constant number must change in the proportion of\n\\(d^2\\), or perhaps of \\(f\\).\n\nRelation between the strength and the square of the depth of the section. This is made by comparing each other the numbers in any horizontal line of the table. In making this comparison we find the numbers of the five-inch bars uniformly greater than the rest. We imagine that there is something peculiar to these bars: They are in general heavier than in the proportion of their section, but not to such an extent as to account for all their superiority. We imagine that this set of experiments, intended as a standard for the rest, has been made at one time, and that the season has had a considerable influence. The fact however is, that if this column be kept out, or uniformly diminished about one-sixteenth in their strength, the different sizes will deviate very little from the ratio of the square of the depth, as determined by theory. There is however a small deficiency in the bigger beams.\n\nWe have been thus anxious in the examination of these experiments, because they are the only ones which have been related in sufficient detail, and made on a proper scale for giving us data from which we can deduce confidential maxims for practice. They are too troublesome and expensive that we have little hopes of seeing their number greatly increased; yet surely our navy board would do an unspeakable service to the public by appropriating a fund for such experiments under the management of some man of science.\n\nThere remains another comparison which is of chief importance, namely, the proportion between the absolute cohesion and the relative strength. It may be guessed, from the very nature of the thing, that this must be very uncertain. Experiments on the absolute strength must be confined to very small pieces, by reason of the very great forces which are required for tearing them asunder. The values therefore deduced from them must be subject to great inequalities. Unfortunately we have got no detail of any experiments; all that we have to depend on is two passages of Mulchenbrock's \u00c9tats de Physique, in one of which he says that a piece of found oak \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches thick of an inch square is torn asunder by 1150 pounds; and in the other, that an oak plank 12 inches broad and one thick will just suspend 189163 pounds. These give for the cohesion of an inch square 15755 and 15763 pounds. Bouguer, in his Trait\u00e9 du Navire, says that it is very well known that a rod of found oak one fourth of an inch square will be torn asunder by 1000 pounds. This gives 16000 for the cohesion of a square inch. We shall take this as a round number, easily used in our computations. Let us compare this with M. Buffon's trials of beams four inches square.\n\nThe absolute cohesion of this section is 16000 \\(\\times\\) 16 = 256000. Did every fibre exert its whole force in the instant of fracture, the momentum of cohesion would be the same as if it had all acted at the centre of gravity of the section at 2 inches from the axis of fracture, and is therefore 512000. The 4-inch beam, 7 feet long, was broken by 5312 pounds hung on its middle. The half of this, or 2656 pounds, would have broken it, if suspended at its extremity, projecting 3\u00bd feet, or 42 inches from a wall. The momentum of this strain is therefore 2656 \\(\\times\\) 42 = 111552. Now this is in equilibrium with the actual momentum of cohesion, which is therefore 111552 instead of 512000. The strength is therefore diminished in the proportion of 512000 to 111552, or very nearly of 4:59 to 1.\n\nAs we are quite uncertain as to the place of the centre of effort, it is needless to consider the full cohesion as acting at the centre of gravity, and producing the momentum 512000; and we may convert the whole into a simple multiplier \\(m\\) of the length, and say, as \\(m\\) times the length is to the depth, so is the absolute cohesion of the section to the relative strength. Therefore let the absolute cohesion of a square inch be called \\(f\\), the breadth \\(b\\), the depth \\(d\\), and the length \\(l\\) (all in inches), the relative strength, or the external force \\(p\\), which balances it, is \\(\\frac{fb}{9l}\\); or in round numbers \\(\\frac{fb}{9l}\\); for \\(m = 2 \\times 4:59\\).\n\nThis great diminution of strength cannot be wholly accounted for by the inequality of the cohesive forces exerted in the instant of fracture; for in this case we know that the centre of effort is at \\(\\frac{1}{3}d\\) of the height in a rectangular section (because the forces really exerted are as the extensions of the fibres). The relative strength would be \\(\\frac{fb}{3l}\\), and \\(p\\) would have been 8127 instead of 2656.\n\nWe must ascribe this diminution (which is three times greater than that produced by the inequality of the cohesive forces) to the compression of the under part of the beam; and we must endeavour to explain in what manner this compression produces an effect which seems so little explicable by such means.\n\nAs we have repeatedly observed, it is a matter of nearly universal experience that the forces actually exerted by the particles of bodies, when stretched or compressed, are very nearly in the proportion of the distances to which the particles are drawn from their natural positions. Now, although we are certain that, in enormous compressions, the forces increase faster than in this proportion, this makes no sensible change in the present question, because the body is broken before the compressions have gone so far; nay, we imagine that the compressed parts are crippled in most cases even before the extended parts are torn asunder. Mulchenbrock affirms this with great confidence with respect to oak, on the authority of his own experiments. He says, that although oak will suspend half as much again as fir, it will not support, as a pillar, two-thirds of the load which fir will support in that form.\n\nWe imagine therefore that the mechanism in the present case is nearly as follows:\n\nLet the beam DCK \\(\\Delta\\) (fig. 27.) be loaded at its extremity with the weight \\(P\\), acting in the direction KP perpendicular to DC. Let DA be the section of fracture. Let DA be about one-third of DA. A will be the particle or fibre which is neither extended nor compressed. Make \\(\\Delta d : Dd = DA : AA\\). The triangles DA', DA' will represent the accumulated attracting and repelling forces. Make AI and AI = DA and \\(\\frac{1}{3}DA\\). The point I will be that to which the full cohesion \\(Dd\\) or \\(f\\) of the particles in AD must be applied, so as to produce the same momentum which the variable forces at I, D, &c. really produce at their several points of\nStrength of application. In like manner, \\( i \\) is the centre of the repulsive forces excited by the compression between \\( A \\) and \\( \\Delta \\), and it is the real fulcrum of a bent lever \\( I K \\), by which the whole effect is produced. The effect is the same as if the full cohesion of the stretched fibres in \\( AD \\) were accumulated in \\( I \\), and the full repulsion of all the compressed fibres in \\( A \\Delta \\) were accumulated in \\( i \\). The forces which are balanced in the operation are the weight \\( P \\), acting by the arm \\( k \\), and the full cohesion of \\( AD \\) acting by the arm \\( I i \\).\n\nThe forces exerted by the compressed fibres between \\( A \\) and \\( \\Delta \\) only serve to give support to the lever, that it may exert its strain.\n\nWe imagine that this does not differ much from the real procedure of nature. The position of the point \\( A \\) may be different from what we have deduced from Mr. Buffon's experiments, compared with Mulchenbroek's value of the absolute cohesion of a square inch. If this last should be only 12000, \\( DA \\) must be greater than we have here made it, in the proportion of 12000 to 16000. For \\( Ii \\) must still be made \\( = \\frac{1}{3} AD \\), supposing the forces to be proportional to the extensions and compressions. There can be no doubt that a part only of the cohesion of \\( DA \\) operates in resisting the fracture in all substances which have any compressibility; and it is confirmed by the experiments of Mr. Du Hamel on willow, and the inferences are by no means confined to that species of timber. We say therefore, that when the beam is broken, the cohesion of \\( AD \\) alone is exerted, and that each fibre exerts a force proportional to its extension; and the accumulated momentum is the same as if the full cohesion of \\( AD \\) were acting by the lever \\( Ii \\).\n\nIt may be said, that if only one-third of the cohesion of oak be exerted, it may be cut two-thirds through without weakening it. But this cannot be, because the cohesion of the whole is employed in preventing the lateral slide so often mentioned. We have no experiments to determine that it may not be cut through one-third without loss of its strength.\n\nThis must not be considered as a subject of mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> curiosity. It is intimately connected with all the practical uses which we can make of this knowledge; for it is almost the only way that we can learn the compressibility of timber. Experiments on the direct cohesion are indeed difficult, and exceedingly expensive if we attempt them in large pieces. But experiments on compression are almost impracticable. The most instructive experiments would be, first to establish, by a great number of trials, the transverse force of a modern batten; and then to make a great number of trials of the diminution of its strength, by cutting it through on the concave side. This would very nearly give us the proportion of the cohesion which really operates in resisting fractures. Thus if it be found that one-half of the beam may be cut on the under side without diminution of its strength (taking care to drive in a slice of harder wood), we may conclude that the point \\( A \\) is at the middle, or somewhat above it.\n\nMuch lies before the curious mechanician, and we are as yet very far from a scientific knowledge of the strength of timber.\n\nIn the mean time, we may derive from these experiments of Buffon a very useful practical rule, without relying on any value of the absolute cohesion of oak. We see that the strength is nearly as the breadth, as the strength of square of the depth, and as the inverse of the length.\n\nIt is most convenient to measure the breadth and depth of the beam in inches, and its length in feet. Since, a useful then, a beam four inches square and seven feet between practical supports is broken by 5312 pounds, we must conclude that a batten one inch square and one foot between supports will be broken by 81 pounds. Then the Buffon's strength of any other beam of oak, or the weight which experiment will just break it when hung on its middle, is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b^2 d^2}{7}\n\\]\n\nBut we have seen that there is a very considerable deviation from the inverse proportion of the lengths, and we must endeavour to accommodate our rule to this deviation. We found, that by adding 1245 to each of the ordinates or numbers in the column of the five-inch bars, we had a set of numbers very nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> of the lengths; and if we make a similar addition to the other columns in the proportion of the cubes of the fixes, we have nearly the same result. The greatest error (except in the case of experiments which are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>) does not exceed \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\)th of the whole. Therefore, for a radical number, add to the 5312 the number 640, which is to 1245 very nearly as 4\\( ^3 \\) to 5\\( ^3 \\). This gives 5952. The 640th of this is 93, which corresponds to a bar of one inch square and seven feet long. Therefore 93\\( ^3 \\times 7 \\) will be the reciprocal corresponding to a bar of one foot. This is 651. Take from this the present empirical correction, which is \\( \\frac{b^2}{b^4} \\), or 10, and there remains 641 for the strength of the bar. This gives us for a general rule\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{b^2 d^2}{7} - 10 b d^2\n\\]\n\nExample. Required the weight necessary to break an oak beam eight inches square and 20 feet between the props, \\( \\rho = 651 \\times \\frac{8 \\times 8^3}{20} = 10 \\times 8 \\times 8^3 \\). This is 11545, whereas the experiment gives 11487. The error is very small indeed. The rule is most deficient in comparison with the five-inch bars, which we have already laid appear stronger than the rest.\n\nThe following proof is easily remembered by such as are not algebraists.\n\nMultiply the breadth in inches twice by the depth, and call this product \\( f \\). Multiply \\( f \\) by 651, and divide by the length in feet. From the quotient take 10 times \\( f \\). The remainder is the number of pounds which will break the beam.\n\nWe are not sufficiently sensible of our principles to be confident that the correction 10\\( f \\) should be in the proportion of the section, although we think it most probable. It is quite empirical, founded on Buffon's experiments. Therefore the safe way of using this rule is to suppose the beam square, by increasing or diminishing its breadth till equal to the depth. Then find the strength by this rule, and diminish or increase it for the change which has been made in its breadth. Thus, there can be no doubt that the strength of the beam given as an example is double of that of a beam of the same depth and half the breadth.\n\nThe reader cannot but observe that all this calculation relates to the very greatest weight which a beam will bear for a very few minutes. Mr. Buffon uniformly found...\nStrength of found that two-thirds of this weight sensibly impaired its strength, and frequently broke it at the end of two or three months. One-half of this weight brought the beam to a certain bend, which did not increase after the first minute or two, and may be borne by the beam for any length of time. But the beam contracted a bend, of which it did not recover any considerable portion. One-third seemed to have no permanent effect on the beam; but it recovered its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> shape completely, even after having been loaded several months, provided that the timber was seasoned when first loaded; that is to say, one-third of the weight which would quickly break a seasoned beam, or one-fourth of what would break one just felled, may lie on it for ever without giving the beam a set.\n\nWe have no detail of experiments on the strength of other kinds of timber: only Mr Buffon says, that fir has about $\\frac{6}{7}$ths of the strength of oak; Mr Parent makes it $\\frac{5}{8}$ths; Emerson, $\\frac{3}{4}$ths, &c.\n\nWe have been thus minute in our examination of the mechanism of this transverse strain, because it is the greatest to which the parts of our machines are exposed. We wish to impress on the minds of artists the necessity of avoiding this as much as possible. They are improving in this respect, as may be seen by comparing the centres on which stone arches of great span are now turned with those of former times. They were formerly a load of mere joints resting on a multitude of posts, which obstructed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, and were frequently losing their shape by some of the posts sinking into the ground. Now they are more generally trusses, where the beams abut on each other, and are relieved from transverse strains. But many performances of eminent artists are still very injudiciously exposed to cross strains. We may instance one which is considered as a fine work, viz. the bridge at Walton on Thames. Here every beam of the great arch is a joint, and it hangs together by framing. The finest piece of carpentry that we have seen is the centre employed in turning the arches of the bridge at Orleans, described by Perronet. In the whole there is not one cross strain. The beam, too, of Hornblower's steam-engine, described in that article, is very scientifically constructed.\n\nIV. The last species of strain which we are to examine is that produced by twisting. This takes place in all axes which connect the working parts of machines.\n\nAlthough we cannot pretend to have a very distinct conception of that modification of the cohesion of a body by which it resists this kind of strain, we can have no doubt that, when all the particles act alike, the resistance must be proportional to the number. Therefore if we suppose the two parts ABCD, ABFE (fig. 28.), of the body EFCD to be of insuperable strength, but cohering more weakly in the common surface AB, and that one part ABCD is pushed laterally in the direction AB, there can be no doubt that it will yield only there, and that the resistance will be proportional to the surface.\n\nIn like manner, we can conceive a thin cylindrical tube, of which KAH (fig. 29.) is the section, as cohering more weakly in that section than anywhere else. Suppose it to be grafted in both hands, and the two parts twisted round the axis in opposite directions, as we would twist the two joints of a flute, it is plain that it will first fail in this section, which is the circumference of a circle, and the particles of the two parts which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to this circumference will be drawn from each other laterally. The total resistance will be as the number of equally resisting particles, that is, as the circumference (for the tube being supposed very thin, there can be no sensible difference between the dilatation of the external and internal particles). We can now suppose another tube within this, and a third within the second, and so on till we reach the centre. If the particles of each ring exerted the same force (by suffering the same dilatation in the direction of the circumference), the resistance of each ring of the section would be as its circumference and its breadth (supposed indefinitely small, and the whole resistance would be as the surface; and this would represent the resistance of a solid cylinder. But when a cylinder is twisted in this manner by an external force applied to its circumference, the external parts will suffer a greater circular extension than the internal; and it appears that this extension (like the extension of a beam strained transversely) will be proportional to the distance of the particles from the axis. We cannot say that this is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRABLE\">demonstrable</a>, but we can assign no proportion that is more probable. This being the case, the forces simultaneously exerted by each particle will be as its distance from the axis. Therefore the whole force exerted by each ring will be as the square of its radius, and the accumulated force actually exerted will be as the cube of the radius; that is, the accumulated force exerted by the whole cylinder, whose radius is CA, is to the accumulated force exerted at the same time by the part whose radius is CE, as CA$^3$ to CE$^3$.\n\nThe whole cohesion now exerted is just two-thirds of what it would be if all the particles were exerting the same attractive forces which are just now exerted by the particles in the external circumference. This is plain to any person in the least familiar with the fluxionary calculus. But such as are not may easily see it in this way.\n\nLet the rectangle AC ca be set upright on the surface of the circle along the line CA, and revolve round the axis Cc. It will generate a cylinder whose height is Cc or Aa, and having the circle KAH for its base. If the diagonal Ca be supposed also to revolve, it is plain that the triangle c Ca will generate a cone of the same height, and having for its base the circle described by the revolution of ca, and the point C for its apex. The cylindrical surface <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by Aa will express the whole cohesion exerted by the circumference AHK, and the cylindrical surface generated by Ec will represent the cohesion exerted by the circumference ELM, and the solid generated by the triangle CAa will represent the cohesion exerted by the whole circle AHK, and the cylinder generated by the rectangle AC ca will represent the cohesion exerted by the same surface if each particle had suffered the extension Aa.\n\nNow it is plain, in the first place, that the solid generated by the triangle Ec is to that generated by a AC as EC$^3$ to AC$^3$. In the next place, the solid generated by a AC is two-thirds of the cylinder, because the cone generated by c Ca is one-third of it.\n\nWe may now suppose the cylinder twisted till the particles in the external circumference lose their cohesion. There can be no doubt that it will now be wrenched asunder, all the inner circles yielding in succession. Thus we obtain one useful information, viz. that a body of homogeneous texture resists a simple twist with two-thirds\nStrength of thirds of the force with which it resists an attempt to force one part laterally from the other, or with one-third part of the force which will cut it asunder by a square-edged tool. For to drive a square-edged tool through a piece of lead, for instance, is the same as forcing a piece of the lead as thick as the tool laterally away from the two pieces on each side of the tool. Experiments of this kind do not seem difficult, and they would give us very useful information.\n\nWhen two cylinders AHK and BNO are wrenched asunder, we must conclude that the external particles of each are just put beyond their limits of cohesion, are equally extended, and are exerting equal forces. Hence it follows, that in the instant of fracture the sum total of the forces actually exerted are as the squares of the diameters.\n\nFor drawing the diagonal Ce, it is plain that Ee = Aa expresses the diffusion of the circumference ELM, and that the solid generated by the triangle Cee expresses the cohesion exerted by the surface of the circle ELM, when the particles in the circumference suffer the extension Ee equal to Aa. Now the solids generated by CAa and Cee being respectively two-thirds of the corresponding cylinders, are as the squares of the diameters.\n\nHaving thus ascertained the real strength of the section, and its relation to its absolute lateral strength, let us examine its strength relative to the external force employed to break it. This examination is very simple in the case under consideration. The straining force must act by some lever, and the cohesion must oppose it by acting on some other lever. The centre of the section may be the neutral point, whose position is not disturbed.\n\nLet F be the force exerted laterally by an exterior particle. Let a be the radius of the cylinder, and x the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> distance of any circumference, and x the indefinitely small interval between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> arches; that is, let x be the breadth of a ring and x its radius. The forces being as the extensions, and the extensions as the distances from the axis, the cohesion actually exerted at any part of any ring will be \\( f \\frac{x}{a} \\). The force exerted by the whole ring (being as the circumference or as the radius) will be \\( f \\frac{x^2}{a} \\). The momentum of cohesion of a ring, being as the force multiplied by its lever, will be \\( f \\frac{x^3}{a} \\). The accumulated momentum will be the sum or fluent of \\( f \\frac{x^3}{a} \\); that is, when \\( x = a \\), it will be \\( \\frac{1}{4} f a^3 \\).\n\nHence we learn that the strength of an axle, by which it resists being wrenched asunder by a force acting at a given distance from the axis, is as the cube of its diameter.\n\nBut farther, \\( \\frac{1}{4} f a^3 \\) is \\( f a^3 \\times \\frac{1}{4} a \\). Now \\( f a^3 \\) represents the full lateral cohesion of the section. The momentum therefore is the same as if the full lateral cohesion were accumulated at a point distant from the axis by one-fourth of the radius or one-eighth of the diameter of the cylinder.\n\nTherefore let F be the number of pounds which measures the lateral cohesion of a circular inch, d the diameter of the cylinder in inches, and l the length of the lever by which the straining force p is supposed to act, we shall have \\( F \\times \\frac{1}{8} d^3 = p l \\), and \\( F \\frac{d^3}{8l} = p \\).\n\nWe see in general that the strength of an axle, by which it resists being wrenched asunder by twisting, is as the cube of its diameter.\n\nWe see also that the internal parts are not acting so powerfully as the external. If a hole be bored out of the axle of half its diameter, the strength is diminished only one-eighth, while the quantity of matter is diminished one-fourth. Therefore hollow axles are stronger than solid ones containing the same quantity of matter. Thus let the diameter be 5 and that of the hollow 4; then Hollow the diameter of another solid cylinder having the same quantity of matter with the tube is 3. The strength of solid ones, the solid cylinder of the diameter 5 may be expressed by \\( \\frac{5^3}{64} = 61 \\). Of this the internal part (of the diameter 4) exerts 64; therefore the strength of the tube is \\( \\frac{125}{64} = 61 \\). But the strength of the solid axle of the same quantity of matter and diameter 3 is \\( \\frac{3^3}{64} = 27 \\), which is not half of that of the tube.\n\nEngineers, therefore, have of late introduced this improvement in their machines, and the axles of cast iron generally are all made hollow when their size will admit it. They used have the additional advantage of being much lighter, and of affording much better fixture for the flanges, which are used for connecting them with the wheels or levers by which they are turned and strained. The superiority of strength of hollow tubes over solid cylinders is much greater in this kind of strain than in the former or transverse. In this last case the strength of this tube would be to that of the solid cylinder of equal weight as 61 to 32 and a half nearly.\n\nThe apparatus which we mentioned on a former occasion for trying the lateral strength of a square inch of solid matter, enabled us to try this theory of twist with all desirable accuracy. The bar which hung down from the pin in the former trials was now placed in a horizontal position, and loaded with a weight at the extremity. Thus it acted as a powerful lever, and enabled the ratio to be wrench asunder specimens of the strongest materials. We found the results perfectly conformable to the theory, in as far as it determined the proportional strength of different sizes and forms; but we found the lateral ratio of the resistance to twisting to the simple lateral resistance distance considerably different; and it was some time before we discovered the cause.\n\nWe had here taken the simplest view that is possible of the action of cohesion in resisting a twist. It is frequently exerted in a very different way. When, for instance, an iron axle is joined to a wooden one by being driven into one end of it, the extensions of the different circles of particles are in a very different proportion. A little consideration will show that the particles in immediate contact with the iron axle are in a state of violent extension; so are the particles of the exterior surface of the wooden part, and the intermediate parts are less strained. It is almost impossible to assign the exact proportion of the cohesive forces exerted in the different parts.\nStrength of parts. Numberless cases can be pointed out where parts of the axle are in a state of compression, and where it is still more difficult to determine the state of the other particles. We must content ourselves with the deductions made from this simple case, which is fortunately the most common. In the experiments just now mentioned the centre of the circle is by no means the neutral point, and it is very difficult to ascertain its place; but when this consideration occurred to us, we easily freed the experiments from this uncertainty, by extending the lever to both sides, and by means of a pulley applied equal force to each arm, acting in opposite directions. Thus the centre became the neutral point, and the resistance to twist was found to be two-thirds of the simple lateral strength.\n\nWe beg leave to mention here that our success in these experiments encouraged us to extend them much farther. We hoped by these means to discover the absolute cohesion of many substances, which would have required an enormous apparatus and a most unmanageable force to tear them asunder directly. But we could reason with confidence from the resistance to twist (which we could easily measure), provided that we could ascertain the proportion of the direct and the lateral strengths. Our experiments on chalk, finely prepared clay, and white bees-wax (of one melting and one temperature), were very consistent and satisfactory. But we have hitherto found great irregularities in this proportion in bodies of a fibrous texture like timber. These are the most important cases, and we still hope to be able to accomplish our project, and to give the public some valuable information. This being our sole object, it was our duty to mention the method which promises success, and thus excite others to the task; and it will be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to us to be deprived of the honour of being the first who thus adds to the stock of experimental knowledge.\n\nWhen the matter of the axle is of the most simple texture, such as that of metals, we do not conceive that the length of the axle has any influence on the fracture. It is otherwise if it be of a fibrous texture like timber: the fibres are bent before breaking, being twisted into spirals like a cork-screw. The length of the axle has somewhat of the influence of a lever in this case, and it is easier wrenched asunder if long. Accordingly we have found it so; but we have not been able to reduce this influence to calculation.\n\nOur readers are requested to accept of these endeavours to communicate information on this important and difficult subject. We are duly sensible of their imperfection, but flatter ourselves that we have in many instances pointed out the method which must be pursued for improving our knowledge on this subject; and we have given the English reader a more copious list of experiments on the strength of materials than he will meet with in our language. Many useful deductions might be made from these premises respecting the manner of disposing and combining the strength of materials in our structures. The best form of joints, mortises, tenons, scarfings; the rules for joggling, tabling, faying, fitting, &c., practised in the delicate art of mait-making, are all founded on this doctrine: but the discussion of these would be equivalent to writing a complete treatise of carpentry. We hope that this will be executed by some intelligent mechanician, for there is nothing in our language on this subject but what is almost contemptible; yet there is no mechanic art that is more susceptible of scientific treatment. Such a treatise, if well executed, could not fail of being well received by the public in this age of mechanical improvement.","sp":380,"ep":418},{"h":"STRENGTHENERS","t":"or CORROBORANTS, such medicines as are supposed to add to the firmness of the solids.

But her reply to me was, that she conceived this was a strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; yet, to prove the contrary, a few days after there was one William Mother of Saltersbridge in the parish of Liffmore, who brought his son William to my house, desiring my wife to cure him, who was a person ready to afford her charity to her neighbours, according to her small skill in chirurgery.\u201d\nchirurgery. On which my wife told me, there was one that had the king's evil very grievously in the eyes, cheek, and throat; whereupon I told her, that she should now see whether this was a bare fancy or imagination, as the thought it, or the dictates of God's Spirit on my heart. Then I laid my hands on the places affected, and prayed to God for Jesus' sake to heal him; and bid the parent two or three days afterwards to bring the child to me again, which accordingly he did; and I then saw the eye was almost quite whole; and the node, which was almost as big as a pullet's egg, was supplicated; and the throat strangely amended; and, to be brief (to God's glory I speak it) within a month discharged itself quite, and was perfectly healed, and so continues, God be praised.\n\nThen there came to him one Margaret Mackshane of Ballinlecky, in the parish of Lismore, who had been afflicted with the evil above seven years, in a much more violent degree; and soon after, his fame increasing, he cured the same disease in many other persons for three years. He did not meddle all this time with any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>; till about the end of these three years, theague growing epidemical, he found, as formerly, that there was bestowed on him the gift of curing that disease. He cured Colonel Phaire, of Cahirmony in the county of Corke, of an ague, and afterwards many other persons of different distempers, by stroking; so that his name was wonderfully cried up, as if some divine person had been sent from above. January 1665-6, he came over to England, at the request of the earl of Orrey; in order to cure the lady of the lord-viscount Conway, of Ragley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICKSHIRE\">Warwickshire</a>, who had for many years laboured under a most violent headache. He staid at Ragley three weeks or a month; and though he failed in his endeavours to relieve that lady, he cured vast numbers of people in those parts and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>.\n\nThough we are no friends to the marvellous, nor believe it possible that either the king's evil or ague can be cured by stroking or friction of any kind, whether gentle or severe, we have no hesitation to acknowledge that many cures might be performed by Mr Greatrakes. Every reflecting person who reads the foregoing account which he gives of himself will see that he was an enthusiast, and believed himself guided by a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>; and such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of mankind, that his pretensions were readily admitted, and men crowded with eagerness to be relieved of their diseases. But it is well known to physicians, that in many cases the imagination has accomplished cures as wonderful as the force of medicine. It is owing chiefly to the influence of imagination that we have so many accounts from people of veracity of the wonderful effects of quack medicines. We are perfectly assured that these medicines, by their natural operation, can never produce the effects ascribed to them; for there is no kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> between the medicine and the effect produced, and often no connection between the medicine and the disease.","sp":418,"ep":423},{"h":"STROMATEUS","t":"a genus of fishes belonging to the order of apodes.

On the east side it has three or four little craters ranged near each other, not at the summit, but on the declivity, nearly at two-thirds of its height. But as the surface of the volcano is very rugged and intersected with hollow ways, it may be naturally concluded, that at the time of some great eruption, the summit and a part of this side fell in, as must have happened also to Vesuvius; consequently, the common chimney is at this day on the declivity, although always in the centre of the whole base. It is inhabited notwithstanding its fires; but care is taken to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of the crater, which is yet much to be feared. \"I was assured (says M. de Luc) by an Englishman, who, like me, had the curiosity to visit these isles, that the fine weather having invited him and his company to land at Stromboli, they ascended a volcano, whose craters at that time threw out nothing; but that while they were attentively viewing them, unapprehensive of any danger, they were suddenly saluted by such a furious discharge, as to be obliged to retreat with precipitation, and not without one of the company being wounded by a piece of scoria.\" Of all the volcanoes recorded in history, Stromboli seems to be the only one that burns without ceasing.

His father Mr. George Stuart was professor of humanity in the university, and a man of considerable eminence for his classical taste and literature. For these accomplishments he was probably indebted in no small degree to his relation the celebrated Ruddiman, with whom both he and his son conversed familiarly, though they afterwards united to injure his fame.\n\nGilbert having finished his classical and philosophical studies in the grammar-school and university, applied himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>, without following, or probably intending to follow, the profession of the law. For that profession he has been represented as unqualified by indolence; by a passion which at a very early period of life he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> for general literature; or by boundless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a>:\u2014and all these circumstances may have contributed to make him relinquish pursuits in which he could hope to succeed only by patient perseverance and strict decorum of manners. That he did not waste his youth in idleness, is, however, evident from An Historical Dissertation concerning the Antiquity of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">Constitution</a>, which he published before he had completed his twenty-second year, and which had so much merit as to induce the university of Edinburgh to confer upon the author, though so young a man, the degree of LL.D.\n\nAfter a studious interval of some years, he produced a valuable work, under the title of A View of Society in Europe, in its Progress from Rudeness to Refinement; or, Inquiries concerning the History of Laws, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, and Manners. He had read and meditated with patience on the most important monuments of the middle ages; and in this volume (which speedily reached a second edition) he aimed chiefly at the praise of originality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, and discovered an industry that is seldom connected with ability and discernment. About the time of the publication of the first edition of this performance, having turned his thoughts to an academical life, he asked for the professorship of public law in the university of Edinburgh. According to his own account he had been promised that place by the minister, but had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to see the professorship bestowed on another, and all his hopes blasted by the influence of Dr. Robertson, whom he represented as under obligations to him.\n\nTo the writer of this article, who was a stranger to these rival candidates for historical fame, this part of the story seems very incredible; as it is not easy to conceive how it ever could be in the power of Dr. Stuart to render to the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">Principal</a> any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> service. It was believed indeed by the earl of Buchan, and by others, who observed that the illiberal jealousy not unfrequent in the world of letters, was probably the source of this opposition; which entirely broke the intimacy of two persons who, before that time, were understood to be on the most friendly footing with each other. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, however, is as likely to have been the vice of Dr. Stuart as of Dr. Robertson; for we have been told by a writer*, who, at least in one instance, has completely proved what he affirms, that \u201csuch was Gilbert Stuart\u2019s laxity of principle as a man, that he considered ingratitude as one of the most venial sins; such was his conceit as a writer, that he regarded no one\u2019s merits but his own; such were his disappointments, both as a writer and a man, that he allowed his prejudices to four into malice, and indulged his malevolence till it settled in corruption.\u201d\n\nSoon after this disappointment, Dr. Stuart went to London, where he became from 1768 to 1774 one of the writers of the Monthly Review. In 1772 Dr. Adam, rector of the high-school at Edinburgh, published a Latin Grammar, which he intended as an improvement of the famous Ruddiman\u2019s. Stuart attacked him in a pamphlet under the name of Bubby, and treated him with much severity. In doing this, he was probably actuated more by some personal dislike of Dr. Adam than by regard for the memory of his learned relation; for on other occasions he showed sufficiently that he had no regard to Ruddiman\u2019s honour as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a>, editor, or critic.\n\nIn 1774 he returned to his native city, and began the Edinburgh Magazine and Review, in which he discussed the liberty and constitution of England, and distinguished himself by an inquiry into the character of John Knox the reformer, whose principles he reproved in the severest terms. About this time he revised and published Sullivan\u2019s Lectures on the Constitution of England. Soon after he turned his thoughts to the history of Scotland, and published Observations concerning its Public Law and Constitutional History; in which he examined with a critical care the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> book to Dr. Robertson\u2019s History. His next work was The History of the Reformation; a book which deserves praise for the easy dignity of the narrative, and for strict impartiality. His last great work, The History of Scotland from the Establishment of the Reformation to the Death of Queen Mary, which appeared in 1782, has been very generally read and admired. His purpose was to vindicate the character of the injured queen, and expose the weakness of the arguments by which Dr. Robertson had endeavoured to prove her guilty: but though the style of this work is his own, it contains very little matter which was not furnished by Goodall and Tyler; and it is with the arms which these two writers put into his hands that Dr. Stuart attacked his great antagonist.\n\nIn 1782 he once more visited London, and engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Herald and English Review; but the jaundice and droop increasing on him, he returned by sea to his native country, where he died in the house of his father on the 19th of August 1786.\n\nIn his person Dr. Stuart was about the middle size and justly proportioned. His countenance was modest and expressive, sometimes glowing with sentiments of friendship, of which he was truly susceptible, and at others darting that satire and indignation at folly and vice which appear in some of his writings. He was a boon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>; and, with a constitution that might have stood the shock of ages, he fell a premature martyr to intemperance. His talents were certainly great, and his writings are useful; but he seems to have been influenced more by passion than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, and in his character there was not much to be imitated.","sp":424,"ep":424},{"h":"STUCCO","t":"in building, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of white marble pulverized, and mixed with plaster of lime; and the whole being fitted and wrought up with water, is to be used like common plaster: this is called by Pliny muroratum opus, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBARIUM_OPUS\">albarium opus</a>.\nA patent has been granted to Mr B. Higgins for inventing a new kind of stucco, or water-cement, more firm and durable than any heretofore. Its composition, as extracted from the specification signed by himself, is as follows: \"Drift-land, or quarry (A) land, which consists chiefly of hard quartzite flat-faced grains with sharp angles; which is the freest, or may be most easily freed by washing, from clay, fels, and calcareous, gypseous, or other grains less hard and durable than quartz; which contains the smallest quantity of pyrites or heavy metallic matter inseparable by washing; and which suffers the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of its bulk in washing in the following manner\u2014is to be preferred before any other. And where a coarse and a fine land of this kind, and corresponding in the size of their grains with the coarse and fine lands hereafter described, cannot be easily procured, let such land of the foregoing quality be chosen as may be sorted and cleansed in the following manner:\n\n\"Let the land be sifted in streaming clear water, through a sieve which shall give passage to all such grains as do not exceed one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter; and let the stream of water and the sifting be regulated so that all the land, which is much finer than the Lynn-land commonly used in the London glasshouses, together with clay and every other matter specifically lighter than land, may be washed away with the stream, whilst the purer and coarser land, which passes through the sieve, subsides in a convenient receptacle, and whilst the coarse rubbish and rubble remain on the sieve to be rejected.\n\n\"Let the land which thus subsides in the receptacle be washed in clean streaming water through a finer sieve, so as to be further cleansed and sorted into two parcels; a coarser, which will remain in the sieve which is to give passage to such grains of land only as are less than one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter, and which is to be saved apart under the name of coarse land; and a finer, which will pass through the sieve and subside in the water, and which is to be saved apart under the name of fine land.\u2014Let the coarse and the fine land be dried separately, either in the sun or on a clean iron plate, let on a convenient surface, in the manner of a land-heat (B).\n\n\"Let lime be chosen (C) which is stone-lime, which heats the most in flaking, and flakes the quickest when duly watered; which is the freest made and closest kept; which dissolves in distilled vinegar with the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>, and leaves the smallest residue insoluble, and in this residue the smallest quantity of clay, gypsum, or martial matter.\n\n\"Let the lime chosen according to these important rules be put in a brass-wired sieve to the quantity of 14 pounds. Let the sieve be finer than either of the foregoing; the finer, the better it will be; let the lime be flaked (D) by plunging it in a butt filled with soft water, and raising it out quickly and suffering it to heat and fume, and by repeating this plunging and raising alternately, and agitating the lime, until it be made to pass through the sieve into the water; and let the part of the lime which does not easily pass through the sieve be rejected; and let fresh portions of the lime be thus used, until as many (E) ounces of lime have passed through the sieve as there are quarts of water in the butt. Let the water thus impregnated stand in the butt closely covered (F) until it becomes clear; and through wooden (G) cocks placed at different heights in the butt, let the clear liquor be drawn off as fast (H) and as\n\n(A) \"This is commonly called pit-land.\n\n(B) \"The land ought to be stirred up continually until it is dried, and is then to be taken off; for otherwise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> will be very slow, and the land which lies next the iron plate, by being overheated, will be discoloured.\n\n(C) \"The preference given to stone-lime is founded on the present practice in the burning of lime, and on the closer texture of it, which prevents it from being so soon injured by exposure to the air as the more spongy chalk-lime is; not on the popular notion that stone-lime has something in it whereby it excels the best chalk in the cementing properties. The gypsum contained in lime-stone remains unaltered, or very little altered, in the lime, after the burning; but it is not to be expected that clay or martial matter should be found in their native state in well-burned lime; for they concrete or vitrify with a part of the calcareous earth, and constitute the hard grains or lumps which remain undissolved in weak acids, or are separable from the flaked lime by sifting it immediately through a sieve.\n\n(D) \"This method of impregnating the water with lime is not the only one which may be adopted. It is, however, preferred before others, because the water clears the sooner in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of its being warmed by the flaking lime; and the gypseous part of the lime does not diffuse itself in the water so freely in this way as it does when the lime is flaked to fine powder in the common method, and is then blended with the water; for the gypseous part of the lime flakes at first into grains rather than into fine powder, and will remain on the sieve after the pure lime has passed through, long enough to admit of the intended separation; but when the lime is otherwise flaked, the gypseous grains have time to flake to a finer powder, and passing through the sieve, dissolve in the water along with the lime. I have imagined that other advantages attended this method of preparing the lime-water, but I cannot yet speak of them with precision.\n\n(E) \"If the water contains no more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDULOUS\">acidulous</a> gas than is usually found in river or rain water, a fourth part of this quantity of lime, or less, will be sufficient.\n\n(F) \"The calcareous crust which forms on the surface of the water ought not to be broken, for it afflicts in excluding the air, and preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of acidulous gas whereby the lime-water is spoiled.\n\n(G) \"Brass-cocks are apt to colour a part of the liquor.\n\n(H) \"Lime-water cannot be kept many days unimpaired, in any vessels that are not perfectly air-tight. If the liquor be drawn off before it clears, it will contain whiting, which is injurious; and if it be not instantly used...\"\nStucco, as low as the lime subsides, for use. This clear liquor I call the cementing liquor (1). The freer the water is from saline matter, the better will be the cementing liquor made with it.\n\nLet 56 pounds of the aforesaid chosen lime be flaked, by gradually sprinkling on it, and especially on the unflaked pieces, the cementing liquor, in a clofe (i) clean place. Let the flaked part be immediately (i) fitted through the last-mentioned fine brafs-wired sieve: Let the lime which passes be used instantly, or kept in air-tight vessels, and let the part of the lime which does not pass through the sieve be rejected (ii).\n\nThis finer richer part of the lime which passes through the sieve I call purified lime.\n\nLet bone-ash be prepared in the usual manner, by grinding the whitest burnt bones, but let it be fitted, to be much finer than the bone-ash commonly sold for making cupels.\n\nThe most eligible materials for making my cement being thus prepared, take 56 pounds of the coarse land and 42 pounds of the fine land; mix them on a large plank of hard wood placed horizontally; then spread the sand so that it may stand to the height of six inches, with a flat surface on the plank; wet it with the cementing liquor; and let any superfluous quantity of the liquor, which the sand in the condition described cannot retain, flow away off the plank. To the wettest sand add 14 pounds of the purified lime in several successive portions, mixing and beating them up together in the mean time with the instruments generally used in making fine mortar: then add 14 pounds of the bone-ash in successive portions, mixing and beating all together. The quicker and the more perfectly these materials are mixed and beaten together, and the sooner the cement thus formed is used, the better (iv) it will be. This I call the water-cement coarse-grained, which is to be applied in building, pointing, plastering, stuccoing, or other work, as mortar and stucco now are; with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> chiefly, that as this cement is shorter than mortar or common stucco, and dries sooner, it ought to be worked expeditiously in all cases; and in stuccoing, it ought to be laid on by sliding the trowel upwards on it; that the materials used along with this cement in building, or the ground on which it is to be laid in stuccoing, ought to be well wetted with the cementing liquor in the instant of laying on the cement; and that the cementing liquor is to be used when it is necessary to moisten the cement, or when a liquid is required to facilitate the floating of the cement.\n\nWhen such cement is required to be of a finer texture, take 98 pounds of the fine land, wet it with the cementing liquor, and mix it with the purified lime and the bone-ash in the quantities and in the manner above described; with this difference only, that 15 pounds of lime, or (o) thereabouts, are to be used instead of 14 pounds, if the greater part of the land be as fine as Lynn-land. This I call water-cement fine-grained. It is to be used in giving the last coating, or the finish to any work intended to imitate the finer-grained stones or stucco. But it may be applied to all the uses of the water-cement coarse-grained, and in the same manner.\n\nWhen for any of the foregoing purposes of pointing, building, &c., such a cement is required much cheaper and coarser-grained, then much coarser clean land than the foregoing coarse land, or well-washed fine rubble, is to be provided. Of this coarse land or rubble take 56 pounds, of the foregoing coarse land 28 pounds, and of the fine land 14 pounds; and after mixing these, and wetting them with the cementing liquor in the foregoing manner, add 14 pounds, or somewhat less, of the (v) purified lime, and then 14 pounds or somewhat less.\n\nused after it is drawn limpid from the butt into open vessels, it will grow turbid again, and deposit the lime changed to whitening by the gas absorbed from the air. The calcareous matter which subsides in the butt resembles whitening the more nearly as the lime has been more sparingly employed; in the contrary circumstances, it approaches to the nature of lime; and in the intermediate state, it is fit for the common composition of the plasterers for inside stucco.\n\n(1) \"At the time of writing this specification, I preferred this term before that of lime-water, on grounds which I had not sufficiently examined.\n\n(i) \"The vapour which arises in the flaking of lime contributes greatly to the flaking of these pieces which lie in its way; and an unnecessary waste of the liquor is prevented, by applying it to the lime heaped in a pit or in a vessel, which may restrain the issue of the vapour, and direct it through the mass. If more of the liquor be used than is necessary to flake the lime, it will create error in weighing the flaked powder, and will prevent a part of it from passing freely through the sieve. The liquid is therefore to be used sparingly, and the lime which has escaped its action is to be sprinkled apart with fresh liquor.\n\n(ii) \"When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGGREGATION\">aggregation</a> of the lumps of lime is thus broken, it is impaired much sooner than it is in the former state, because the air more freely pervades it.\n\n(iii) \"Because it consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> matter or of ill-burnt lime; which last will flake and pass through the sieve, if the lime be not immediately fitted after the flaking, agreeable to the text.\n\n(iv) \"These proportions are intended for a cement made with sharp sand, for incrustation in exposed situations, where it is necessary to guard against the effects of hot weather and rain. In general, half this quantity of bone-ashes will be found sufficient; and although the incrustation in this latter case will not harden deeply so soon, it will be ultimately stronger, provided the weather be favourable.\n\n(v) \"The injuries which lime and mortar sustain by exposure to the air, before the cement is finally placed in a quiescent state, are great; and therefore our cement is the worse for being long beaten, but the better as it is quickly beaten until the mixture is effected, and no longer.\n\n(o) \"The quantity of bone-ashes is not to be increased with that of the lime; but it is to be lessened as the exposure and purposes of the work will admit.\n\n(p) \"Because less lime is necessary, as the sand is coarser.\"\nless of the bone-ash, mixing them together in the manner already described. When my cement is required to be white, white sand, white lime; and the whitest bone-ashes are to be chosen. Gray sand, and gray bone-ashes formed of half-burnt bones, are to be chosen to make the cement gray; and any other colour of the cement is obtained, either by choosing coloured sand, or by the admixture of the necessary quantity of coloured talc in powder, or of coloured, vitreous, or metallic powders, or other durable colouring ingredients commonly used in paint.\n\n\"To the end that such a water-cement as I have described may be made as useful as it is possible in all circumstances; and that no person may imagine that my claim and right under these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LETTERS_PATENT\">letters-patent</a> may be eluded by divers variations, which may be made in the foregoing process without producing any notable defect in the cement; and to the end that the principles of this art, as well as the art itself, of making my cement, may be gathered from this specification and perpetuated to the public; I shall add the following observations:\n\n\"This my water-cement, whether the coarse or fine grained, is applicable in forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> stone, by making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> layers of the cement and of flint, hard stone, or brick, in moulds of the figure of the intended stone, and by exposing the masses so formed to the open air to harden.\n\n\"When such cement is required for water fences, two-thirds of the prescribed quantity of bone-ashes are to be omitted; and in the place thereof an equal measure of powdered terras is to be used; and if the sand employed be not of the coarsest sort, more terras must be added, so that the terras shall be by weight one-sixth part of the weight of the sand.\n\n\"When such a cement is required of the finest grain (s) or in a fluid form, so that it may be applied with a brush, flint powder, or the powder of any quartofe or hard earthy substance, may be used in the place of terras; but in a quantity smaller, as the flint or other powder is finer; so that the flint-powder, or other such powder, shall not be more than five times the weight of the lime, nor less than four times its weight. The greater the quantity of lime within these limits, the more will the cement be liable to crack by quick drying, and vice versa.\n\n\"Where such sand as I prefer cannot be conveniently procured, or where the sand cannot be conveniently washed and sorted, that sand which most resembles the mixture of coarse and fine sand above prescribed, may be used as I have directed, provided due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to the quantity of the lime, which is to be greater (t) as the quantity is finer, and vice versa.\n\n\"Where sand cannot be easily procured, any durable stony body, or baked earth grossly powdered (u), and sorted nearly to the sizes above prescribed for sand, may be used in the place of sand, measure for measure, but not weight for weight, unless such gross powder be as heavy specifically as sand.\n\n\"Sand may be cleansed from every softer, lighter, and less durable matter, and from that part of the sand which is too fine, by various methods preferable (x), in certain circumstances, to that which I have described.\n\n\"Water may be found naturally free from fixable gas, feline, or clay; such water may, without any notable inconveniences, be used in the place of the cementing liquor; and water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> this state will not require so much lime as I have ordered to make the cementing liquor; and a cementing liquor sufficiently useful may be made by various methods of mixing lime and water in the described proportions, or nearly so.\n\n\"When stone-lime cannot be procured, chalk-lime, or shell-lime, which best resembles stone-lime, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> above written of lime, may be used in the manner\n\n(Q) \"But they must not be exposed to the rain until they are almost as strong as fresh Portland stone; and even then they ought to be sheltered from it as much as the circumstances will admit. These stones may be made very hard and beautiful, with a small expense of bone-ash, by soaking them, after they have dried thoroughly and hardened, in the lime liquor, and repeating this process twice or thrice, at distant intervals of time. The like effect was experienced in incrustations.\n\n(R) \"In my experiments, mortar made with terras-powder, in the usual method, does not appear to form so strong a cement for water-fences as that made, according to the specification, with coarse sand; and I see no more reason for avoiding the use of sand in terras-mortar, than there would be for rejecting stone from the embankment. The bone-ashes present in this place are the dark gray or black sort. I am not yet fully satisfied about the operation of them in this instance.\n\n(S) \"The qualities and uses of such fine calcareous cement are recommended chiefly for the purpose of smoothing and finishing the stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRUCIFORM\">cruciform</a> works, or for washing walls to a lively and uniform colour.

He afterwards pursued his study at Liege in the college of St Jerom; and then went to Louvain in 1524. Five years he spent there, three in learning and two in teaching. He set up a printing-press with Rugger Recius professor of the Greek tongue, and printed several Greek authors. He went to Paris in 1529, where he was highly esteemed, and read public lectures on the Greek and Latin writers, and on logic. He married there, and kept a great number of boarders; but as he liked what were called the new opinions, he was more than once in danger; and this undoubtedly was the reason why he removed to Straiburg in 1537, in order to take possession of the place offered him by the magistrates. The year following he opened a school, which became\n\n(y) \"This practice is noticed, as the remedy which may be used for the defects arising from evasive measures, and as the method of giving spongy incrustations containing bone-ashes the greatest degree of hardness.\"\nbecame famous, and by his means obtained of Maximilian II. the title of an university in 1566.

His talents were not confined to the school; for he was frequently intrusted with deputations in Germany and foreign countries, and discharged these employments with great honour and diligence. He showed extreme charity to the refugees on account of religion: He not only laboured to assist them by his advice and recommendations; but he even impoverished himself for them.

It is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind, and of the order in which they are there produced.\n\nThe qualities of a good style may be ranked under two heads; perspicuity and ornament. It will readily be admitted, that perspicuity ought to be essentially connected with every kind of writing; and to attain it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> must be paid, first to single words and phrases, and then to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of sentences. When considered with respect to words and phrases, it requires these three qualities; purity, propriety, and precision. When considered with regard to sentences, it requires a clear arrangement of the words and unity in the sentence; to which, if strength and harmony be added, the style will become ornamented.\n\nOne of the most important directions to be observed by him who wishes to form a good style, is to acquire clear and precise ideas on the subject concerning which he is to write or speak. To this must be added frequency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and an acquaintance with the style of the best authors. A fervent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, however, of any author is carefully to be avoided; for he who copies, can hardly avoid copying faults as well as beauties. A style cannot be proper unless it be adapted to the subject, and likewise to the capacity of our hearers, if we are to speak in public. A simple, clear, and unadorned style, such as that of Swift, is fitted for intricate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>; a style elegant as Addison's, or impetuous like Johnson's, is most proper for fixing the attention on truths, which, though known, are too much neglected.

What could have given rise to this fable of Charon and his boat, it is not very material to inquire. Mythological writers have said, that the Greeks learned it from the Egyptians, which is indeed probable enough; that the Egyptians framed both this, and some other fables relating to the dead, from certain customs peculiar to their country; that in particular there was, not far from Memphis, a famous burying-place, to which the dead bodies were conveyed in a boat across the lake Acherusia; and that Charon was a boatman who had long officiated in that service.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">Hereditary</a> Right.\u2014From the days of Egbert, the first folk monarch of England, even to the present, the four cardinal maxims mentioned in that article have ever been held constitutional canons of succession. It is true, as Sir William Blackstone observes, this succession, through fraud or force, or sometimes through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, when in hostile times the crown descended on a minor or the like, has been very frequently suspended; but has generally at last returned back into the old hereditary channel, though sometimes a very considerable period has intervened. And even in those instances where this succession has been violated, the crown has ever been looked upon as hereditary in the wearer of it. Of which the usurpers themselves were so sensible, that they for the most part endeavoured to vamp up some feeble show of a title by descent, in order to amuse the people, while they gained the possession of the kingdom. And, when possession was once gained, they considered it as the purchase or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of a new estate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>, and transmitted, or endeavoured to transmit it, to their own posterity by a kind of hereditary right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURPATION\">usurpation</a>. (See Black. Com. vol. i. 197\u2014217.) From the historical view there given, it appears that the title to the crown is at present hereditary, though not quite so absolutely hereditary as formerly: and the common flock or ancestor, from whom the descent must be derived, is also different. Formerly the common flock was King Egbert; then William the Conqueror; afterwards, in James I.'s time, the two common flocks united; and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the vacancy of the throne in 1688: now it is the Prince's Sophia in whom the inheritance was vested by the new king and parliament. Formerly, the descent was absolute, and the crown went to the heir without any restriction: but now, upon the new settlement, the inheritance is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a>: being limited to such heirs only, of the body of the Prince's Sophia, as are Protestant members of the church of England, and are married to none but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>.\n\nAnd in this due medium consists the true constitutional notion of the right of succession to the imperial crown of these kingdoms. The extremes between which it fleers are each of them equally destructive of those ends for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> were formed and kept on foot. Where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, upon every succession, is elected by the people, and may by the express provision of the laws be deposed (if not punished) by his subjects, this may found like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of liberty, and look well enough when delineated on paper; but in practice will be ever productive of tumult, contention, and anarchy. And, on the other hand, divine indefeasible hereditary right, when coupled with the doctrine of unlimited passive obedience, is surely of all constitutions the most thoroughly flavished and dreadful. But when such an hereditary right as our laws have created and vested in the royal stock, is closely interwoven with those liberties which are equally the inheritances of the subject; this union\nunion will form a constitution, in theory the most beautiful of any, in practice the most approved, and, we trust, in duration the most permanent.\n\nIn France the succession to the monarchy was limited to heirs male (see Salic); but in Navarre the crown was inherited by the heir of line, whether male or female. The case stands thus: Philip the Fourth, king of France, surnamed the Fair, in the year 1285 espoused Jane queen of Navarre in her own right; and as king consort of this latter kingdom added the title of Navarre to his former one of France. Louis X. son and heir of Philip and Jane (surnamed Hutin or the Boilereous), succeeded to both crowns. By Margaret his first wife, who had been crowned queen of Navarre, he left one daughter, Joan or Jane. His second wife Clementina was pregnant at the time of his decease, and was delivered of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> son, whom most of the French annalists recognize as John I. of France, though he lived no longer than three weeks. On his death the kingdom of France passed to Philip V. (surnamed the Long), and that of Navarre (to which the Salic law could by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> extend) to Joanna the only child and heir of Louis and Margaret. From Joanna, in lineal succession, the kingdom of Navarre passed to Jane d'Albret, mother of Henry IV. of France, and wife of Anthony of Vendome, who as king consort wore the crown of Navarre. On the accession of Henry to the kingdom of France, the two monarchies were united, and the four succeeding princes assumed the joint titles.\n\nSuccinic acid, an acid extracted from amber by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATION\">sublimation</a> in a gentle heat, and which rises in a concrete form into the neck of the subliming vessel.

He discovered an uncommon propensity to the acquiring of languages, in so much that he is reported to have spoken Latin at five years of age, and to have written it at nine. When he grew Suckling up, he travelled; but seems to have affected nothing more than the character of a courtier and fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>; which he so far attained, that he was allowed to have the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of making every thing he did become him. In his travels he made a campaign under the great Gustavus Adolphus; and his loyalty, if not his valour, appeared in the beginning of our civil wars; for, after his return to England, he raised a troop of horse for the king's service entirely at his own charge; and mounted them so completely and richly, that they are said to have cost him 12,000l. This troop, with Sir John at its head, behaved so ill in the engagement with the Scots, upon the English borders, in 1639, as to occasion the famous lampoon composed by Sir John Mennis; \"Sir John he got him an ambling nag,\" &c. This ballad, which was set to a brisk tune, was much sung by the parliamentarians, and continues to be sung to this day. This disastrous expedition, and the ridicule that attended it, was supposed to have hastened his death; being seized by a fever, of which he died, at 28 years of age. He was a frightfully wit, and an easy versifier, but no great poet.

During his disgrace he composed many works, which are lost. Those now extant are his History of the XII first Emperors, and a part of his treatise of the Illustrious Grammarians and Rhetoricians. Pliny the Younger was his intimate friend, and persuaded him to publish his books. His History of the XII Roman Emperors has been much commended by most of our polite scholars. He represents, in a continued series of curious and interesting particulars, without any digressions or reflections, the actions of the emperors, without omitting their vices, which he exposes with all their\nSuetonius their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>, and with the same freedom mentions the good qualities of the very same persons; but the horrid dissoluteness and obscene actions he relates of Tibertius, Caligula, Nero, &c., have made some say, that he wrote the lives of the emperors with the same licentiousness with which they lived. The edition of this history procured by Graevius at Utrecht in 1672, with the excellent Commentaries of Torrentius and Caffabon, and the notes of some other learned critics, is much esteemed.

The country around it is a sandy plain, without the smallest spot of verdure. The only water which can be drunk is brought from El-Naba, or the spring, at the distance of three hours' journey; and it is so brackish, that without a mixture of rum it is insupportable to Europeans. The town itself is a collection of miserable ruins, the khans being the only solid buildings; yet from March till June, the season when the Jidda and Yambo fleet arrives, the town becomes crowded; but after its departure nobody remains except the governor, who is a Mamlouk, 12 or 14 persons who form his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>, and the garrison. The fortres is a defenceless heap of ruins, which the Arabs consider as a citadel, because it contains six brass four-pounders, and two Greek gunners, who turn their heads aside when they fire. The harbour is a wretched quay, where the smallest boats are unable to reach the shore, except at the highest tides. There, however, the merchandise is embarked, to convey it over the banks of sand to the vessels which anchor in the road. This road, situated a league from the town, is separated from it by a flore which is left dry at low water; it has no works for its defence, so that the vessels which Mr. Volney tells us he has seen there, to the number of 28 at a time, might be attacked without opposition; for the ships themselves are incapable of resistance, none having any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> than four rusty swivels.\n\nSuez has always been, notwithstanding its local disadvantages, a place of great trade, on account of its geographical situation. It was by the gulf of Suez that the commodities of India were formerly conveyed to Europe, till the discovery of the passage by the Cape of Good Hope converted that trade into a new channel. As the isthmus of Suez, which separates the Red Sea from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, is not more than 57 miles, it has been frequently proposed to join these two seas together by a canal. As there are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> nor remarkable inequalities of surface, this plan would at first view appear easy to be executed. But though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of levels would not prevent a junction, the great difficulty arises from the nature of the corresponding coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red sea, which are of a low and sandy soil, where the waters form lakes, shoals, and marshes, so that vessels cannot approach within a considerable distance. It will therefore be found scarcely possible to dig a permanent canal amid these shifting sands: not to mention, that the shore is destitute of harbours, which must be entirely the work of art. The country besides has not a drop of fresh water, and to supply the inhabitants, it must be brought as far as from the Nile.\n\nThe best and only method therefore of effecting this junction, is that which has been already successfully practised at different times; which is, by making the river itself the medium of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, for which the ground is perfectly well calculated; for Mount Makatun suddenly terminating in the latitude of Cairo, forms only a low and semicircular mound, round which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> plain from the banks of the Nile as far as the point of the Red sea. The ancients, who early understood the advantage to be derived from this situation, adopted the idea of joining the two seas by a canal connected with the river. Strabo * observes, that this was first executed under Seleucus, who reigned about the time of the Trojan war; and this work was so formidable as to occasion it to be remarked, \"that it was 100 cubits (or 170 feet) wide, and deep enough for large vessels.\" After the Greeks conquered the country, it was restored by the Ptolemies, and again renewed by Trajan. In short, even the Arabs themselves followed these examples. \"In the time of Omar ibn-el-Kattab (says the historian El Makin), the cities of Mecca and Medina suffering from famine, the caliph ordered Amrou governor of Egypt to cut a canal from the Nile to Kolumzoum, that the contributions of corn and barley appointed for Arabia might be conveyed that way.\"\n\nThis canal is the same which runs at present to Cairo, and lies itself in the country to the north-east of Berket-el-Hadj, or the Lake of the Pilgrims.\n\nThe place on the west coast of the gulf of Suez, where the children of Israel are supposed to have entered it, is called Badea, about six miles to the north of Cape Korondel, on the other side of the gulf, as we are informed in a letter from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Edward Worley Montague, F.R.S. to Dr. Watson, containing an account of his journey from Cairo to the Written Mountains in the desert of Sinai. Opposite to Badea is a strong current which sets to the opposite shore, about south-east, with a whirlpool called Birque Pharaone, the well or pool of Pharaoh, being the place where his host is said to have been destroyed. We are told by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, that the Egyptian shore from Suez to Badea is so rocky and steep, that there was no entering upon the gulf but at one of these two places.\n\nThe British nation, we believe, never attempted to carry on commerce with any of the ports of the Red Sea beyond Jidda, till, on the suggestion of Mr. Bruce, in 1776, some British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> at Bengal equipped two or three vessels for Suez, laden with piece-goods of Bengal and coast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. The command of the vessels was committed to Captain Greig, a meritorious seaman; and the management of the goods was entrusted to Mr. Straw, a gentleman distinguished for his mercantile knowledge. The sale turned out to advantage; but such\nsuch great expenses were incurred in making presents to the bey of Cairo and Suez, as to consume the whole profits gained by the sale of the cargo. The great purpose of the expedition was, however, accomplished, as a firman was obtained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Cairo to trade by the way of Suez. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, three ships went to Suez the following year, and as many in 1778. The opening of this trade alarmed the jealousy of the East India Company; they applied to our government, and orders were given to relinquish this promising commerce. These orders reached Egypt sooner than Bengal, and the consequence was fatal to the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> who visited Suez that year (1779). By a plan concerted between the beys, a large body of Bedouin Arabs attacked the caravan passing from Suez to Cairo with goods valued at 12 lacks of rupees. The goods were plundered, the Europeans were stripped and left naked in the desert, exposed to the burning rays of the sun, without a drop of water to quench their thirst, or food to support life. Most of them died, and some of their bodies were afterwards found mangled and disfigured by wolves.

From west to east it is 52 miles in length, about 20 at a medium in breadth, and 166 in circumference. It contains 22 hundreds, 29 market-towns, 575 parishes, upwards of 34,000 houses, and 210,431 inhabitants. The whole is divided into two parts, viz. the Liberty of St Edmund, and the Geldable; the former of which contains the west parts of the county, and the other the east; and there is a grand jury for each at the assizes. The air is reckoned as wholesome and pleasant as any in the kingdom, nor is it otherwise upon the sea-coast, which is dry and sandy, and free from salt marshes. The soil, except to the west and upon the sea-coast, is very rich, being a compound of clay and marle. Towards the sea there are large heaths and tracts of land; but these produce hemp, rye, and pease, and feed great flocks of sheep. About Newmarket the soil is much the same; but in high Suffolk or the woodlands, besides wood, there are very rich pastures, where abundance of cattle are fed. In other parts of the county, as about Bury, there is plenty of corn. As this county is noted for the richness of its pastures, so is it for butter and cheese, especially the former, which is said to be remarkably good; so that being packed up in firkins, it is sold for all uses both by sea and land, and conveyed to many parts of England, especially to London.

The quantity consumed in Europe is estimated at nine millions sterling, and the demand would probably be greater if it could be sold at a reduced price. Since sugar then is reckoned so precious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>, it must be an object of desire to all persons of curiosity and research, to obtain some general knowledge of the history and nature of the plant by which it is produced, as well as to understand the processes by which the juice is extracted and refined. We will therefore first inquire in what countries it originally flourished, and when it was brought into general use, and became an article of commerce.\n\nFrom the few remains of the Grecian and Roman authors which have survived the ravages of time, we can find no proofs that the juice of the sugar-cane was known.\nat a very early period. There can be no doubt, however, that in those countries where it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGENOUS\">indigenous</a> its value was not long concealed. It is not improbable that it was known to the ancient Jews; for there is some reason to suppose, that the Hebrew word \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, which occurs frequently in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, and is by our translators rendered sometimes calamus and sometimes sugar-cane, does in fact mean the sugar-cane. The first passage in which we have observed it mentioned is Exodus xxx. 23., where Moses is commanded to make an ointment with myrrh, cinnamon, kene, and cassia. Now the kene does not appear to have been a native of Egypt nor of Judea; for in Jeremiah vi. 20. it is mentioned as coming from a far country. \"To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba and the sweet-cane from a far country?\" This is not true of the calamus aromaticus, which grows spontaneously in the Levant, as well as in many parts of Europe. If the cinnamon mentioned in the passage of Exodus quoted above was true cinnamon, it must have come from the East Indies, the only country in the world from which cinnamon is obtained. There is no difficulty therefore in supposing, that the sugar-cane was exported from the same country. If any credit be due to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, it confirms the opinion that kene denotes the sugar-cane; for the Latin word canna and the English word cane are evidently derived from it. It is also a curious fact, that sugar or flecker, in Hebrew, signifies inebriation, from which the Greek word \u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \"sugar,\" is undoubtedly to be traced.\n\nThe sugar-cane was first made known to the western parts of the world by the conquests of Alexander the Great. Strabo relates that Nearchus his admiral found it in the East Indies in the year before Christ 325. It is evidently alluded to in a fragment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>, preserved in Photius. Varro, who lived A.C. 68., describes it in a fragment quoted by Isidorus as a fluid pressed from reeds of a large size, which was sweeter than honey. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIOSCORIDES\">Dioscorides</a>, about the year 35 before Christ, says \"that there is a kind of honey called faccharon, which is found in India and Arabia Felix. It has the appearance of salt, and is brittle when chewed. If dissolved in water, it is beneficial to the bowels and stomach, is useful in diseases of the bladder and kidneys, and, when sprinkled on the eye, removes those substances that obscure the sight.\" This is the first account we have of its medical qualities. Galen often prescribed it as a medicine. Lucan relates, that an oriental nation in alliance with Pompey used the juice of the cane as a common drink.\n\nQuoque bilibunt tenera dulces ab arundine succos.\nLib. iii. 237.\n\nPliny says it was produced in Arabia and India, but that the best came from the latter country. It is also mentioned by Arrian, in his Periplus of the Red sea, by the name of \u03a3\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (sachar) as an article of commerce from India to the Red sea. Aelian, Tertullian, and Alexander Aphrodiseus mention it as a species of honey procured from canes (A.).\n\nThat the sugar-cane is an indigenous plant in some parts of the East Indies, we have the strongest reason to believe; for Thunberg found it in Japan, and accordingly mentioned it as a native of that country in his Flora Japonica, published in 1784. Olfeck also found it in China in 1751. It may indeed have been transplanted from some other country; but as it does not appear from history that the inhabitants of Japan or China ever carried on any commerce with remote nations, it could only be conveyed from some neighbouring country. Marco Polo, a noble Venetian, who travelled into the East about the year 1250, found sugar in abundance in Bengal. Vasco de Gama, who doubled the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, relates, that a considerable trade in sugar was then carried on in the kingdom of Calicut. On the authority of Dioscorides and Pliny, too, we should be disposed to admit, that it is a native of Arabia, did we not find, on consulting Niebuhr's Travels, that botanist has omitted it when enumerating the most valuable plants of that country. If it be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> production of Arabia, it must still flourish in its native soil. Mr Bruce found it in Upper Egypt. If we may believe the relation of Giovan Lioni, a considerable trade was carried on in sugar in Nubia in 1500; it abounded also at Thebes, on the Nile, and in the northern parts of Africa, about the same period.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the sugar-cane was introduced into Europe during the crusades; expeditions into Europe which however romantic in their plan, and unsuccessful probably in their execution, were certainly productive of many advantages to the nations of Europe. Albertus Aquensis, a monkish writer, observes, that the Christian soldiers in the Holy Land frequently derived refreshment and support during a scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> by sucking the canes. This plant flourished also in the Morea, and in the islands of Rhodes and Malta; from which it was transported into Sicily. The date of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> it is not easy to ascertain; but we are sure that sugar was cultivated in that island previous to the year 1166; for Lafran\u00e7ais, the Jesuit, who wrote a history of the Portuguese discoveries, mentions a donation made that year to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of St Bennet, by William the second, king of Sicily, of a mill for grinding sugar-canies, with all its rights, members, and appurtenances.\n\nFrom Sicily, where the sugar-cane still flourishes on the sides of Mount Hybla, it was conveyed to Spain, Madeira, the Canary and Cape de Verd islands, soon after they were discovered in the 15th century.\n\nAn opinion has prevailed, that the sugar-cane is not a native of the western continent, or its adjacent islands by some the West Indies, but was conveyed thither by the Spaniards or Portugueze soon after the discovery of America or by Columbus. From the testimony of Peter Martyr, in the West Indies, the third book of his first decade, composed during Co-Indies, Columbus's second voyage, which commenced in 1493 and ended in 1495, it appears, that the sugar-cane was known at that time in Hispaniola. It may be said, that it was brought thither by Columbus; but for this assertion we have found no direct evidence; and though we had\n\n(A) For a more minute account of the history of sugar in the early and middle ages, a paper of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> Transactions, in Volume IV. by Dr Falconer, may be consulted.\nSugar had direct evidence, this would not prove that the sugar-cane was not an indigenous plant of the West Indies. There are authors of learning who, after investigating this subject with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, do not hesitate to maintain, that it is a native both of the islands and of the continent of America.\n\nP. Labat has supported this opinion with much appearance of truth; and, in particular, he appeals to the testimony of Thomas Gage, an Englishman, who visited New Spain in 1625. Gage enumerates sugar-canes among the provisions with which the Caribes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUADALOUPE\">Guadaloupe</a> supplied his ship. \"Now (says Labat) it is a fact that the Spaniards had never cultivated an inch of ground in the smaller Antilles. Their ships commonly touched at those islands indeed for wood and water; and they left twine in the view of supplying with fresh provisions such of their countrymen as might call there in future; but it would be absurd in the highest degree to suppose, that they would plant sugar-canes, and at the same time put hogs ashore to destroy them.\n\nNeither had the Spaniards any motive for bestowing this plant on islands which they considered as of no kind of importance, except for the purpose that has been mentioned; and to suppose that the Charaibes might have cultivated, after their departure, a production of which they knew nothing, betrays a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the Indian disposition and character.\n\n\"But (continues Labat) we have surer testimony, and such as proves, beyond all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, that the sugar-cane is the natural production of America. For, besides the evidence of Francis Ximenes, who, in a Treatise on American Plants, printed at Mexico, affirms, that the sugar-cane grows without cultivation, and to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> size, on the banks of the river Plate, we are assured by Jean de Lery, a Protestant minister, who was chaplain in 1556 to the Dutch garrison in the fort of Coligny, on the river Janeiro, that he himself found sugar-canes in great abundance in many places on the banks of that river, and in situations never visited by the Portuguese. Father Hennepen and other voyagers bear testimony in like manner to the growth of the cane near the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a>; and Jean de Laet in its spontaneous production in the island of St Vincent. It is not for the plant itself, therefore, but for the secret of making sugar from it, that the West Indies are indebted to the Spaniards and Portuguese; and these to the nations of the east.\"\n\nSuch is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> of Labat, which the learned Lafitau has pronounced incontrovertible; and it is greatly strengthened by recent discoveries, the sugar-cane having been found in many of the islands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol13.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> by our late illustrious navigator Captain Cook.\n\nThe sugar-cane, or saccharum officinarum of botanists, is a jointed reed, commonly measuring (the flag part not included) from three feet and a half to seven feet in height, but sometimes rising to 12 feet. When ripe it is of a fine straw colour inclining to yellow, producing leaves or blades, the edges of which are finely and sharply serrated, and terminating in an arrow decorated with a panicle. The joints in one stalk are from 40 to 60 in number, and the stalks rising from one root are sometimes very numerous. The young shoot ascends from the earth like the point of an arrow; the shaft of which soon breaks, and the two first leaves, which had been inclosed within a quadruple sheath of seminal leaves, rise to a considerable height (b).\n\nAs the cane is a rank succulent plant, it must require soil most strong deep soil to bring it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, perhaps in favourable deed no soil can be too rich for this purpose. The soil to its which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has found to be most favourable to the growth cultivation of it in the West Indies is the dark gray loam of St Christopher's, which is so light and porous as to be penetrable by the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the hoe. The under stratum is gravel from 8 to 12 inches deep. Canes planted in particular spots in this island have been known to yield 8000 pounds of Mulcovado sugar from a single acre. The average produce of the island for a series of years has been 16,000 hogheads of 16 cwt., which is one-half only of the whole cane-land, or 8,500 acres. When annually cut, it gives nearly two hogsheads of 16 cwt. per acre for the whole of the land in ripe canes.\n\nNext to the ash loam of St Christopher's is the soil which in Jamaica is called brick-mould; not as resembling a brick in colour, but as containing such a due mixture of clay and sand as is supposed to render it well adapted for the use of the kiln. It is a deep, warm, and mellow, hazel earth, easily worked; and though its surface soon grows dry after rain, the under stratum retains a considerable degree of moisture in the driest weather; with this advantage too, that even in the wettest season it seldom requires trenching. Plant-canies, by which is meant canes of the first growth, have been known in very fine seasons to yield two tons and a half of sugar per acre. After this may be reckoned the black mould of several varieties. The best is the deep black earth of Barbadoes, Antigua, and some other of the windward islands; but there is a species of this mould in Jamaica that is but little, if any thing inferior to it, which abounds with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> and flint on a sub-stratum of foamy marle. Black mould on clay is more common; but\n\n(b) \"A field of canes, when standing, in the month of November, when it is in arrow or full blossom (says Mr Beckford in his descriptive Account of the Island of Jamaica), is one of the most beautiful productions that the pen or pencil can possibly describe. It in common rises from three to eight feet or more in height; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of growth that very strongly marks the difference of soil or the varieties of culture. It is when ripe of a bright and golden yellow; and where obvious to the sun, is in many parts very beautifully streaked with red: the top is of a darkish green; but the more dry it becomes, from either an excess of ripeness or a continuance of drought, of a ruffet yellow, with long and narrow leaves depending; from the centre of which shoots up an arrow like a silver wand from two to six feet in height; and from the summit of which grows out a plume of white feathers, which are delicately fringed with a lilac dye; and indeed is, in its appearance, not much unlike the tuft that adorns this particular and elegant tree.\"\nbut as the mould is generally shallow, and the clay stiff and retentive of water, this last sort of land requires great labour, both in ploughing and trenching, to render it profitable. When manured and properly pulverized, it becomes very productive. It is unnecessary to attempt a minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of all the other soils which are found in these islands. There is, however, a peculiar sort of land on the north side of Jamaica, chiefly in the parish of Trelawney, that cannot be passed over unnoticed, not only on account of its scarcity but its value; few soils producing finer sugars, or such as answer so well in the pan; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> signifying a greater return of refined sugar than common. The land alluded to is generally of a red colour; the shades of which, however, vary considerably from a deep chocolate to a rich scarlet; in some places it approaches to a bright yellow, but it is everywhere remarkable, when first turned up, for a glossy or shining surface, and if wetted stains the fingers like paint.\n\nAs in every climate there is a season more favourable for vegetation than others, it is of great importance that plants for seed be committed to the ground at the commencement of this season. As the cane requires a great deal of moisture to bring it to maturity, the properest season for planting it is in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> and October, when the autumnal rains commence, that it may be sufficiently luxuriant to shade the ground before the dry weather sets in. Thus the root is kept moist, and the crop is ripe for the mill in the beginning of the ensuing year. Canes planted in the month of November, or later in the season, lose the advantage of the autumnal rains; and it often happens that dry weather in the beginning of the ensuing year retards their vegetation until the vernal or May rains set in, when they sprout both at the roots and the joints; so that by the time they are cut the field is loaded with unripe suckers instead of sugar-canes. A January plant, however, commonly turns out well; but canes planted very late in the spring, though they have the benefit of the May rains, seldom answer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>; for they generally come in unseasonably, and throw the ensuing crops out of regular rotation. They are therefore frequently cut before they are ripe; or if the autumnal season sets in early, are cut in wet weather, which has probably occasioned them to spring afresh; in either case the effect is the same: The juice is uncooled, and all the sap being in motion, the root is deprived of its natural nourishment, to the great injury of the ratoon. The chief objection to a fall plant is this, that the canes become rank and top-heavy, at a period when violent rains and high winds are expected, and are therefore frequently lodged before they are fit to be cut.\n\nThe sugar-cane is propagated by the top-shoots, which are cut from the tops of the old canes. The usual method of planting in the West Indies is this: The quantity of land intended to be planted, being cleared of weeds and other incumbrances, is first divided into several plots of certain dimensions, commonly from 15 to 20 acres each; the spaces between each plot or division are left wide enough for roads, for the convenience of carting, and are called intervals. Each plot is then subdivided, by means of a line and wooden pegs, into small squares of about three feet and a half. Sometimes indeed the squares are a foot larger; but this circumstance makes but little difference. The negroes are then placed in a row in the first line, one to a square, and directed to dig out with their hoes the several squares, commonly to the depth of five or six inches. The mould which is dug up being formed into a bank at the lower side, the excavation or cane-hole field exceeds 15 inches in width at the bottom, and two feet and a half at the top. The negroes then fall back to the next line, and proceed as before. Thus the several squares between each line are formed into a trench of much the same dimensions with that which is made by the plough. An able negro will dig from 100 to 120 of these holes for his day's work of ten hours; but if the land has been previously ploughed and lain fallow, the same negro will dig nearly double the number in the same time (c).\n\nThe cane-holes or trench being now completed, whether by the plough or by the hoe, and the cuttings selected for planting, which are commonly the tops of the canes that have been ground for sugar (each cutting containing five or six gems), two of them are sufficient for a cane hole of the dimensions described. These, being placed longitudinally in the bottom of the hole, are covered with mould about two inches deep; the rest of the bank being intended for future use. In 12 or 14 days the young sprouts begin to appear; and as soon as they rise a few inches above the ground, they are, or ing it, ought to be, carefully cleared of weeds, and furnished with an addition of mould from the banks. This is usually performed by the hand. At the end of four or five months the banks are wholly levelled, and the spaces between the rows carefully hoe-ploughed. Frequent cleanings, while the canes are young, are indeed of essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, that no other merit in an overseer can compensate for the want of attention in this particular. A careful manager will remove at the same time all the lateral shoots or suckers that spring up after the canes begin to joint, as they seldom come to maturity, and draw nourishment from the original plants.\n\n\"In the cultivation of other lands, in Jamaica especially (says Mr Edwards, the elegant historian of the West Indies, whose superior excellence has induced us frequently to refer to him in the course of this article), the plough has been introduced of late years, and in some few cases to great advantage; but it is not every soil or situation that will admit the use of the plough; some lands being much too stony, and others too steep; and I am sorry I have occasion to remark, that a practice\n\n(c) As the negroes work at this business very unequally, according to their different degrees of bodily strength, it is sometimes the practice to put two negroes to a single square; but if the land has not had the previous assistance of the plough, it commonly requires the labour of 50 able negroes for 13 days to hole 20 acres. In Jamaica, some gentlemen, to save their own slaves, have this laborious part of the planting-business performed by job-work. The usual price for holing and planting is 6l. currency per acre (equal to 4l. 7s. sterling). The cost of falling and clearing heavy wood-land is commonly as much more.\ntice commonly prevails in Jamaica, on properties where this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> is used, which would exhaust the finest lands in the world. It is that of ploughing, then cross-ploughing, round-ridging, and harrowing the same lands from year to year, or at least every other year, without affording manure: accordingly it is found that this method is utterly destructive of the ratoon or second growth, and altogether ruinous. It is indeed astonishing that any planter of common reading or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> should be passive under so pernicious a system. Some gentlemen, however, of late manage better: their practice is to break up stiff and clayey land, by one or two ploughings, early in the spring, and give it a summer's fallow. In the autumn following, being then mellow and more easily worked, it is holed and planted by manual labour after the old method, which has been already described.\n\nBut in truth, the only advantageous system of ploughing in the West Indies is to confine it to the simple operation of holing, which may certainly be performed with much greater facility and dispatch by the plough than by the hoe; and the relief which, in the case of stiff and dry soils, is thus given to the negroes, exceeds all estimation, in the mind of a humane and provident owner. On this subject I speak from practical knowledge. At a plantation of my own, the greatest part of the land which is annually planted is neatly and sufficiently laid into cane-holes, by the labour of one able man, three boys, and eight oxen, with the common single-wheeled plough. The ploughshare indeed is somewhat wider than usual; but this is the only difference, and the method of ploughing is the simplest possible. By returning the plough back along the furrow, the turf is alternately thrown to the right and to the left, forming a trench seven inches deep, about two feet and a half wide at the top, and one foot wide at the bottom. A space of 18 or 20 inches is left between each trench, on which the mould being thrown by the share, the banks are properly formed, and the holing is complete. Thus the land is not exhausted by being too much exposed to the sun; and in this manner a field of 20 acres is holed with one plough, and with great ease, in 13 days. The plants are afterwards placed in the trench as in the common method, where manual labour alone is employed.\n\nIn most parts of the West Indies it is usual to hole and plant a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the cane-land, commonly one-third, in annual rotation. Canes of the first year's growth are called plant canes, as has been already observed. The sprouts that spring from the roots of the canes that have been previously cut for sugar are called ratoons; the first yearly returns from their roots are called first ratoons; the second year's growth second ratoons.\n\nMr Edwards informs us, that the manure generally used is a compost formed, 1st, Of the vegetable ashes drawn from the fires of the boiling and still houses, 2dly, Feculencies discharged from the still house, mixed up with rubbish of buildings, white-lime, &c., 3dly, Refuse, or field-trash (i.e.), the decayed leaves and stems of the canes; to called in contradistinction to cane-trash, reserved for fuel. 4thly, Dung, obtained from the horse and mule stables, and from moveable pens, or small inclosures made by posts and rails, occasionally shifted upon the lands intended to be planted, and into which the cattle are turned at night. 5thly, Good mould, collected from gullies and other waste places, and thrown into the cattle-pens.\n\nThe sugar-cane is liable to be destroyed by monkeys, rats, and insects. The upland plantations suffer greatly cane destroyed from monkeys; these creatures, which now abound in the mountainous parts of St Christopher's, were first brought thither by the French, when they possessed half that island; they come down from the rocks in silent parties by night, and having posted sentinels to give the alarm if anything approaches, they destroy incredible quantities of the cane, by their gambols as well as their greediness. It is in vain to set traps for these creatures, however baited; and the only way to protect the plantation, and destroy them, is to set a numerous watch, well armed with fowling-pieces, and furnished with dogs. The negroes will perform this service cheerfully, for they are very fond of monkeys as food. The celebrated Father Labat says, they are very delicious, but the white inhabitants of St Kitt's never eat them.\n\nThe low-land plantations suffer as much by rats as those on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> do from monkeys; but the rats, no more than the monkeys, are natives of the place; they came with the shipping from Europe, and breed in the ground under loose rocks and bulks: the field negroes eat them greedily, and they are said to be publicly sold in the markets at Jamaica. To free the plantations from these vermin, the breed of wild cats should be encouraged, and snakes suffered to multiply unmolested; they may also be poisoned with arsenic, and the rasped root of the caltava made into pellets, and plentifully scattered over the grounds. This practice, however, is dangerous; for as the rats when thus poisoned become exceeding thirsty, they run in droves to the neighbouring streams, which they poison as they drink, and the cattle grazing on the banks of these polluted waters have frequently perished by drinking after them. It is safer therefore to make the pellets of flour, kneaded with the juice of the nightshade, the scent of which will drive them away though they will not eat it. There is an East Indian animal called mungoos, which bears a natural antipathy to rats; if this animal was introduced into our sugar islands, it would probably extirpate the whole race of these noxious vermin. The formica omnivora of Linn\u00e6us, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> ant, which is called in Jamaica the raffle's ant, would soon clear a sugar plantation of rats.\n\nThe sugar-cane is also subject to a disease which no and inoffensive can obviate, and for which human wisdom has hitherto in vain attempted to find a remedy. This disease is called the blight, and is occasioned by a species of aphis. When this happens, the fine, broad, green blades become sickly, dry, and withered; soon after they appear flattened in spots; and if these spots are carefully examined, they will be found to contain innumerable eggs of an insect like a bug, which are soon quickened, and cover the plants with the vermin: the juice of the canes thus affected becomes sour, and no future shoot issues from the joints. Ants also concur with the bugs to spoil the plantation, and against these evils it is hard to find a remedy.\n\nThe crops of sugar-can\u00e9s do not ripen precisely at the same period in all the colonies. In the Danish, Spanish, and Dutch settlements, they begin in January, and continue till October. This method does not imply any fixed season for the maturity of the sugar-cane. The crop ripens\nplant, however, like others, must have its progress; and it hath been justly observed to be in flower in the months of November and December. It must necessarily follow, from the custom these nations have adopted of continuing to gather their crops for 10 months without intermission, that they cut some canes which are not ripe enough, and others that are too ripe, and then the fruit hath not the requisite qualities. The time of gathering them should be at a fixed season, and probably the months of March and April are the fittest for it; because all the sweet fruits are ripe at that time, while the four ones do not arrive at a state of maturity till the months of July and August.\n\nThe English cut their canes in March and April; but they are not induced to do this on account of their ripeness. The drought that prevails in their islands renders the rains which fall in September necessary to their planting; and as the canes are 18 months in growing, this period always brings them to the precise point of maturity (D).\n\n\"The time of crop in the sugar islands (says Mr Edwards) is the season of gladness and festivity to man and beast. So palatable, salutary, and nourishing, is the juice of the cane, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> of the animal creation, drinking freely of it, derives health and vigour from its use. The meagre and sickly among the negroes exhibit a surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in a few weeks after the mill is set in action. The labouring horses, oxen, and mules, though almost constantly at work during this season, yet, being indulged with plenty of the green tops of this noble plant, and some of the scumblings from the boiling-house, improve more than at any other period of the year. Even the pigs and poultry fatten on the refuse. In short, on a well-regulated plantation, under a humane and benevolent director, there is such an appearance during crop-time of plenty and busy cheerfulness, as to soften, in a great measure, the hardships of slavery, and induce a spectator to hope, when the miseries of life are represented as insupportable, that they are sometimes exaggerated through the medium of fancy.\"\n\nThe plants being cut, the branches at the top are given to the cattle for food; the top-shoot, which is full of eyes, is preserved for planting. The canes are cut into pieces about a yard long, tied up in bundles, and carried in carts to the mill, where they are bruised, and the juice is extracted from them. The mill consists principally of three upright iron-plated rollers or cylinders, from 30 to 40 inches in length, and from 20 to 25 inches in diameter; and the middle one, to which the moving power is applied, turns the other two by means of cogs. Between these rollers, the canes (being previously cut short, and tied into bundles) are twice compressed; for having passed through the first and second rollers, they are turned round the middle one by a circular piece of frame-work or screen, called in Jamaica the Dumb-returner, and forced back through the second and third; an operation which squeezes them completely dry, and sometimes even reduces them to powder. The cane juice is received in a leaden bed, and thence conveyed into a vessel called the receiver. The refuse, or macerated rind of the cane (which is called cane-wood, in contradistinction to field-wood), serves for fuel to boil the liquor.\n\nThe juice as it flows from the mill, taken at a medium, contains eight parts of pure water, one part of extracted sugar, and one part consisting of coarse oil and mucilaginous gum, with a portion of essential oil.\n\nAs this juice has a strong disposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, vessels used must be boiled as soon as possible. There are some water-mills that will grind with great ease canes sufficient for 30 hogheads of sugar in a week. It is necessary to have boiling vessels, or clarifiers, that will correspond in dimensions to the quantity of juice flowing from the receiver. These clarifiers are commonly three in number, and are sometimes capable of containing 1000 gallons each; but it is more usual to see them of 300 or 400 gallons each. Besides the clarifiers which are used for the first boiling, there are generally four copper or boilers. The clarifiers are placed in the middle or at one end of the boiling-house. If at one end, the boiler called the teache is placed at the other, and several boilers (generally three) are ranged between them. The teache is ordinarily from 70 to 100 gallons, and the boilers between the clarifiers and teache diminish in size from the first to the last. Where the clarifiers are in the middle, there is usually a set of three boilers of each side, which constitute in effect a double boiling-house. On very large estates this arrangement is found useful and necessary. The objection to so great a number is the expense of fuel; to obviate which, in some degree, the three boilers on each side of the clarifiers are commonly hung to one fire.\n\nThe juice runs from the receiver along a wooden gutter, lined with lead into the boiling-house, where it is received into one of the clarifiers. When the clarifier is filled, a fire is lighted, and a quantity of Bristol quicklime in powder, which is called temper, is poured into the vessel. The use of the lime is to unite with the superabundant acid, which, for the success of the process, it is necessary to get rid of. The quantity sufficient to separate the acid must vary according to the strength of the quicklime and the quality of the liquor. Some planters allow a pint of lime to every 100 gallons of liquor; but Mr Edwards thinks that little more than half the quantity is a better medium proportion, and even then, that it ought to be dissolved in boiling water, that as little of it as possible may be precipitated. The heat is suffered gradually to increase till it approaches within a few degrees of the heat of boiling water, that the impurities\n\n(D) The account given in the text concerning the time when the sugar-canies are collected, we have taken from the Able Raynal's History of the Trade and Settlements of the East and West Indies; but Mr Cazaud observes, that in February, March, and April, all the canes, whatever be their age, are as ripe as the nature of the soil ever allows them to be. He says farther, that the dryness of the weather, and not the age of the canes, which increases from January to April, is the cause that in January 400 gallons of juice commonly yield 48 gallons of sugar and molasses, one with another; in February from 56 to 64; in March from 64 to 72; in April sometimes 80; after which period the sugar ferments, and even burns, when the refiner is not very expert at his business.\npurities may be thoroughly separated. But if the liquor were suffered to boil with violence, the impurities would again incorporate with it. It is known to be sufficiently heated when the foam begins to rise in blisters, which break into white froth, and appear generally in about 45 minutes. The fire is then suddenly extinguished by means of a damper, which excludes the external air, and the liquor is allowed to remain about an hour undisturbed, during which period the impurities are collected in scum on the surface. The juice is then drained off either by a syphon or a cock; the scum being of a tenacious gummy nature, does not flow out with the liquor, but remains behind in the clarifier. The liquid juice is conveyed from the clarifier by a gutter into the evaporating boiler, commonly termed the grand copper; and if it has been obtained from good canes it generally appears transparent.\n\nIn the evaporating boiler, which should be large enough to receive the contents of the clarifier, the liquor is allowed to boil; and as the foam rises it is taken off. The scumming and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the liquor becomes finer and thicker, and so far diminished in bulk that it may be easily contained in the second copper. When put into the second copper, it is nearly of the colour of Madeira wine; the boiling and scumming are continued, and if the impurities be considerable, a quantity of lime-water is added. This process is carried on till the liquor be sufficiently diminished in quantity to be contained in the third copper. After being purified a third time, it is put into the fourth copper, which is called the teache, where it is boiled and evaporated till it is judged sufficiently pure to be removed from the fire. In judging of the purity of the liquor, many of the negroes (says Mr Edwards) guess solely by the eye (which by long habit they do with great accuracy), judging by the appearance of the grain on the back of the ladle; but the practice most in use is to judge by what is called the touch; i.e. taking up with the thumb a small portion of the hot liquor from the ladle; and, as the heat diminishes, drawing with the fore-finger the liquid into a thread. This thread will suddenly break, and shrink from the thumb to the suspended finger, in different lengths, according as the liquor is more or less boiled. The proper boiling height for strong mulecado sugar is generally determined by a thread of a quarter of an inch long. It is evident, that certainty in this experiment can be attained only by long habit, and that no verbal precepts will furnish any degree of skill in a matter depending wholly on constant practice.\n\nThe juice being thus purified by passing through the clarifier and four coppers, it is poured into coolers, which are usually six in number. The removal from the teache to the cooler is called striking. The cooler is a shallow wooden vessel seven feet long, from five to six wide, about 11 inches deep, and capable of containing a hoghead of sugar. As the liquor cools, the sugar grains, that is, collects into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> crystals, separating itself from the molasses. It is then removed from the cooler, and conveyed to the curing-house, where the molasses drain from it. For receiving them there is a large cistern, the sloping sides of which are lined with boards. Directly above the cistern a frame of joint-work without boarding is placed, on which empty hogheads without heads are ranged. The bottoms of these hogheads are pierced with 8 or 10 holes, in each of which the stalk of a plantain leaf is fixed so as to project six or eight inches below the joints, and rise a little above the top of the hoghead. The hogheads being filled with the contents of the cooler, consisting of sugar and molasses, the molasses being liquid, drain through the spongy stalk, and drop into the cistern. After the molasses are drained off, the sugar becomes pretty dry and fair, and is then called myconado or raw sugar.\n\nWe have described the process for extracting sugar, which is generally adopted in the British West India islands, according to the latest improvements; and have been anxious to present it to our readers in the simplest and most perspicuous form, that it might be intelligible to every person; and have therefore avoided to mention the observations and proposed amendments of those who have written on this subject. Had we done so, we should have swelled the present article to too great a size, without accomplishing the purpose which we have in view; for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> is not to instruct the planters, but to give a distinct account of the most approved methods which the planters have generally adopted. But though we judge it useless to trouble our readers with all the little varieties in the process which different persons employ, we flatter ourselves it will not be disagreeable to learn by what methods the French make their sugar purer and whiter than ours. A quantity of sugar from the cooler is put into conical pans or earthen purifying pots, called by the French former, having a small perforation at the apex, which is kept closed. Each cone, reversed on its apex, is supported in another earthen vessel. The syrup is filtered together, and then left to crystallize. At the end of 15 or 16 hours, the hole in the point of each cone is opened, that the impure syrup may run out. The base of these sugar loaves is then taken out, and white pulverized sugar substituted in its stead; which being well pressed down, the whole is covered with clay moistened with water. This water filters through the mass, carrying the syrup with it which was mixed with the sugar, but which by this management flows into a pot substituted in the place of the first. This second fluid is called fine syrup. Care is taken to moisten and keep the clay to a proper degree of softness as it becomes dry. The sugar loaves are afterwards taken out, and dried in a stove for eight or ten days; after which they are pulverized, packed, and exported to Europe, where they are still farther purified. The reason assigned why this process is not universally adopted in the British sugar islands is this, that the water which dilutes and carries away the molasses dissolves and carries with it so much of the sugar, that the difference in quality does not pay for the difference in quantity. The French planters probably think otherwise, upwards of 400 of the plantations of St Domingo having the necessary apparatus for claying and actually carrying on the system.\n\nThe art of refining sugar was first made known to the Europeans by a Venetian, who is said to have received refining for 100,000 crowns for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. This discovery was made before the new world was explored; but whether it was an invention of the person who first communicated it, or whether it was conveyed from China, where it had been known for a considerable time before, cannot now perhaps be accurately ascertained. We find no mention\nSugar.\n\nSugar. Mention made of the refining of sugar in Britain till the year 1659, though it probably was practiced several years before. For in the Portuguese island of St Thomas in 1624 there were 74 sugar ingenios, each having upwards of 200 slaves. The quantity of raw sugar imported into England in 1778 amounted to 1,403,995 cwts.; the quantity imported into Scotland in the same year was 117,285 cwts.; the whole quantity imported into Great Britain in 1787 was 1,926,741 cwts.\n\nThe sugar which undergoes the operation of refining in Europe is either raw sugar, sometimes called mucovado or caffonado, which is raw sugar in a purer state. The raw sugar generally contains a certain quantity of molasses as well as earthy and feculent substances. The caffonado, by the operation of earthing, is freed from its molasses. As the intention of refining these sugars is to give them a higher degree of whiteness and solidity, it is necessary for them to undergo other processes. The first of these is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLARIFICATION\">clarification</a>. It consists in dissolving the sugar in a certain proportion of lime-water, adding a proper quantity of bullock's blood, and exposing it to heat in order to remove the impurities which still remain. The heat is increased very gradually till it approaches that of boiling water. By the assistance of the heat, the animal matter which was thrown in coagulates, at the same time that it attracts all the solid feculent and earthy matter, and raises it to the surface in the appearance of a thick foam of a brownish colour. As the feculencies are never entirely removed by a first process, a second is necessary. The solution is therefore cooled to a certain degree by adding some water; then a fresh quantity of blood, but less considerable than at first, is poured in. The fire is renewed, and care is taken to increase the heat gently as before. The animal substance settles on the impurities which remain, collects them on the surface, and they are then skimmed off. The same operation is repeated a third and even a fourth time, but no addition is made to the liquor except water. If the different processes have been properly conducted, the solution will be freed from every impurity, and appear transparent. It is then conveyed by a gutter into an oblong balkeet about 16 inches deep, lined with a woollen cloth; and after filtering through this cloth, it is received in a cistern or copper which is placed below.\n\nThe solution being thus clarified, it undergoes a second general operation called evaporation. Fire is applied to the copper into which the solution was received, and the liquid is boiled till it has acquired the proper degree of consistence. A judgement is formed of this by taking up a small portion of the liquid and drawing it into a thread. When, after this trial, it is found sufficiently viscous, the fire is extinguished, and the liquid is poured into coolers. It is then stirred violently by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> called an ear, from the resemblance it bears to the oar of a boat. This is done in order to diminish the viscosity, and promote what is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANULATION\">granulation</a>, that is, the forming of it into grains or imperfect crystals. When the liquid is properly mixed and cooled, it is then poured into moulds of the form of a sugar loaf. These moulds are ranged in rows. The small ends, which are lowest, are placed in pots; and they have each of them apertures stopped up with linen for filtering the syrup, which runs from the moulds into the pots. The liquor is then taken out slowly in ladles from the coolers, and poured into the moulds. Sugar. When the moulds are filled, and the contents still in a fluid state, it is necessary to stir them, that no part may adhere to the moulds, and that the small crystals which pour into are just formed may be equally diffused through the moulds, whole mass. When the sugar is completely crystallized where the zed, the linen is taken away from the apertures in the syrup moulds, and the syrup, or that part which did not crystallize, descends into the pots in which the moulds are placed. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATION\">purgation</a> the moulds are removed and fixed in other pots, and a stratum of fine white clay diluted with water is laid on the upper part of the loaf. The water descending through the sugar by its own weight, mixes with the syrup which still remains in the body of the loaf, and washes it away. When the clay dries, it is taken off, and another covering of moist clay put in its place; and if it be not then sufficiently walled, a third covering of clay is applied. After the lastly exposed loaves have stood some days in the moulds, and have acquired a considerable degree of firmness and solidity, certain of them are taken out, and carried to a stove, where they are gradually heated to the 50\u00b0 of Reaumur (64\u00b0 of Fahrenheit), in order to dissipate any moisture which may be still confined in them. After remaining in the stove eight days, they are taken out; and after cutting off all discolouring specks, and the head if still wet, they are wrapped in blue paper, and are ready for sale. The several syrups collected during the different parts of the process, treated in the same manner which we have just described, afford sugars of inferior quality; and the last portion, which no longer affords any sugar, is sold by the name of molasses.\n\nThe beauty of refined sugar, when formed into loaves, consists in whiteness, joined to a smallness of grain; in the beauty being dry, hard, and somewhat transparent. The proof of sugar cells which we have described above refers to sugar once refined; but some more labour is necessary to produce how far double refined sugar. The principal difference in the other refined operation is this, the latter is clarified by white of eggs instead of blood, and fresh water in place of lime-water.\n\nSugar-candy is the true essence of the cane formed How into large crystals by a flow process. When the syrup sugar candy is well clarified, it is boiled a little, but not so much as is made, is done for the proof mentioned in the process for making common sugar. It is then placed in old moulds, having their lower ends stopped with linen, and crossed at little distances with small twigs to retain the sugar as it crystallizes. The moulds are then laid in a cool place. In proportion as the syrup cools crystals are formed. In about nine or ten days the moulds are carried to the stove, and placed in a pot; but the linen is not removed entirely, so that the syrup falls down slowly in drops. When the syrup has dropped away, and the crystals of the sugar-candy are become dry, the moulds are taken from the stove and broken in pieces, to disengage the sugar, which adheres strongly to the sides of the moulds. If the syrup has been coloured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, the crystals take a slight tinge of red; if indigo has been mixed, they assume a bluish colour. If it be desired to have the candy perfumed, the essence of flowers or amber may be dropped into the moulds along with the syrup.\n\nHaving now given some account of the method usually employed for refining sugar, it will not be im-\nproper to say a few things concerning its nature and its uses.\n\nSugar is soluble in water, and in a small degree in alcohol. When united with a small portion of water, it becomes fusible; from which quality the art of preserving is indebted for many of its preparations. It is phosphoric and combustible; when exposed to fire emitting a blue flame if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> be slow, and a white flame if the combustion be rapid. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> it produces a quantity of phlegm, acid, oil, gas, and charcoal. Bergman, in treating sugar with the nitrous acid, obtained a new acid now known by the name of the exotic acid: but he has omitted to mention the principles of which sugar is composed. Lavoisier, however, has supplied this omission; and after many experiments has assigned three principles in sugar, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbone. If the juice expressed from the sugar-cane be left to itself, it passes into the acetous fermentation; and during the decomposition of the sugar, which is continued for three or four months, a great quantity of glutinous matter is separated. This matter when distilled gives a portion of ammonia. If the juice be exposed to the spirituous fermentation, a wine is obtained analogous to cider. If this wine, after being kept in bottles a year, be distilled, we obtain a portion of eau de vie.\n\nThe uses to which sugar are applied are indeed numerous and important: It can be made so solid as in the art of preserving to receive the most agreeable colours and the greatest variety of forms. It can be made so fluid as to mix with any soluble substance.\u2014It preserves the juice and substance of fruits in all countries and in all seasons. It affords a delicious seasoning to many kinds of food. It is useful in pharmacy, for it unites with medicines, and removes their disagreeable flavour: it is the basis of all syrups. M. Macquer has shown in a very satisfactory manner how useful sugar would be if employed in fermenting wines. Sugar has also been found a remedy for the scurvy, and a valuable article of food in cases of necessity. M. Imbert de Lennes, first surgeon to the late duke of Orleans, published the following story in the Gazette de Sant\u00e9, which confirms this assertion. A vessel laden with sugar bound from the West Indies was becalmed in its passage for several days, during which the stock of provisions was exhausted. Some of the crew were dying of the scurvy, and the rest were threatened with a still more terrible death. In this emergency recourse was had to the sugar. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, the symptoms of the scurvy went off, the crew found it a wholesome and substantial aliment, and returned in good health to France.\n\n\"Sugar (says Dr Ruth) affords the greatest quantity of nourishment in a given quantity of matter of any substance in nature; of course it may be preserved in less room in our houses, and may be consumed in less time, than more bulky and less nourishing aliment. It has this peculiar advantage over most kinds of aliment, that it is not liable to have its nutritious qualities affected by time or the weather; hence it is preferred by the Indians in their excursions from home. They mix a certain quantity of maple sugar, with an equal quantity of Indian corn, dried and powdered, in its milky state. This mixture is packed in little baskets, which are frequently wetted in travelling, without injuring the sugar. A few spoonfuls of it mixed with half a pint of spring water afford them a pleasant and strengthening meal.\n\nFrom the degrees of strength and nourishment which are conveyed into animal bodies by a small bulk of sugar, it might probably be given to horses with great advantage, when they are used in places or under circumstances which make it difficult or expensive to support them with more bulky or weighty aliment. A pound of sugar with grass or hay has supported the strength and spirits of a horse during a whole day's labour in one of the West-India islands. A larger quantity given alone has fattened horses and cattle, during the war before last in Hispaniola, for a period of several months, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of sugar, and the importation of grain, were prevented by the want of ships.\n\n\"The plentiful use of sugar in diet is one of the best preventives that has ever been discovered of the diseases which are produced by worms. Nature seems to have implanted a love for this aliment in all children, as if it were on purpose to defend them from those diseases. Dr Ruth knew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, who early adopted this opinion, and who, by indulging a large family of children in the use of sugar, has preserved them all from the diseases usually occasioned by worms.\n\n\"Sir John Pringle has remarked, that the plague has never been known in any country where sugar composes a material part of the diet of the inhabitants. Dr Ruth thinks it probable that the frequency of malignant fevers of all kinds has been lessened by this diet, and that its more general use would defend that class of people who are most subject to malignant fevers from being so often affected by them.\n\n\"In the numerous and frequent disorders of the breast, which occur in all countries where the body is exposed to a variable temperature of weather, sugar affords the basis of many agreeable remedies. It is useful in weaknesses, and acid delusions upon other parts of the body. Many facts may be adduced in favour of this assertion. Dr Ruth mentions only one, which, from the venerable name of the person whose case furnished it, cannot fail of commanding attention and credit. Upon my inquiring of Dr Franklin, at the request of a friend (says our respectable author), about a year before he died, whether he had found any relief from the pain of the stone, the stone from the blackberry jam, of which he took large quantities, he told me that he had, but that he believed the medicinal part of the jam resided wholly in the sugar; and as a reason for thinking so, he added, that he often found the same relief by taking about half a pint of syrup, prepared by boiling a little brown sugar in water, just before he went to bed, that he did from a dose of opium. It has been supposed by some of the early physicians of our country, that the sugar obtained from the maple-tree is more medicinal than that obtained from the West India sugar-cane; but this opinion I believe is without foundation. It is preferable in its qualities to the West India sugar only from its superior cleanliness.\n\n\"Cases may occur in which sugar may be required in medicine, or in diet, by persons who refuse to be benefited, even indirectly by the labour of slaves. In such cases the innocent maple sugar will always be preferred. It has been said, that sugar injures the teeth; but this opinion now has so few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, that it does not deserve a serious refutation.\"\nIn the account which we have given above of the method of cultivating and manufacturing sugar, we have had in our eye the plantations in the West Indies, where slaves alone are employed; but we feel a peculiar pleasure in having it in our power to add a short description of the method used in the East Indies, because there sugar is manufactured by free men, on a plan which is much more economical than what is followed in the West Indies. The account which we mean to give is an extract from the report of the committee of Privy-council for trade on the subject of the African slave-trade, drawn up by Mr Batham. We shall give it in the author's own words.\n\n\"Having been for two years in the English and French West India islands, and since conducted sugar estates in the East Indies; before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of the slave-trade was agitated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, it may be desirable to know that sugar of a superior quality and inferior price to that in our islands is produced in the East Indies; that the culture of the cane, the manufacture of the sugar and arrack, is, with these material advantages, carried on by free people. China, Bengal, the coast of Malabar, all produce quantities of sugar and spirits; but as the most considerable growth of the cane is carried on near Batavia, I shall explain the improved manner in which sugar estates are there conducted. The proprietor of the estate is generally a wealthy Dutchman, who has erected on it substantial mills, boiling and curing houses. He rents this estate to a Chinese, who resides on it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERINTENDENT\">superintendent</a>; and this renter (supposing the estate to consist of 300 or more acres) relents it to free men in parcels of 50 or 60 on these conditions: 'That they shall plant it in canes, and receive so much per pecul of 133\u00bd pounds for every pecul of sugar that the canes shall produce.'\n\nWhen crop time comes on, the superintendent collects a sufficient number of persons from the adjacent towns or villages, and takes off his crop as follows. To any set of tradesmen who bring their carts and buffaloes he agrees to give such a price per pecul to cut all his crop of canes, carry them to the mill and grind them. A second to boil them per pecul. A third to clay them and basket them for market per pecul. So that by this method of conducting a sugar estate the renter knows to a certainty what the produce of it will cost him per pecul. He has not any permanent or unnecessary expense; for when the crop is taken off, the taskmen return to their several pursuits in the towns and villages they came from; and there only remain the cane planters who are preparing the next year's crop. This like all other complex arts, by being divided into several branches, renders the labour cheaper and the work more perfectly done.\n\nOnly clayed sugars are made at Batavia; these are in quality equal to the best from the West Indies, and are sold so low from the sugar estates as eighteen shillings sterling per pecul of 133\u00bd lbs. This is not the selling price to the trader at Batavia, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> there is arbitrary, and sugar subject to duties imposed at will. The Shabander exacts a dollar per pecul on all sugar exported. The price of common labour is from 9d. to 10d. per day. By the method of carrying on the sugar estates, the taskmen gain considerably more than this not only from working extraordinary hours, but from being considered artists in their several branches. They do not make spirits sugar on the sugar estates. The molasses is sent for sale to Batavia, where one distillery may purchase the produce of an hundred estates. Here is a vast saving and reduction of the price of spirits; not as in the West Indies, a distillery, for each estate; many centre in one, and arrack is sold at Batavia from 21 to 25 rixdollars per leaguer of 160 gallons; say 8d. per gallon.\"\n\nThe SUGAR MAPLE, (the acer saccharinum of Lin-Description), as well as the sugar-cane, produces a great quantity of sugar. This tree grows in great numbers in the western counties of all the middle states of the American union. Those which grow in New York and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a> yield the sugar in a greater quantity than those which grow on the waters of the Ohio.\u2014These trees are generally found mixed with the beech, hemlock, white and water ash, the cucumber tree, linden, aspen, butternut, and wild cherry trees. They sometimes appear in groves covering five or six acres in a body, but they are more commonly interspersed with some or all of the forest trees which have been mentioned. From 30 to 50 trees are generally found upon an acre of ground. They grow only in the richest American soils, and frequently in stony ground. Springs of the purest water abound in their neighbourhood. They are, when fully grown, as tall as the white and black oaks, vol. iii., and from two to three feet in diameter. They put forth a beautiful white blossom in the spring before they show a single leaf. The colour of the blossom distinguishes them from the acer rubrum, or the common maple, which affords a blossom of a red colour. The wood of the sugar maple-tree is extremely inflammable, and is preferred upon that account by hunters and surveyors for fire-wood. Its small branches are so much impregnated with sugar as to afford support to the cattle, horses, and sheep of the first settlers, during the winter, before they are able to cultivate forage for that purpose. Its ashes afford a great quantity of potash, exceeded by few, or perhaps by none, of the trees that grow in the woods of the United States. The tree is supposed to arrive at its full growth in the woods in twenty years.\n\nIt is not injured by tapping; on the contrary, the more often it is tapped, the more syrup is obtained from it. In this respect it follows a law of animal secretion. A single tree had not only survived, but flourished after syrup is obtained from the yearly discharge of sap from the tree, in improving and increasing the sap, are demonstrated from the superior excellence of those trees which have been perforated in an hundred places, by a small wood-pecker which feeds upon the sap. The trees, after having been wounded in this way, distil the remains of their juice on the ground, and afterwards acquire a black colour. The sap of these trees is much sweeter to the taste than that which is obtained from trees which have not been previously wounded, and it affords more sugar.\n\nFrom twenty-three gallons and one quart of sap, procured in twenty-four hours from only two of these dark coloured trees, Arthur Noble, Esq. of the state of New York, obtained four pounds and thirteen ounces of good grained sugar.\n\nA tree of an ordinary size yields in a good season from twenty to thirty gallons of sap, from which are made from five to six pounds of sugar. To this there are sometimes\ntimes remarkable exceptions. Samuel Lowe, Esq., a justice of peace in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a> county, in the state of New York, informed Arthur Noble, Esq., that he had made twenty pounds and one ounce of sugar between the 14th and 23rd of April, in the year 1789, from a single tree that had been tapped for several successive years before.\n\nFrom the influence which culture has upon forest and other trees, it has been supposed, that by transplanting the sugar maple-tree into a garden, or by destroying such other trees as shelter it from the rays of the sun, the quantity of the sap might be increased, and its quality much improved. A farmer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a> county, in the state of Pennsylvania, planted a number of these trees above twenty years ago in his meadow, from three gallons of the sap of which he obtains every year a pound of sugar. It was observed formerly, that it required five or six gallons of the sap of the trees which grow in the woods to produce the same quantity of sugar.\n\nThe sap diffuses from the wood in the spring months. Trees which have been cut down in the winter for the support of the domestic animals of the new settlers, yield a considerable quantity of sap as soon as their trunks and limbs feel the rays of the sun in the spring of the year. It is in consequence of the sap of these trees being equally diffused through every part of them, that they live three years after they are girdled, that is, after a circular incision is made through the bark into the substance of the tree for the purpose of destroying it. It is remarkable that grafts thrive better under this tree in a meadow, than in situations exposed to the constant action of the sun. The season for tapping the trees is in February, March, and April, according to the weather which occurs in these months.\n\nWarm days and frothy nights are most favourable to a plentiful discharge of sap. The quantity obtained in a day from a tree is from five gallons to a pint, according to the greater or less heat of the air. Mr. Lowe informed Arthur Noble, Esq., that he obtained near three and twenty gallons of sap in one day (April 14, 1789,) from the single tree which was before mentioned. Such instances of a profusion of sap in single trees are however not very common.\n\nThere is always a suspension of the discharge of sap in the night if a frost succeed a warm day. The perforation in the tree is made with an axe or an auger. The latter is preferred from experience of its advantages. The auger is introduced about three quarters of an inch, and in an ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> (that the sap may not be frozen in a slow current in the mornings or evenings), and is afterwards deepened gradually to the extent of two inches. A spout is introduced about half an inch into the hole made by this auger, and projects from three to twelve inches from the tree. The spout is generally made of the hawthorn or elder, which usually grows in the neighbourhood of the sugar trees. The tree is first tapped on the south side; when the discharge of its sap begins to lessen, an opening is made on the north side, from which an increased discharge takes place. The sap flows from four to six weeks, according to the temperature of the weather. Troughs large enough to contain three or four gallons made of white pine, or white ash, or of dried water ash, aspen, linden, poplar, or common maple, are placed under the spout to receive the sap, which is carried every day to a large receiver, made of either of the trees before mentioned. From this receiver it is conveyed, after being strained, to the boiler.\n\nWe understand that there are three modes of reducing the sap to sugar; by evaporation, by freezing, and by boiling; of which the latter is most general, as being the most expeditious. We are farther assured, that the profit of the maple tree is not confined to its sugar. It affords most agreeable melodies, and an excellent vinegar. The sap which is suitable for these purposes is obtained after the sap which affords the sugar has ceased to flow, so that the manufacturers of these different products of the maple tree, by succeeding, do not interfere with each other. The melodies may be made to compose the basis of a pleasant summer beer. The sap of the maple is moreover capable of affording a spirit; but we hope this precious juice will never be prostituted to this ignoble purpose. Should the use of sugar in diet become more general in this country (says Dr. Rush) it may tend to lessen the inclination or supposed necessity for spirits, for I have observed a relish for sugar in diet to be seldom accompanied by a love for strong drink.\n\nThere are several other vegetables raised in our own country which afford sugar; as beet-roots, skirrets, parsnips, potatoes, celery, red cabbage stalks, the young shoots of Indian wheat. The sugar is most readily obtained from these, by making a tincture of the subject in rectified spirit of wine; which, when saturated by heat, will deposit the sugar upon standing in the cold.\n\nSugar of Milk.

The safe way would be to rake out all half-burnt coal before shutting up the doors.\n\nIf we use raw pit-coal, great care is necessary to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of heat in the upper part of the stove. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> place for the chimney-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a>; and if we attempt to burn it out, we run a great risk of splitting that part of the stove which is the most slightly constructed. It is advisable therefore to burn it away every day, by giving a brisk draught with an open door for five minutes. With wood or coak there is no danger.\n\nIt will not be improper in this place to give some instructions for the construction of stoves for warming several floors in a great manufactory, such as a cotton-mill, or a public library or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a>.\n\nIn such situations we think cleanliness, wholesomeness, and sweetness of air, no less necessary than in the drawing-room of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of opulence. We therefore recommend the brick-stove in preference to the iron one; and though it would not be the best or most economical practice to heat it but once a-day, and we should rather prefer the German practice of constant feeding, we still think it highly proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> the heat to a very moderate degree, and employ a large surface.\n\nIf the disposition of the rooms allows us the convenience of a thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>-wall, we would place the stove in the middle of this wall, in an arch which pierces through the wall. Immediately above this arch we would carry up a very wide chimney through the whole height. This chimney must have a passage opening into each floor on both sides, which may be very accurately shut up by a door. The stove being set up under the arch, it must have a pipe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with its flue, and rising up through this chimney. Could an earthen pipe be properly supported, and secured from splitting by hoops, we should prefer it for the reasons already given. But as this is perhaps expecting too much, we must admit the use of a cast-iron pipe. This is the real chimney or flue of the stove, and must be of as great diameter as possible, that it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, by an extensive surface, all the way up.\n\nThe stove stands under the arch in the wall; but the air that is warmed by its surface would escape on both sides, and would be expended in that single floor. To prevent this, the stove must be inclosed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>; this may be of brick-work, at the distance of two or three inches from the stove all round. It must be well shut in above, and at the foundation must have a row of small holes to admit the air all around it. This air will then be warmed over the whole space between the stove and the cage, past up the chimney, and there receive additional heat from the flue-pipe which is in the middle. Great care must be taken that the fire-place door have no communication with the space between the stove and its cage, but be inclosed in a mouth-piece which comes through the cage, and opens into the feeding-room. Thus all the air which goes up to the rooms will be pure and wholesome, provided we take care that everything be kept clean and sweet about the air-holes below. Observe that those air-holes which are near the furnace door must be inclosed in a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> which takes in its air at some distance from this door; for since the current between the stove and cage may be almost as great as the current within the stove (nay, when a puff of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> beats down the chimney, it may even exceed it), there is a risk of some vitiated air and smoke being drawn into the cage.\n\nIf the stove cannot be placed in the arch of a party-wall, it may be set adjoining to a side or outer wall, and furnished with a cage, a large chimney, and a flue-pipe, in the same manner. But in this case a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of heat is wasted on this outer wall, and carried off by the external air. In this situation we would recommend to line that part of the wall which is behind the stove (at two or three inches distance), and the whole of the chimney, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> on laths. These should be nailed on battens properly fastened on the wall, leaving a space of an inch between the laths and the wall. The plaster should be of the most spungy kind, having in it a quantity of clay in powder instead of the full proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">Horse</a>-dung, washed with water and strained through coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a>, leaves a great portion of unaffiliated vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, which will mix very intimately in the plaster, and make it a substance very unfit for conducting heat. There is no danger of catching fire by this lining. We have seen a most tremendous fire rage for three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, in contact with a partition of lath and plaster (on the plaster-side however), without discolouring the thin laths on the other side. We once <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a cottage chimney on fire, and burn till the foot was consumed. This chimney was nothing but a pipe of a foot wide, made of laths, and plastered on the inside and outside; and it passed through a thatched roof. We therefore recommend this in place of the brick-cage for inclosing the stove. It would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> heat; and as it might\nbe made in pieces on detached frames, which could be joined by iron straps and hinges, any part of the stove could be laid open for repairs at pleasure.\n\nWe have no hesitation in saying that a stove constructed in this manner would be greatly superior in power to any we have seen, and would be free from many of their disgusting defects. We beg leave therefore to introduce here the description of one which was to have been erected in one of the churches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>.\n\nFig. 4. is a sketch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> contained in the parallelogram AFED. P marks the place of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a>, and LMNO the front of the galleries. These are carried back to the side-walls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> and DC. But at the end opposite to the pulpit they do not reach so far, but leave a space BFEC about 12 feet wide. Below the back of the galleries, on each side, there is a passage ABGH, KICD, separated from the heated part of the church by partitions which reach from the floor to the galleries, so that the space HGIK is completely shut in. The church is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> building, of a light and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a> structure, having two rows of large windows above the arcades, and a spacious window in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> end above the pulpit. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> complain of a cold air, which they feel pouring down upon their heads. This is more particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> by those sitting in the fronts of the galleries. We imagine that this arises chiefly from the extensive surface of the upper row of windows, and of the cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-walls above, which rob the air of its heat as it glides up along the sides of the church. It becomes heavier by collapsing, and in this state defends in the middle of the church.\n\nThe stove S is placed against the middle of the west wall at the distance of a few inches, and is completely inclosed in a case of lath and plaster. The vent, which is to carry off the smoke and burnt air, is conveyed up or along the wall, and through the roof or side-wall, but without any communication with the case. In like manner the fire-place door is open to the passage, without communicating with the case; and care is taken that the holes which admit the air into the case are so disposed that they shall run no risk of drawing in any air from the fire-place door.\n\nFrom the top of this case proceed two trunks Q, R, each of which is two feet broad and six inches deep, coated within and without with the most flouncy plaster that can be composed. For this purpose we should recommend a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of powdered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> and as much clay and quicklime as will give it a very slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>. We know that a piece of this may be held in the hand, without inconvenience, within an inch of where it is of a glowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat.\u2014These trunks open into another trunk XVTYZ, which ranges along the partition immediately under the galleries, and may be formed externally into a corniche, a little massive indeed, but not unsightly in a building of this style. This trunk is coated in the same manner. It has several openings a, a, &c., which have sliders that can be drawn aside by means of handles accessible from the outer passage.\u2014At the extremities X and Z of this trunk are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> trunks which come up through the galleries, and are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to a considerable height. At their junction with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> trunk are two doors large enough to admit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>. Each perpendicular trunk has also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> by which it can be completely flopped.\n\nThe stove is managed as follows: Early in the morning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERINTENDENT\">superintendent</a> shuts all the sliders, and sets a lamp (burning) in each of the trunks X and Z, and shuts the doors. He then puts on and kindles the fire in the stove, and manages it either in the Russian or German method. Perhaps the latter is preferable, as being liable to fewer accidents from mistake or neglect.\n\nThe lamps set in the lower ends of the upright trunks presently warm them, and produce a current of air upwards. This must be supplied by the horizontal trunk, which must take it from the case round the stove. Thus a current is begun in the direction we wish. By and by the air in the case acquires heat from the stove, and the current becomes extremely brisk. When the manager perceives this, he removes the lamps, shuts the valves, and opens the holes a, a, &c., beginning with the most remote, and proceeding slowly towards the stove from each extremity of the horizontal branches. The heated air now issues by these holes, glides along the ceiling below the galleries, and escapes, by rising up along the fronts of the galleries, and will be sensibly felt by those sitting there, coming on their faces with a gentle warmth. It will then rise (in great part) straight up, while some of it will glide backwards, to the comfort of those who sit behind.\n\nThe propriety of shutting the valves of the upright trunks is evident. If they were left open, no air would come out by the holes a, a, &c.; but, on the contrary, the air would go in at these holes to supply the current, and the stove be rendered useless. The air delivered by these holes will keep close to the ceiling, and will not, as we imagine, inconvenience those who sit below the galleries. But if it should be found to render these parts too warm, holes may be pierced through the ceiling, by which it will rise among the people above, and must be very comfortable. It will require the careful attention of some intelligent person to bring all this into a proper train at first, by finding the proper apertures of the different holes, so as to render the heat equable through the whole space. But this being once ascertained the difficulty is over.\n\nThe air trunks must be very capacious, but may be contracted towards the extremities as their lateral discharges diminish; and the row of holes which admit the air to the case round the stove must be fully able to supply them.\n\nIt must be observed, that in this construction the ascensional force is but small. It is only the height of a short column of warm air from the ground to the galleries. At first indeed it is great, having the unlimited height of the perpendicular trunks at X and Z; but during the use of the stove it is reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten feet. It is necessary, therefore, that the stove be highly heated, perhaps considerably beyond the Russian practice, but yet inferior to the heat of the German iron stoves. But still we strongly recommend the brick or pottery stoves, on account of the wholesome sweetness of the air which they furnish; and we are certain that a stove of moderate dimensions, eight feet long, for instance, by eight feet high, will be sufficient for warming a church holding 1200 or 1500 people. If the stove could be placed lower, which in many situations is very practicable, its effect would be proportionally greater, because all depends on the rapidity of the current. When we are limited in height, we must extend the\nstove so much the more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and make the air trunks more capacious. These and many other circumstances of local modification must be attended to by the erecter of the stove; and without the judicious attention of an intelligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, we may expect nothing but disappointment. It is hardly possible to give instructions suited to every situation; but a careful attention to the general principle which determines the accidental force will free the artist from any great risk of failure.\n\nWe may say the same thing of stoves for conservatories, hot-houses, hot walls, &c., and can hardly add anything of consequence to what we have already said on these heads in the article PNEUMATICS.\n\nWe must not, however, dismiss the subject without taking notice of the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> projects which have been frequently offered for drying malt by stoves. Many of these are to be seen in the publications of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">Academies</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, Upsal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>; and some have been erected in this kingdom, but they have not been found to answer.\n\nWe apprehend that they cannot answer. To dry malt, and make it fit for the ales and beers for which this island is so famous, it is by no means enough that we give it a proper and an equable supply of heat.\u2014This alone would bake it and make it flinty, causing the moisture to penetrate the mealy particles of the grain; and, by completely dissolving the soluble parts, would render each kernel an uniform mass, which would dry into a flinty grain, breaking like a piece of glass.\u2014A grain of malt is not an inert pulp. It is a seed, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> state, growing, and of an organized structure. We wish to stop it in this state, and kill it, not by heating it, but by abstracting its moisture. We thus leave it in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> or organized form, springy, and fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMBIBING\">imbibing</a> water in the mash tub, without running into a paste.\n\nTo accomplish these purposes, the construction of our malt kilns seems very well adapted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILN\">kiln</a> is the only flue of the furnace, and a copious current of air is formed through among the grains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> off with it the water which is evaporating by the heat. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, being chiefly in consequence of the vapour being immediately dissolved by the passing air, will stop as soon as the current of air stops. This current has to make its way through moist grain, laid in a pretty thick bed, and matted together. Some force, therefore, is necessary to drive it through. This is furnished by the draught of the kiln. Substituting a stove, immediately applied to the malt, will not have this effect. The only way in which we think this can be done different from the present, is to have a horizontal flue, as has been proposed in these projects, spread out at a small distance below the grate on which the malt is laid, and to cover the whole with a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>, like a glass-house dome. This being filled with a tall column of hot air, and having no passage into it but through the malt, would produce the current which we want. We are convinced that this will make much less fuel serve; but we are by no means certain that the sulphurous and carbonic acid which accompanies the air in our common kiln is not a necessary or a useful ingredient in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. It is well known that different coals, cinders, or charcoal, impart different qualities to the malts, and are preferred each for its own purpose.\n\nA stove constructed on similar principles, but composed of very different materials, has been lately erected in several of the churches in Edinburgh. This stove, which is formed entirely of cast iron, may be considered as a double stove, an outer case, and a furnace or inner stove. The fuel is burnt in the inner stove; and the smoke produced during the process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, is carried off by a chimney, which passes through the top of the outer stove, and is conveyed to the outside of the building. The outer case includes not only the furnace or inner stove, but also a considerable space, occupied by the air of the atmosphere, which is freely admitted through a number of openings placed around it; and when any current of air is produced, it passes off from the space between the outer case and inner stove, and is conveyed by tubes through the body of the apartment. But we shall first describe the different parts of which the stove is composed, after which we shall be better able to understand its mode of operation.\n\nFig. 5. exhibits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of this stove. AB is the body, which is about three feet high, and of a circular form. BC is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a> on which the stove is placed, and which contains the ash pit DD. The height of the pedestal is about a foot, and it is nearly insulated by resting on the spherical supports <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">aa</a>, also of cast iron. EEE are openings in front of the ash pit through which the air enters to support the combustion. These openings can be enlarged or diminished, or opened and shut at pleasure. FF is the door of the furnace through which the fuel is introduced. This door is attached to the inner furnace, and is double. It is one foot broad, and 11 inches high. GG is the chimney, which passes from the furnace within, through the outer case, and conveys the smoke out of the building. HH are openings in the outer case, and are eight in number, through which the air enters, and being heated, is greatly rarified, and passes off through the funnel or pipe IIII. This pipe communicates only with the outer stove, and being shut at the end K, the air rushes out from the small tubes LL, inserted into the side of the pipe IIII, and thus mixes with the cold air of the church. The diameter of the outer case at the bottom is about two feet, and the diameter of the furnace within is about 16 inches.\n\nFig. 6. is a section of the stove. AB is the outer case, from which passes off the pipe or funnel CCC, by which the heated air is conveyed through the church. DD is the furnace in the inside, in which the fuel is burnt, and EEE is the chimney or funnel which conveys the smoke from the inner furnace out of the building. It passes through the outer stove AB at F.\n\nFig. 7. is a plan of this stove. AB is the pedestal on which it rests, and which contains the ash pit. CC is the outer case, and DD is the furnace within, in which are seen the transverse bars which support the fuel.\n\nThe length of the body of the church, in which two stoves of the form and dimensions now described are erected, is about 60 feet, and the breadth is about 45 feet. The tubes IIII are conveyed along the lower edge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>, about half the length of the church. The fires are lighted up about four or five o'clock on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> morning, during the earlier part of the cold season; but as the season advances, it is usual to light them up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> before. From this time till the congregation assemble for the afternoon service, the furnaces are\nare kept constantly supplied with fuel. By this management the air in the church is kept comfortably warm during the coldest season of the year.\n\nThese stoves, it appears to us, are susceptible of some improvement, both in their construction and in the places in which they are erected. With regard to the first circumstance, an external coating of plaster work, or of the same kind of materials as are used for coating the inside of chemical furnaces, would be of some use in preventing an unnecessary waste of heat, as well as the disagreeable smell which is sometimes complained of, and which is supposed to arise from the combustion of light bodies floating in the air and drawn by the current to the heated metal; and with regard to the last, viz., the places in which they are erected, it is perfectly obvious that they ought to be as completely insulated as possible, and particularly ought not to communicate with any body which is a good conductor of heat. Some of the stoves erected in the churches of Edinburgh, which we have examined, are faulty in this respect. One in particular is placed in close contact with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GABLE\">gable</a> wall.\n\nThe quantity of coals consumed in two of these stoves in one of the churches of Edinburgh during the course of a season, we have been informed, amounts to about five carts of 12 cwt. each; so that at the Edinburgh prices of coal, the expense for fuel for heating one of the churches is about 50 shillings. This being added to the expenses of attendance, includes the whole expenditure, besides some occasional repairs which are required in heating a church of the above dimensions.\n\nThe following is the description of an improved stove by Mr Field of Newman Street <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in which, it is stated by the author, the various advantages of heating, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>, steaming, evaporating, drying, ventilating, &c., are united; some of which we shall detail in his own words.\n\n\"Fig. 8 represents a longitudinal section of the stove, showing the course of the air from its entrance into the flues of the stove at A, to its entrance into the upper chamber of the stove at B; and also the course of the smoke from the fire-place at C, till it escapes from the stove at D. E, E, are the doors or openings of the fire-place and ash-hole.\n\n\"Fig. 9. is a similar section at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the above, exhibiting the course of the air through the chambers of the stove, from its entrance into the chamber No. 1, at B to its entrance beneath the fire-place at F. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> also shows sections of the flues, with the divisions through which the air and smoke <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> separately, the smoke-flue in the centre, and the air-flues on each side. G, G, are doors and openings through which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> to be dried are introduced into the chambers.\n\n\"When the fire is lighted, and the doors of the chambers, ash hole, and fire-place, closed, the air by which the fire is supplied enters at A, fig. 8, passes through the air-flues a, a, a, enters the upper chamber at B, traverses and descends through the chambers No. 1, 2, 3, and arrives beneath the fire at F, fig. 9. Having supplied the fire with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, it passes through the flue with the smoke, and escapes at D, heating in its protracted course the chambers and air-flues.\n\n\"As the cold air enters the stove at A, immediately above a plate forming the top of the fire-place, and pursues a similar route with the fire-flue, it enters the chambers very much heated and rarefied. Hence any moist substance placed in the chambers evaporates in consequence, not only of the heated flues circulating round them, but of a stream of warm rarefied air, which, while it continually raises evaporation, as continually bears away the exhaled moisture in its passage to the fire, thus imitating the gradual and efficacious plan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in drying by the sun and air. While these effects are taking place within the stove, part of the air which enters at A, fig. 8, and 9, passes through air-flues on the other side of the fire-flue, pursues a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> course with the first, and gives out a current of warm air to the room at an aperture H. This effect may be obtained in a much higher degree, if the doors of the chambers and ash-hole are opened: should the hand or face be then brought near, they would be fanned with a stream of warm air, especially from the upper chamber.\n\n\"By means of this stove I have evaporated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> to dryness, without burning or discolouring it; and have dried cherries, plums, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, so as to imitate those which are received from abroad. I have repeatedly dried colours and the most delicate substances without the slightest injury, even though the operation proceeded quickly.\n\n\"The height of the stove is about five feet and a half; its diameter two feet and a half, and that of the flues four inches. The external part is constructed of brick, and the internal parts of thin Rye gate or fire-stone, except the top of the fire-place, which is a plate of cast iron. Were it to be wholly formed of iron, its effects would necessarily be more powerful.\n\n\"Fig. 10. represents an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the plan, in which stoves of this kind may be advantageously connected with one or more furnaces for chemical or other uses. The fire-place, brought out, either in front or on one side, by the present positions of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> 1, forms a reverberatory furnace, or will make a sand-bath by reverberating it.\n\n\"The space occupied by the fire-place in fig. 8, may in this be converted into apartments for evaporating substances, or occasionally for cooling them by an opening at K to admit cold air, while the warm air of the stove is excluded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> or door. The dotted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> show the manner in which a second furnace may be connected by an opening into the flue at L.\n\n\"In addition to the uses already pointed out, this stove would probably be found extremely serviceable in drying japanners' goods, and containing the noxious fumes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> which arise from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> used in this business.\n\n\"Since the stove is not limited to any certain dimensions, it might be adapted to the drying of malt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>, perhaps of herbs, corn, and seeds generally. It might also be accommodated to the purposes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAKERS\">bakers</a>, connected with the great fires they employ for their boilers. It has been shown to be useful in the confectioners' art, and probably it may be equally so in baking biscuits for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>; nor less so in drying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> for the laundress, dyer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALICO\">calico</a>-printer, and bleacher.

Of the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> we know very little, except that he was bred to his father's business, which in the year 1560 he relinquished, devoting himself entirely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> historians, chronicles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a>, charters, registers, and records. Of these he made a considerable collection, travelling for that purpose to different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, and transcribing such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> as he could not purchase. But this profession of an antiquary being attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>, he was obliged for subsistence to return to his trade.\u2014It happened, however, that his talents and necessities were made known to Dr Parker <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>; who being himself an antiquary, encouraged and enabled Mr Stow to prosecute his darling study. In those times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> was then upon the throne, honest John Stow did not escape danger. His collection of Popish records was deemed cause of suspicion. His younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Thomas preferred no less than 140 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> against him before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> being insufficient, he was acquitted. In 1565 he first published his Summary of the Chronicles of England. About the year 1581 he began his Survey of London. In 1583 he was one of the two collectors for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> mutter of Limehouse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a>: in the same year he petitioned the corporation of London to befallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> him the benefit of two freemen, to enable him to publish his survey; and in 1589 he petitioned again for a pension. Whether he succeeded, is not known. He was principally concerned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition of Holinshed's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a>, published in 1587. He also corrected, and twice augmented, Chaucer's works, published in 1561 and in 1597. His survey of London was first published in 1598. To these laborious works he would have added his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> Chronicle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of England; but he lived only to publish an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of it, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Flores Historiarum. The folio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, which was printed after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, with the title of Stow's Chronicle, was taken from his papers by Edmund Howes.

Sober, diligent, and attentive, while his emoluments were for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> very scanty, he contrived to live rather within than beyond his income; and though he married early, and without such a provision as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> might have looked for in the establishment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to thrive, and to better his circumstances.

Mr Strahan's queries to Dr Franklin in the year 1769, reflecting the discontentments of the Americans, published in the London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a> of 28th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1778, show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> he entertained of the important consequences of that dispute, and his anxiety as a good subject to investigate, at that early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the proper means by which their grievances might be removed, and a permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> restored between the two countries. In the year 1775 he was elected a member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGH\">borough</a> of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, with a very illustrious colleague, the Hon. C. J. Fox; and in the succeeding parliament, for Wootton Bassett, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. In this station, applying himself with that industry which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to him, he was a useful member, and attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> with scrupulous punctuality. His talents for business acquired the consideration to which they were entitled, and were not unnoticed by the minister.\n\nIn his political connection he was constant to the friends to whom he had first been attached. He was a steady supporter of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> who were turned out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> 1784, and lost his seat in the house of commons by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of parliament with which that change was followed: a situation which he did not shew any desire to resume on the return of the new parliament; arising from a feeling of some decline in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, which had rather suffered from the long fittings and late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> with which the political warfare in the preceding had been attended. Without any fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, his strength visibly declined; and though his spirits survived his strength, yet the vigour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of his mind were considerably impaired. Both continued gradually to decline till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened on the 9th of July 1785 in the 71st year of his age.\n\nEndued with much natural sagacity, and an attentive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of life, he owed his rise to that station of opulence and respect which he attained, rather to his own talents and exertion, than to any accidental occurrence of favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fortunate circumstances. His mind was not unformed by letters; and from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, he acquired a considerable portion of critical acuteness in the discernment of its beauties and defects. In one branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> he particularly excelled\u2014the epistolary; in which he not only showed the precision and clearness of business, but possessed a neatness as well as a fluency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>-writers have been known to surpass. Letter-writing was one of his favourite amusements; and among his correspondents were men of such eminence and talents as well repaid his endeavours to entertain them. Among these, as before mentioned, was the justly celebrated Dr Franklin, originally a printer like Mr Strahan, whose friendship and correspondence, notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their sentiments in political matters,\nhe continued to enjoy till his death. One of the latest letters which he received from his illustrious and venerable friend contained a humorous allegory of the state of politics in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, drawn from the profession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>; of which, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> had quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, he had not forgotten the terms.\n\nThe judicious disposition which Mr Strahan made of his property, affords an evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and propriety. After providing sufficiently for his widow and children, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> seems to have been to mitigate the affliction of those (and many there were) who would more immediately have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> his loss, by bequeathing them liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a> for their lives; and (recalling that all of a profession are not equally provident) he left \u00a31000. to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of Stationers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to be divided among inform old printers.\n\nAs the virtuous connections of the life and the heart are always pleasing to trace,\u2014of Mr Strahan it may briefly be said, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, diligence, and probity, raised him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his profession. The good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> and obliging disposition which he owed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, he cultivated with care, and confirmed by habit. His sympathetic heart <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> time to the joy and sorrow of his friends. His advice was always ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, and his purse open to relieve indigence. Living in times not the purest in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a>, he escaped unfulfilled through the artifices of trade and the corruption of politics. In him a strong natural figuracy, improved by an extensive knowledge of the world, served only to render respectable his unaffected simplicity of manners, and to make his Christian philanthropy more discerning and useful. The uninterrupted health and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> which accompanied him for half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, proves honesty to be the best policy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> duties of life its most agreeable amusement. In his elevated fortune, none of his former acquaintance ever accused him of neglect. He attained prosperity without envy, enjoyed wealth without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, and dispensed bounty without ostentation.","sp":374,"ep":375},{"h":"STRAIKS","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> art, are strong plates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, fixed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, fixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a> called straik-naits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the circumference of a cannon-wheel, over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> of the fellows; both to strengthen the wheel, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the fellows from wearing on hard ways <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> streets.","sp":375,"ep":375},{"h":"STRAIN","t":"Stress, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>, are terms indiscriminately used to express the force which is excited in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a machine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> structure of any kind tending to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> it in that part. Thus every part of a rope is equally strained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> which it suspends.

A mill axle is equally twisted and strained in every part which lies between the part of the wheel actuated by the moving power and the part which is resisted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> to be performed.

It was from Le Bas he had the first hint of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called the dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>; but which he afterwards greatly improved by his own genius, and which has added such superior beauties to his engravings.\n\nIn the year 1751 Mr Strange removed with his family from Edinburgh and settled at London, where he engraved several fine historical prints, which justly acquired to him great reputation. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> historical engraving had made little progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, and he may be properly considered as its father.\n\nThe admiration he always had for the works of the great Italian painters made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> desire to visit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, the seat of the fine arts; and the farther he advanced in life, he became the more persuaded that a journey to that country was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to an artist who had the laudable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> to excel in his profession. He therefore undertook this journey in the year 1760. In Italy he made many admirable drawings, several of which he afterwards engraved. These drawings are now in the possession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Dundas.\n\nEverywhere in Italy singular marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> were bestowed on Mr Strange; not only by great personages, but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> of the fine arts in that country. He was made a member of the academies of Rome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, and professor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> academy at Parma.\n\nTo show the estimation in which his talents were held at Rome, we cannot but record the following anecdote. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> of the room of the Vatican library, in which the collection of engravings is kept, is elegantly painted by Signor Rotarielli. It represents the portraits of engravers; and the portraits of the most eminent artists in that line are there introduced, among which is that of our artist. Under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> he holds a portfolio, on which his name is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a>. He is the only British artist on whom this honour has been conferred.\n\nIn France, where he resided many years at different periods, his talents likewise received every mark of attention that could be bestowed on a foreigner. He was made a member of the royal academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> at Paris.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> George III., ever attentive to the progress of the fine arts in Britain, and sensible of the advantages of which engraving particularly has been to\nStrange. this country, even in a commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; and desirous to give a mark of his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of the merit of Mr Strange, whom he considered as at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his profession and the great improver of it\u2014was graciously pleased to confer the honour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> on him the 5th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1787.\n\nSuch was Sir Robert Strange as an artist; nor was he less distinguished by his truly amiable moral qualities, which endeared him to all who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> to know him.\n\nWith regard to his works, he left fifty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> plates, still in good condition, which are carefully preserved in his family. They are engraved from pictures by the most celebrated painters of the Roman, Florentine, Lombard, Venetian, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. They are historical, both sacred and profane, poetical, allegorical.\n\nFrom his earliest establishment in life, Sir Robert carefully preserved about eighty copies of the finest and most choice impressions of each plate he engraved; which, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time, have acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, mellowness, and brilliancy, easier seen than described. He did this with a view of presenting them to the public at a period when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> should disable him from adding to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. These he collected into as many volumes, and arranged them in the order in which they were engraved. To each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> he prefixed two portraits of himself, on the same plate, the one an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETCHING\">etching</a>, the other a finished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, from a drawing by John Baptiste Greuze. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> plate which he engraved; and is a proof that neither his eyes nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> were impaired by age. It likewise shows the use he made both of aquafortis and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVER\">graver</a>. Each volume, besides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> to the king, contains an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> on the progress of engraving, and critical remarks on the pictures from which his engravings are taken. These volumes were ready to be given to the public, when Sir Robert's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> delayed this magnificent publication; a publication which does so much honour to the artist, and to the country which gave him birth. He died at London 5th July 1792.\n\nThe following is an authentic catalogue of his works.\n\nPlate 1.

Properly speaking, indeed, the upper stratum of the earth all round, is composed of the pure vegetable mould, though in many places it is mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities of other strata, as clay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, gravel, &c.; and hence proceed the differences of soils so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known to those who practice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>.\n\nIt has been supposed, by some naturalists, that the different strata of which the earth is composed were originally formed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, and have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a manner immutable ever since: but this cannot possibly have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, since we find that many of the strata are strangely intermixed with each other; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of animals both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> and terrestrial are frequently found at great depths in the earth; beds of oyster-shells are found of immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> in several countries; and concerning these and other shell-fish, it is remarkable, that they are generally found much farther from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> than the bones or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> either of marine or terrestrial animals.

Every cotton mill appears an academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> science; and mechanical invention is spreading from these fountains over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> is mortified to see this ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> so cramped by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of principle, and many of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and brilliant thoughts obscured and clogged with needless and even hurtful additions, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of machinery which checks improvement even by its appearance of ingenuity. There is nothing in which this want of scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, this ignorance of principle, is so frequently observed as in the injudicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> and other mechanical structures; proportions and forms of parts in which the strength and position are not regulated by the strains to which they are exposed, and where repeated failures have been the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a>.\n\nIt cannot be otherwise. We have no means of instruction, except two very short and abstracted treatises of the late Mr Emerson <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the strength of materials. We do not recollect a performance in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> from which our artists can get <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. Treatises written expressly on different branches of mechanical arts are totally silent on this, which is the basis and only principle of their performances. Who would imagine that Price's British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTER\">Carpenter</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the first reputation in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and of which the sole aim is to teach the carpenter to erect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and durable structures, does not contain one proposition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> by which one form of a thing can be shown to be stronger or weaker than another? We doubt very much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> one carpenter in a hundred can give a reason to convince his own mind that a joist is stronger when laid on its edge than when laid on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> side. We speak in this strong manner in hopes of exciting some man of science to publish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of instruction on this subject. The limits of our Work <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not admit of a detail; but we think it necessary to point out the leading principles, and to give the traces of that systematic connection by which all the knowledge already possessed of this subject may be brought.\nStrength of brought together and properly arranged. This we shall now attempt in as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> a manner as we are able.\n\nThe strength of materials arises immediately or ultimately from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the parts of bodies. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of tangible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> has as yet been very partial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, and by no means enables us to apply mathematical calculations with precision and success. The various modifications of cohesion, in its different appearances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> softness, pliability, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCTILITY\">ductility</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, have a mighty influence on the strength of bodies, but are hardly susceptible of measurement. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> also, whether uniform like glass and ductile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, crystallized or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> like other metals and freestone, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, is a circumstance no less important; yet even here, although we derive some advantage from remarking to which of these forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGGREGATION\">aggregation</a> a substance belongs, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> is but small. All we can do in this want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> principles is to make experiments on every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of bodies. Accordingly philosophers have endeavoured to instruct the public in this particular. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> at its very first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> made many experiments at their meetings, as may be seen in the first registers of the Society*. Several individuals have added their experiments. The most numerous collection in detail is by Mulschenbroek, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>. Part of it was published by himself in his Essais de Physique, in two vols. 4to; but the full collection is to be found in his System of Natural Philosophy, published after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> by Lulofs, in three vols 4to. This was translated from the Low Dutch into French by Sigaud de la Fond, and published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1762, and is a prodigious collection of physical knowledge of all kinds, and may almost suffice for a library of natural philosophy. But this collection of experiments on the cohesion of bodies is not of that value which one expects. We presume that they were carefully made and faithfully narrated; but they were made on such small specimens, that the unavoidable natural inequalities of growth or texture produced irregularities in the results which bore too great a proportion to the whole quantities observed. We may make the same remark on the experiments of Couplet, Pitot, De la Hire, Du Hamel, and others of the French academy. In short, if we except the experiments of Buffon on the strength of timber, made at the public expense on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, there is nothing to be met with from which we can obtain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> which may be employed with confidence; and there is nothing in the English language except a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> by Emeron, which is merely a set of affirmations, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> of circumstances, to enable us to judge of the validity of its conclusions: but the character of Mr Emeron, as a man of knowledge and of integrity, gives even to these assertions a considerable value.\n\nBut to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of any experiments, there must be employed some general principle by which we can generalize their results. They will otherwise be only narratives of detached facts. We must have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of that intermediate, by the intervention of which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> force applied to one part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, or pillar, occasions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> on a distant part. This can be nothing but the cohesion between the parts. It is this connecting force which is brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, or, as we more shortly express it, excited. This action is modified in every part by the laws of mechanics. It is this action which is what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the strength of that part, and its effect is the strain on the adjoining parts; and thus it is the same force, differently viewed, that constitutes both the strain and the strength. When we consider it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a resistance to fracture, we call it strength.\n\nWe call everything a force which we observe to be ever accompanied by a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; or, more strictly speaking, we infer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> and agency of a force wherever we observe the state of things in respect of motion different from what we know to be the result of the action of all the forces which we know to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the body. Thus when we observe a rope prevent a body from falling, we infer a moving force inherent in the rope with as much confidence as when we observe it drag the body along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. The immediate action of this force is undoubtedly exerted between the immediately adjoining parts of the rope. The immediate effect is the keeping the particles of the rope together. They ought to separate by any external force <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the ends of the rope contrarywise; and we ascribe their not doing so to a mechanical force really opposing this external force. When desired to give it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, we name it from what we conceive to be its effect, and therefore its characteristic, and we call it cohesion. This is merely a name for the fact; but it is the same thing in all our denominations. We know nothing of the cause but in the effects; and our name for the cause is in fact the name of the effect, which is cohesion. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> nothing else by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>. What do we mean when we say that Newton understood thoroughly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of gravitation, of the force of gravitation; or that Franklin understood the nature of the electric force? Nothing but this: Newton considered with patient sagacity the general facts of gravitation, and has described and classified them with the utmost precision. In like manner, we shall understand the nature of cohesion when we have discovered with equal generality the laws of cohesion, or general facts which are observed in the appearances, and when we have described and classified them with equal accuracy.\n\nLet us therefore attend to the more simple and obvious phenomena of cohesion, and mark with care every circumstance of resemblance by which they may be clasped. Let us receive these as the laws of cohesion, characteristic of its supposed cause, the force of cohesion. We cannot pretend to enter on this vast research. The modifications are innumerable; and it would require the penetration of more than Newton to detect the circumstance of similarity amidst millions of discriminating circumstances. Yet this is the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of discovering which are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> facts characteristic of the force, and which are the modifications. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> is immense, but it is by no means desperate; and we entertain great hopes that it will ere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> be successfully prosecuted: but, in our particular predicament, we must content ourselves with selecting such general laws as seem to give us the most immediate information of the circumstances that must be attended to by the mechanician in his constructions, that he may unite strength with simplicity, economy, and energy.\n\nThen, it is a matter of fact that all bodies are in a certain\nStrength of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>; that is, when their form or bulk is changed by certain moderate compressions or distractions, it requires the continuance of the changing force to continue the body in this new state; and when the force is removed, the body recovers its original form.\n\nWe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> this affection to certain moderate changes: For instance, take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> wire of one-fifteenth of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> and ten feet long; fix one end firmly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a>, and let the wire hang <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a> to the lower end an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of a watch; on some stand immediately below let there be a circle divided into degrees, with its centre corresponding to the lower point of the wire: now turn this index twice round, and thus twist the wire. When the index is let go, it will turn backwards again, by the wire's untwisting itself, and make almost four revolutions before it stops; after which it twists and untwists many times, the index going backwards and forwards round the circle, diminishing however its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of twist each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> it settles precisely in its original position. This may be repeated for ever. Now, in this motion, every part of the wire partsake equally of the twist. The particles are stretched, require force to keep them in their state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, and recover completely their relative positions. These are all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of what the mechanician calls perfect elasticity. This is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> quite familiar in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; as in glass, tempered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, &c., but was thought incompetent to lead, which is generally considered as having little or no elasticity. But we make the affection in the most general terms, with the limitation to moderate derangement of form. We have made the same experiment on a thread of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>-clay, made by forcing soft clay through the small hole of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRINGE\">syringe</a> by means of a screw; and we found it more elastic than the lead wire: for a thread of one-twentieth of an inch diameter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> feet long allowed the index to make two turns, and yet completely recovered its first position.\n\n2. But if we turn the index of the lead wire four times round, and let it go again, it untwists again in the same manner, but it makes little more than four turns back again; and after many oscillations it finally stops in a position almost two revolutions removed from its original position. It has now acquired a new arrangement of parts, and this new arrangement is permanent like the former; and, what is of particular moment, it is perfectly elastic. This change is familiarly known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of a set. The wire is said to have taken a set. When we attend minutely to the procedure of nature in this phenomenon, we find that the particles have as it were slid on each other, still cohering, and have taken a new position, in which their connecting forces are in equilibrium: and in this change of relative situation, it appears that the connecting forces which maintained the particles in their first situation were not in equilibrium in some position intermediate between that of the first and that of the last form. The force required for changing this first form augmented with the change, but only to a certain degree; and during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> the connecting forces always tended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of this first form. But after the change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> position has passed a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> has been partly destroyed, and the particles have been brought into new situations; such, that the forces which now connect each with its neighbour tend, not to the recovery of the first arrangement, but to push them farther from it, into a new situation, to which they now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a>, and require force to prevent them from acquiring. The wire is now in fact again perfectly elastic; that is, the forces which now connect the particles with their neighbours augment to a certain degree as the derangement from this new position augments. This is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. It is narrating facts, on which a theory is to be founded. What we have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now saying is evidently a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of that sensible form of tangible matter which we call ductility. It has every gradation of variety, from the softness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> to the firmness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. All these bodies have some elasticity; but we say they are not perfectly elastic, because they do not completely recover their original form when it has been greatly damaged. The whole gradation may be most distinctly observed in a piece of glass or hard sealing wax. In the ordinary form glass is perhaps the most completely elastic body that we know, and may be bent till just ready to snap, and yet completely recovers its first form, and takes no set whatever; but when heated to such a degree as just to be visible in the dark, it loses its brittleness, and becomes so tough that it cannot be broken by any blow; but it is no longer elastic, takes any set, and keeps it. When more heated, it becomes as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTIC\">plastic</a> as clay; but in this state is remarkably distinguished from clay by a quality which we may call viscosity, which is something like elasticity, of which clay and other bodies purely plastic exhibit no appearance. This is the joint operation of strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> and softness. When a rod of perfectly soft glass is suddenly stretched a little, it does not at once take the shape which it acquires after some little time. It is owing to this, that in taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, if we take off the seal while the wax is yet very hot, the sharpness of the impression is destroyed immediately. Each part drawing its neighbour, and each part yielding, the prominent parts are pulled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and blunted, and the sharp hollows are pulled upwards and also blunted. The seal must be kept on till all has become not only stiff but hard.\n\nThis viscosity is to be observed in all plastic bodies, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a>. It is not observed in clay, being in all homogeneous it is not homogeneous, but consists of hard particles of argillaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> sticking together by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. Something like it might be made of finely powdered glass and a clammy fluid such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>. Viscosity has all degrees of softness till it degenerates to ropy fluidity like that of olive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. Perhaps something of it may be found even in the most perfect fluid that we are acquainted with, as we observed in the experiments for ascertaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity.\n\nThere is in a late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions a narrative of experiments, by which it appears that the thread of the spider is an exception to our first general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and that it is perfectly ductile. It is there asserted, that a long thread of gossamer, furnished with an index, takes any position whatever; and that though the index be turned round any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of times (even many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>), it has no tendency to recover its first form. The thread takes completely any set whatever. We have not had an opportunity of repeating this experiment, but we have distinctly observed a phenomenon totally inconsistent with it. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of gossamer about an inch long be held by the end horizontally, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> downward.\nStrength of downward in a curve like a slender slip of whalebone or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. If totally devoid of elasticity, and perfectly indifferent to any fet, it would hang down perpendicularly without any curvature.\n\nWhen ductility and elasticity are combined in different proportions, an immense variety of sensible modes of aggregation may be produced. Some degree of both are probably to be observed in all bodies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; that is, which consist of particles made up of many different kinds of atoms. Such a constitution of a body must afford many situations permanent, but easily deranged.\n\nIn all these changes of disposition which take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> among the particles of a ductile body, the particles are at such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> that they still cohere. The body may be stretched a little; and on removing the extending force, the body shrinks into its first form. It also resists moderate compressions; and when the compressing force is removed, the body swells out again. Now the corporeal fact here is, that the particles are acted on by attractions and repulsions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other when no external force is acting on the body, and which augment as the particles are made, by any external cause, to recede from this situation of mutual inactivity; for since force is requisite to produce either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> or the compression, and to maintain it, we are obliged, by the constitution of our minds, to infer that it is opposed by a force accompanying or inherent in every particle of dilatable or compressible matter; and as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of employing force to produce a change indicates the agency of these corporeal forces, and marks their kind, according as the tendencies of the particles appear to be toward each other in dilatation, or from each other in compression; so it also measures the degrees of their intensity. Should it require three times the force to produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> compression, we must reckon the mutual repulsions triple when the compression is doubled; and so in other instances. We see from all this that the phenomena of cohesion indicate some relation between the centres of the particles. To discover this relation is the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> in corporeal mechanism, as it was in the Newtonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the force of gravitation. Could we discover this law of action between the corporeal with the same certainty and definiteness, we might with equal confidence say what will be the result of any position which we give to the particles of bodies; but this is beyond our hopes. The law of gravitation is so simple, that the discovery or detection of it amid the variety of celestial phenomena required but one step; and in its own nature its possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> still do not greatly exceed the powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> research. One is almost disposed to say that the Supreme Being has exhibited it to our reasoning powers as sufficient to employ with success our utmost efforts, but not so abstruse as to discourage us from the noble attempt. It seems to be otherwise with respect to cohesion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> informs us, that if it deviates sensibly from the law of gravitation, the simplest combinations will make the joint action of several particles an almost impenetrable mystery. We must therefore content ourselves, for a long time to come, with a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the simplest cases that we can propose, and with the discovery of secondary laws of action, in which many particles combine their influence. In pursuance of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, we observe,\n\n3. That whatever is the situation of the particles of a body with respect to each other, when in a quiescent state, they are kept in these situations by the balance of opposite forces. This cannot be refused, nor can we particles form to ourselves any other notion of the state of the kept in particles of a body. Whether we suppose the ultimate their places to be of certain magnitudes and shapes, touch, by a balance of each other in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of cohesion; or whether forces, we (with Bolzovich) consider them as at a distance from each other, and acting on each other by attractions and repulsions\u2014we must acknowledge, in the first place, that the centres of the particles (by whose mutual distances we must estimate the distance of the particles) may and do vary their distances from each other. What else can we say when we observe a body increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, in breadth, and in thickness, by heating it, or when we see it diminish in all these dimensions by an external compression? A particle, therefore, situated in the midst of many others, and remaining in that situation, must be conceived as maintained in it by the mutual balancing of all the forces which connect it with its neighbours. It is like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> kept in its place by the opposite action of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>. This illustration meriteth of a more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>. Suppose a number of this proposal balls ranged on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of equilateral triangles, and that each ball is connected with the six which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> around it by means of an elastic wire curled like a cork-screw; suppose such another stratum of balls above this, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to it, and so placed that each ball of the upper stratum is perpendicularly over the centre of the equilateral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> below, and let these be connected with the balls of the under stratum by similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> wires. Let there be a third and a fourth, and any number of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, all connected in the same manner. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that this may extend to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and fill any space.\u2014Now let this assemblage of balls be firmly contemplated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and be supposed to think continually in all its dimensions, till the balls, and their distances from each other, and the connecting wires, all vanish from the sight as discrete individual objects. All this is very conceivable. It will now appear like a solid body, having length, breadth, and thickness; it may be compressed, and will again resume its dimensions; it may be stretched, and will again shrink; it will move, away when struck; in short, it will not differ in its sensible appearance from a solid elastic body. Now when this body is in a state of compression, for instance, it is evident that any one of the balls is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the mutual balancing of the actions of all the spiral wires which connect it with those around it. It will greatly conduce to the full understanding of all that follows to recur to this illustration. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> or resemblance between the effects of this constitution of things and the effects of the corporeal forces is very great; and wherever it obtains, we may safely draw conclusions from what we know would be the condition of a body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> tangible matter. We shall just give one instructive example, and then have done with this plausible hypothetical body. We can suppose it of a long shape, resting on one point; we can suppose two weights A, B, suspended at the extremities, and the whole in equilibrium. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> express this state of things by saying that A and B are in equilibrium. This is very inaccurate. A is in fact in equilibrium with the united actions of all the springs which connect the ball to which it is applied with\nStrength of with the adjoining balls. These springs are brought into action, and each is in equilibrium with the joint action of all the rest. Thus through the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the hypothetical body, the springs are brought into action in a way and in a degree which mathematics can easily investigate. We need not do this: it is enough for our purpose that our imagination readily discovers that some springs are stretched, others are compressed, and that a pressure is excited on the middle point of support; and the support exerts a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> which precisely balances it; and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> is, in like manner, in immediate equilibrium with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> of the actions of all the springs which connect the last ball with its neighbours.\n\nNow take the analogical or resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> piece of solid matter, resting on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FULCRUM\">fulcrum</a>, and loaded with two weights in equilibrium. For the actions of the connecting springs substitute the corpuscular forces, and the result will resemble that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>.\n\nNow as there is something that is at least analogous to a change of distance of the particles, and a concomitant change of the intensity of the connecting forces, we may express this in the same way that we are accustomed to do in similar cases. Let A and B (fig. 1.) represent the centres of two particles of a coherent elastic body in their quiescent inactive state, and let us consider only the mechanical condition of B. The body may be stretched. In this case the distance A.B of the particles may become A.C. In this state there is something which makes it necessary to employ a force to keep the particles at this distance. C has a tendency towards A, or we may say that A attracts C. We may represent the magnitude of this tendency of C towards A, or this attraction of A, by a line Cc perpendicular to A.C. Again, the body may be compressed, and the distance A.B may become A.D. Something obliges us to employ force to continue this compression; and D tends from A, or A appears to repel D. The intensity of this tendency or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a> may be represented by another perpendicular D.d; and, to represent the different directions of these tendencies, or the different nature of these actions, we may set D.d on the opposite side of A.B. It is in this manner that the Abb\u00e9 Bofcovitch has represented the actions of corpuscular forces in his celebrated Theory of Natural Philosophy. Newton had said, that, as the great movements of the solar system were regulated by forces operating at a distance, and varying with the distance, so he strongly suspected (valde supposio) that all the phenomena of cohesion, with all its modifications in the different sensible forms of aggregation, and in the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> and physiology, resulted from the similar agency of forces varying with the distance of the particles. The learned Jesuit pursued this thought; and has shown, that if we suppose an ultimate atom of matter endowed with powers of attraction and repulsion, varying, both in kind and degree, with the distance, and if this force be the same in every atom, it may be regulated by such a relation to the distance from the neighbouring atom, that a collection of such may have all the sensible appearance of bodies in their different forms of solids, liquids, and vapours, elastic or unelastic, and endowed with all the properties which we perceive, by whose immediate operation the phenomena of motion by impulse, and all the phenomena of chemistry, and of animal and vegetable economy, may be produced. He shows, that notwithstanding a perfect sameness, and even a great simplicity in this atomic constitution, there will result from this union all that unspeakable variety of form and property which diversify and embellish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of nature. We shall take another opportunity of giving such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this celebrated work as it deserves. We mention it only, by the bye, as far as a general notion of it will be of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> on the present occasion. For this purpose, we just observe that Bofcovitch conceives a particle of any individual species of matter to consist of an unknown number of particles of simpler constitution; each of which particles, in their turn, is compounded of particles still more simply constituted, and so on through an unknown number of orders, till we arrive at the simplest possible constitution of a particle of tangible matter, susceptible of length, breadth, and thickness, and necessarily consisting of four atoms of matter. And he shows that the more complex we suppose the constitution of a particle, the more must the sensible qualities of the aggregate resemble the observed qualities of tangible bodies. In particular, he shows how a particle may be so constituted, that although it act on one other particle of the same kind through a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, the interposition of a third particle of the same kind may render it totally, or almost totally, inactive; and therefore an affiniment of such particles would form such a fluid as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. All these curious inferences are made with uncontroversible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>; and the greatest encouragement is thus given to the mathematical philosopher to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, that by cautious and patient proceeding in this way, we may gradually approach to a knowledge of the laws of cohesion, that will not then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> even with the Principia of Newton. No step can be made in this investigation, but by observing with care, and generalizing with judgement, the phenomena, which are abundantly numerous, and much more at our command than those of the great and sensible motions of bodies. Following this plan, we observe,\n\n4. It is matter of fact, that every body has some degree of compressibility and dilatability; and when the common changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> are so moderate that the body is completely recover its original dimensions on the cessation of the changing force, the extensions or compressions are sensibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the extending or compressing forces; and therefore the connecting forces are proportional to the distances of the particles from their quiescent, neutral, or inactive position. This seems to have been first viewed as a law of nature by the penetrating eye of Dr Robert Hooke, one of the most eminent natural philosophers of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. He published a cipher, which he said contained the theory of springiness, and of Dr Hooke, the motions of bodies by the action of springs. It was this, ceiinossstuu.\u2014When explained in his dissertation, published some years after, it was ut tenfso fiovis. This is precisely the proposition just now asserted as a general fact, a law of nature. This dissertation is full of curious observations of facts in support of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a>. In his application to the motion of bodies he gives his noble discovery of the balance-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of a watch, which is founded on this law. The spring, as it is more and more coiled up, or unwound, by the motion of the balance, acts on it with a force proportional to the distance of the balance from its quiescent position. The balance therefore is acted on by an accelerating force, which varies in the same manner as the force of gravity.\nStrength of gravity acting on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> swinging in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYCLOID\">cycloid</a>. Its vibrations therefore must be performed in equal time, whether they are wide or narrow. In the same dissertation Hooke mentions all the facts which John Bernoulli afterwards adduced in support of Leibnitz's whimsical doctrine of the force of bodies in motion, or the doctrine of the vis viva; a doctrine which Hooke might justly have claimed as his own, had he not seen its futility.\n\nExperiments made since the time of Hooke show that this law is strictly true in the extent to which we have limited it, viz. in all the changes of form which will be completely undone by the elasticity of the body. It is nearly true to a much greater extent. James Bernoulli, in his dissertation on the elastic curve, relates some experiments of his own, which seem to deviate considerably from it; but on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> examination they do not. The finest experiments are those of Coulomb, published in some late volumes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the Academy of Paris. He suspended balls by wires, and observed their motions of oscillation, which he found accurately corresponding with this law.\n\nThis we shall find to be a very important fact in the doctrine of the strength of bodies, and we desire the reader to make it familiar to his mind. If we apply to this our manner of expressing these forces by perpendicular ordinates Cc, Dd (fig. 1), we must take other situations E, F, of the particle B, and draw Ee, Ff; and we must have Da : Fa = BD : BF, or Ce : Ee = BC : BE. In such a proposition FaBce must be a straight line. But we shall have abundant evidence by and bye that this cannot be strictly true, and that the line Bce which limits the ordinates expressing the attractive forces becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> towards the line ABE, and that the part Bdf is convex towards it. All that can be safely concluded from the experiments hitherto made is, that to a certain extent the forces, both attractive and repulsive, are sensibly proportional to the dilatations and compressions.\n\nFor,\n\n5. It is universally observed, that when the dilatations have proceeded a certain length, a less addition of force is sufficient to increase the dilatation in the same degree. This is always observed when the body has been so far stretched that it takes a set, and does not completely recover its form. The like may be generally observed in compressions. Most persons will recollect, that in violently stretching an elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, it becomes suddenly weaker, or more easily stretched. But these phenomena do not positively prove a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the corpuscular force acting on one particle: it more probably arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of some particles, whose action contributed to the whole or sensible effect. And in compressions we may suppose something of the same kind; for when we compress a body in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, it commonly bulges out in another; and in cases of very violent action some particles may be disunited, whose transverse action had formerly balanced part of the compressing force. For the reader will see on reflection, that since the compression in one direction causes the body to bulge out in the transverse direction; and since this bulging out is in opposition to the transverse forces of attraction, it must employ some part of the compressing force. And the common appearances are in perfect uniformity with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of things. When we press a bit of dryish clay, it swells out and cracks transversely. When a pillar of wood is overloaded, it swells out, and small crevices appear in the direction of the fibres. After this it will not bear half of the load. This the carpenters call crippling; and a knowledge of the circumstances which modify it is of great importance, and enables us to understand some very paradoxical appearances, as will be shown by and bye.\n\nThis partial diffusing of particles formerly cohering is, we imagine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> reason why the totality of the forces which really oppose an external strain does not increase in the proportion of the extensions and compressions. But sufficient evidence will also be given that the forces which would connect one particle with one other particle do not augment in the accurate proportion of the change of distance; that in extensions they increase more slowly, and in compressions more rapidly.\n\nBut there is another cause of this deviation perhaps equally effectual with the former. Most bodies manifest another degree of ductility. Now what is this? The fact cause of is, that the parts have taken a new arrangement, in deviation, which they again cohere. Therefore, in the passage to this new arrangement, the sensible forces, which are the joint result of many corpuscular forces, begin to respect this new arrangement instead of the former. This must change the simple law of corpuscular force, characteristic of the particular species of matter under examination. It does not require much reflection to convince us that the possible arrangements which the particles of a body may acquire, without appearing to change their nature, must be more numerous according as the particles are of a more complex constitution; and it is reasonable to suppose that the constitution even of the most simple kind of matter that we are acquainted with is exceedingly complex. Our microscopes show us animals so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, that a heap of them must appear to the naked eye an uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> with a grain finer than that of the finest marble or razor hone; and yet each of these has not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, muscular fibres, blood-vessels, fibres, and a blood constituting, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, of globules organized and complex like our own. The imagination is here lost in wonder; and nothing is left us but to adore inconceivable art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and to exult in the thought that we are the only spectators of this beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> who can derive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> from the view. What is trodden under foot with indifference, even by the half-reasoning elephant, may be made by us the source of the purest and most unmixed pleasure. But let us proceed to observe,\n\n6. That the forces which connect the particles of tangible bodies change by a change of distance, not only in degree, but also in kind. The particle B (fig. 1) is attracted by A when in the situation C or E. It is repelled by it when at D or F. It is not affected by it when in the situation B. The reader is requested care, change by fully to remark, that this is not an inference founded on a change of distances, the authority of our mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The figure is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> (to assist the imagination) of facts in nature. It requires no force to keep the particles of a body in their quiescent situations: but if they are separated by stretching the body, they endeavour (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> the figurative expression) to come together again. If they are brought nearer by compression, they endeavour to recede. This endeavour is manifested by the necessity of employing force to maintain the extension or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a>; and we represent this by the different position.\nStrength of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>. But this is not all: the particle B, which is repelled by A when in the situation F or D, is neutral when at B, and is attracted when at C or E, may be placed at such a distance AG from A greater than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> that it shall again be repelled, or at such a distance AH that it shall again be attracted; and these alterations may be repeated again and again. This is curious and important, and requires something more than a bare affe- fation for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>.\n\nIn the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> we mentioned the most curious and valuable observations of Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, by which it appears that light is thus alternately attracted and repelled by bodies. The rings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> which appear between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> glasses of long telescopes showed, that in the small interval of \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch, there are at least an hundred such changes observable, and that it is highly probable that these alterations extend to a much greater distance. At one of these distances the light actually converges towards the solid matter of the glass, which we express shortly, by saying that it is attracted by it; and that at the next distance it declines from the glass, or is repelled by it. The same thing is more simply inferred from the phenomena of light falling by the edges of knives and other opaque bodies. We refer the reader to the experiments themselves, the detail being too long for this place; and we request him to consider them minutely and attentively, and to form distinct notions of the inferences drawn from them. And we desire it to be remarked, that although Sir Isaac, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, always considers light as a set of corpuscles moving in free space, and obeying the actions of external forces like any other matter, the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> in which we are just now interested does not at all depend on this notion of the nature of light. Should we, with Descartes or Huygens, suppose light to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> of an elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a>, the conclusion will be the same. The undulations at certain distances are disturbed by forces directed towards the body, and at a greater distance, the disturbing forces tend from the body.\n\nBut the same alternations of attraction and repulsion may be observed between the particles of common matter. If we take a piece of very flat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-polished glass, such as is made for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> glasses of a good Hadley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, and if we wrap round it a fibre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> as it comes from the cocoon, taking care that the fibre nowhere crosses another, and then press this pretty hard on such another piece of glass, it will lift it up and keep it suspended. The particles therefore of the one do most certainly attract those of the other, and this at a distance equal to the thickness of the silk fibre. This is nearly the limit; and it sometimes requires a considerable pressure to produce the effect. The pressure is effectual only by compressing the silk fibre, and thus diminishing the distance between the glass plates. This adhesion cannot be attributed to the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, because there is nothing to hinder the air from infusing itself between the plates, since they are separated by the silk. Besides, the experiment succeeds equally well under the receiver of an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>. This most valuable experiment was first made by Huygens, who reported it to the Royal Society. It is narrated in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 86.\n\nHere then is an attraction acting, like gravity, at a distance. But take away the silk fibre, and try to make the glasses touch each other, and we shall find a very great force necessary. By Newton's experiments it appears, that unless the prismatic colours begin to appear between the glasses, they are at least \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch asunder or more. Now we know that a very considerable force is necessary for producing these colours, and that the more we press the glasses together the more rings of colours appear. It also appears from Newton's measures, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of distance between the glasses where each of these colours appear is about the \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch. We know farther, that when we have produced the last appearance of a grey or pearly colour, and then augment the pressure, making it about a thousand pounds on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> inch, all colours vanish, and the two pieces of glass seem to make one transparent undistinguishable mass. They appear now to have no air between them, or to be in mathematical contact. But another fact shows this conclusion to be premature. The same circles of colours appear in the top of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> bubble; and as it grows thinner at top, there appears an unreflecting spot in the middle. We have the greatest probability therefore that the perfect transparency in the middle of the two glasses does not arise from their being in contact, but because the thickness of air between them is too small in that place for the reflection of light. Nay, Newton expressly found no reflection where the thickness was \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) or more of the \\( \\frac{1}{89} \\) part of an inch.\n\nAll this while the glasses are strongly repelling each other, for great pressure is necessary for continuing the appearance of these colours, and they vanish in succession as the pressure is diminished. This vanishing of the colours is a proof that the glasses are moving off from each other, or repelling each other. But we can put an end to this repulsion by very strong pressure, and at the same time sliding the glasses on each other. We do not pretend to account for this effect of the sliding motion; but the fact is, that by so doing, the glasses will cohere with very great force, so that we shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> them by any attempt to pull them asunder. It commonly happens (at least it did so with us), that in this sliding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two smooth flat plates of glass they scratch and mutually destroy each other's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>. It is also worth remarking, that different kinds of glasses exhibit different properties in this respect. Flint glasses will attract even though a silk fibre lies double between them, and they much more readily cohere by this sliding pressure.\n\nHere then are two distances at which the plates of glass attract each other; namely, when the silk fibre is interposed, and when they are forced together with this sliding motion. And in any intermediate situation they repel each other. We see the same thing in other solid bodies. Two pieces of lead made perfectly clean, may be made to cohere by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> them together in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> manner. It is in this way that pretty ornaments of silver are united to iron. The piece is scraped clean, and a small bit of silver like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> scale is laid on. The die which is to strike it into a flower or other ornament is then put on it, and we give it a smart blow, which forces the metals into contact as firm as if they were soldered together. It sometimes happens that the die adheres to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> so that they cannot be separated; and it is found that this frequently happens, when the engraving is such, that the raised figure is not complete-\nStrength ofly surrounded with a smooth flat ground. The probable cause of this is curious. When the coin has a flat surface all around, this is produced by the most prominent part of the die. This applies to the metal, and completely confines the air which filled the hollow of the die. As the pressure goes on, the metal is squeezed up into the hollow of the die; but there is still air compressed between them, which cannot escape by any passage. It is therefore prodigiously condensed, and exerts an elasticity proportioned to the condensation. This serves to separate the die from the metal when the stroke is over. The hollow part of the die has not touched the metal all the while, and we may say that the impression was made by air. If this air escape by any engraving reaching through the border, they cohere inseparably.\n\nWe have admitted that the glass plates are in contact when they cohere thus firmly. But we are not certain of this: for if we take these cohering glasses, and touch them with water, it quickly infuses itself between them. Yet they still cohere, but can now be pretty easily separated.\n\nIt is owing to this repulsion, exerted through its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, that certain powders swim on the surface of water, and are wetted with great difficulty. Certain insects can run about on the surface of water. They have bristly feet, which occupy a considerable surface; and if their steps are viewed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> glass, the surface of the water is seen depressed all around, resembling the footsteps of a man walking on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-herds. This is owing to a repulsion between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> and the water. A common fly cannot walk in this manner on water. Its feet are wetted, because they attract the water instead of repelling it. A steel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, wiped very clean, will lie on the surface of water, making an impression as a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> would make on a feather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>; and its weight is less than that of the displaced water.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> drop lies on the leaves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> without touching them mathematically, as is plain from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> brilliancy of the reflection at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> surface; nay, it may be sometimes observed that the drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> lie on the surface of water, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> about on it like balls on a table. Yet all these substances can be wetted; that is, water can be applied to them at such distances that they attract it.\n\nWhat we said a little ago of water infusing itself between the glass plates without altogether destroying their cohesion, shows that this cohesion is not the same that obtains between the particles of one of the plates; that is, the two plates are not in the state of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> mass. It is highly probable, therefore, that between these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> there is an intermediate state of repulsion; nay, perhaps many such, alternated with attractive states.\n\nA piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> is elastic, for it rebounds and rings. Its particles, therefore, when compressed, resist; and when stretched, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> again. The particles are therefore in the state represented by B in figure 1, acted on by repulsive forces, if brought nearer; and by attractive forces, if drawn further asunder. Ice expands, like all other bodies, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. It absorbs a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fire; which, by combining its attractions and repulsions with those of the particles of ice, changes completely the law of action, without making any sensible change in the distance of the particles, and the ice becomes watery. In this new state the particles are again in limits strength of between attractive and repulsive forces; for water has been shown, by the experiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> and Zimmerman, to be elastic or compressible. It again expands by heat. It again absorbs a prodigious quantity of heat, and becomes elastic vapour; its particles repelling each other at all distances yet observed. The distance between the particles of one plate of glass and those of another which lies on it, and is carried by it, is a distance of repulsion; for the force which supports the upper piece is acting in opposition to its weight. This distance is less than that at which it would suspend it below it with a silk fibre interposed; for no prismatic colours appear between them when the silk fibre is interposed. But the distance at which glass attracts water is much less than this, for no colours appear when glass is wetted with water. This distance is less, and not greater, than the other; for when the glasses have water interposed between them instead of air, it is found, that when any particular colour appears, the thickness of the plate of water is to that of the plate of air which would produce the same colour nearly as 3 to 4. Now, if a piece of glass be wetted, and exhibit no colour, and another piece of glass be simply laid on it, no colour will appear; but if they are strongly pressed, the colours appear in the same manner as if the glasses had air between. Also, when glass is simply wetted, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> of water is allowed to evaporate, when it is thus reduced to a proper thinness, the colours show themselves in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>.\n\nThere are a few of many thousand facts, by which it is unquestionably proved that the particles of tangible matter are connected by forces acting at a distance, varying by forces with the distance, and alternately attractive and repelling at a repulsive. If we represent these forces as we have already done in fig. 1, by the ordinates C c, D d, E e, F f, &c., of a curve, it is evident that this curve must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> at all those distances where the forces change from attractive to repulsive, and the curve must have branches alternately above and below the axis.\n\nAll these alternations of attraction and repulsion take place at small and insensible distances. At all sensible distances the particles are influenced by the attraction of gravitation; and therefore this part of the curve must be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a> whose equation is \\( y = \\frac{a^3}{x^2} \\). What is the form of the curve corresponding to the smallest distance of the particles? that is, what is the mutual action between the particles just before their coming into absolute contact? Analogy should lead us to suppose it to be repulsion: for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> is the last simplest form of bodies with which we are acquainted.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">Fluids</a> are more compounded, containing fire as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> ingredient. We should conclude that this ultimate repulsion is insuperable, for the hardest bodies are the most elastic. We are fully entitled to say, that this repelling force exceeds all that we have ever yet applied to overcome it; nay, there are good reasons for saying that this ultimate repulsion, by which the particles are kept from mathematical contact, is really insuperable in its own nature, and that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to produce mathematical contact.\n\nWe shall just mention one of these, which we consider as unanswerable. Suppose two atoms, or ultimate particles of matter A and B. Let A be at rest, and B move.\nStrength of move up to it with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> 2; and let us suppose that it comes into mathematical contact, and impels it (according to the common acceptation of the word). Both move with the velocity 1. This is granted by all to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> result of the collision. Now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> of time in which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> happens is no part either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the solitary motion of A, nor of the joint motion of A and B: It is the separation or boundary between them. It is at once the end of the first, and the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, belonging equally to both. A was moving with the velocity 2. The distinguishing circumstance therefore of its mechanical state is, that it has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> (however incomprehensible) by which it would move for ever with the velocity 2, if nothing changed it. This it has during the whole of its solitary motion, and therefore in the last instant of this motion. In like manner, during the whole of the joint motion, and therefore in the first instant of this motion, the atom A has a determination by which it would move for ever with the velocity 1. In one and the same instant, therefore, the atom A has two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> determinations. Whatever notion we can form of this state, which we call velocity, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of condition, the same impossibility of conception or the same absurdity occurs. Nor can it be avoided in any other way than by saying, that this change of A's motion is brought about by insensible gradations; that is, that A and B influence each other precisely as they would do if a slender spring were interposed. The reader is desired to look at what we have said in the article Physics, \u00a7 82.\n\nThe two magnets there spoken of are good representatives of two atoms endowed with mutual powers of repulsion; and the communication of motion is accomplished in both cases in precisely the same manner.\n\nIf, therefore, we shall ever be so fortunate as to discover the law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of that force which connects one atom of matter with another atom, and which is therefore characteristic of matter, and the ultimate source of all its sensible qualities, the curve whose ordinates represent the kind and the intensity of this atomic force will be something like that sketched in fig. 2. The first branch a n B will have AK (perpendicular to the axis AH) for its asymptote, and the last branch l m o will be to all senses a hyperbola, having AO for its asymptote; and the ordinates l L, m M, &c. will be proportional to $\\frac{1}{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AL\">AL</a>^2}$, $\\frac{1}{AM^2}$, &c., expressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> gravitation of matter. It will have many branches B b C, D d E, F f G, &c., expressing attractions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> repulsive branches C c D, E e F, G g H, &c. All these will be contained within a distance AH, which does not exceed a very minute fraction of an inch.\n\nThe simplest particle which can be a constituent of a body having length, breadth, and thickness, must consist of four such atoms, all of which combine their influence on each atom of another such particle. It is evident that the curve which expresses the forces that connect two such particles must be totally different from this original curve, this hylarchic principle. Supposing the last known, our mathematical knowledge is quite able to discover the first; but when we proceed to compose a body of particles, each of which consists of four such particles, we may venture to say, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> force which connects them is almost beyond our reach, and that the discovery of the primary force from an accurate knowledge of the corporeal forces of this particular matter is absolutely out of our power.\n\nAll that we can learn is, the possibility, nay the certainty, of an innumerable variety of external sensible forms and qualities, by which different kinds of matter will be distinguished, arising from the number, the order of composition, and the arrangement of the subordinate particles of which a particle of this or that kind of matter is composed. All these varieties will take place at those small and insensible distances which are between A and H, and may produce all that variety which we observe in the tangible or mechanical forms of bodies, such as elasticity, ductility, hardness, softness, fluidity, vapour, and all those unseen motions or actions which we observe in fusion and congelation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> and condensation, solution and precipitation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, vegetable and animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a> and secretion, &c. &c. While all bodies must be, in a certain degree, elastic, all must gravitate, and all must be incompensable.\n\nThis general and satisfactory resemblance between the appearance of tangible matter and the legitimate consequence of this general hypothetical property of an atom of matter, affords a considerable probability that such is the origin of all the phenomena. We earnestly recommend to our readers a careful perusal of Bolcovich's celebrated treatise. A careful perusal is necessary for seeing its value; and nothing will be got by a hasty look at it. The reader will be particularly pleased with the facility and evidence with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author has deduced all the ordinary principles of mechanics, and with the explanation which he has given of fluidity, and his deduction from thence of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>. No part of the treatise is more valuable than the doctrine of the propagation of pressure through solid bodies. This, however, is but just touched on in the course of the investigation of the principles of mechanics. We shall borrow as much as will suffice for our present inquiry into the strength of materials; and we trust that our readers are not displeased with this general sketch of the doctrine (if it may be so called) of the cohesion of bodies. It is curious and important in itself, and is the foundation of all the knowledge we can acquire of the true nature of cohesion yet a new subject of study; but it is a very promising one, and we by no means despair of seeing the whole of chemistry brought by its means within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> of mechanical science. The great and distinguishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in chemistry is heat, or fire the cause of heat; and one of its most singular effects is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of bodies into elastic vapour. We have the clearest evidence that this is brought about by mechanical forces: for it can be opposed or prevented by external pressure, a very familiar mechanical force. We may perhaps find another mechanical force which will prevent fusion.\n\nHaving now made our readers familiar with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of action in which cohesion operates in giving strength to solid bodies, we proceed to consider the strains to which this strength is opposed.\n\nA piece of solid matter is exposed to four kinds of strains, pretty different in the manner of their operation, which 1. It may be torn asunder, as in the case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, stretchers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>-posts, tie-beams, &c.\n2. It may be crushed, as in the case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, posts, and truss beams.\n\n3. It may be broken across, as happens to a joist or lever of any kind.\n\n4. It may be wrenched or twisted, as in the case of the axle of a wheel, the nail of a press, &c.\n\nI. IT MAY BE PULLED ASUNDER.\n\nThis is the simplest of all strains, and the others are indeed modifications of it. To this the force of cohesion is directly opposed, with very little modification of its action by any particular circumstances.\n\nWhen a long cylindrical or prismatic body, such as a rod of wood or metal, or a rope, is drawn by one end, it must be resisted at the other, in order to bring its cohesion into action. When it is fastened at one end, we cannot conceive it any other way than as equally stretched in all its parts; for all our observations and experiments on natural bodies concur in showing us that the forces which connect their particles, in any way whatever, are equal and opposite. This is called the third law of motion; and we admit its universality, while we affirm that it is purely experimental (see Physics). Yet we have met with dissertations by persons of eminent knowledge, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> are maintained inconfutably with this. During the dispute about the communication of motion, some of the ablest writers have said, that a spring compressed or stretched at the two ends was gradually less and less compressed or stretched from the extremities towards the middle; but the same writers acknowledged the universal equality of action and reaction, which is quite incompatible with this state of the spring. No such inequality of compression or dilatation has ever been observed; and a little reflection will show it to be impossible, in consistency with the equality of action and reaction.\n\nSince all parts are thus equally stretched, it follows, that the strain in any transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> is the same, as also in every point of that section. If therefore the body be supposed of a homogeneous texture, the cohesion of the parts is equable; and since every part is equally stretched, the particles are drawn to equal distances from their quietest positions, and the forces which are thus excited, and now exerted in opposition to the straining force, are equal. This external force may be increased by degrees, which will gradually separate the parts of the body more and more from each other, and the connecting forces increase with this increase of distance, till at last the cohesion of some particles is overcome. This must be immediately followed by a rupture, because the remaining forces are now weaker than before.\n\nIt is the united force of cohesion, immediately before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the first particles, that we call the STRENGTH of the section. It may also be properly called its ABSOLUTE STRENGTH, being exerted in the simplest form, and not modified by any relation to other circumstances.\n\nIf the external force has not produced any permanent change on the body, and it therefore recovers its former dimensions when the force is withdrawn, it is plain that this strain may be repeated as often as we please, and the body which withstands it once will always withstand it. It is evident that this should be attended to in all constructions, and that in all our investigations on this subject this should be kept strictly in view. When we treat Materials, a piece of soft clay in this manner, and with this precaution, the force employed must be very small. If we exceed this, we produce a permanent change. The rod of clay is not indeed torn asunder; but it has become somewhat more slender; the number of particles in a cross section is now smaller; and therefore, although it will again, in this new form, suffer, or allow an endless repetition of a certain strain without any farther permanent change, this strain is smaller than the former.\n\nSomething of the same kind happens in all bodies which receive a set by the strain to which they are exposed. All ductile bodies are of this kind. But there are many bodies which are not ductile. Such bodies break completely whenever they are stretched beyond the limit of their perfect elasticity. Bodies of a fibrous structure exhibit very great varieties in their cohesion. In some the fibres have no lateral cohesion, as in the case of a rope. The only way in which all the fibres can be made to unite their strength is, to twist them together. This causes them to bind each other so fast, that any one of them will break before it can be drawn out of the bundle. In other fibrous bodies, such as timber, the fibres are held together by some cement or gluten. This is seldom as strong as the fibre. Accordingly timber is much easier pulled asunder in a direction transverse to the fibres. There is, however, every possible variety in this particular.\n\nIn stretching and breaking fibrous bodies, the visible extension is frequently very considerable. This is not solely the increasing of the distance of the particles of the cohering fibre: the greatest part chiefly arises from drawing the crooked fibre straight. In this, too, there is great diversity; and it is accompanied with important differences in their power of withstanding a strain. In some woods, such as fir, the fibres on which the strength most depends are very straight. Such woods are commonly very elastic, do not take a set, and break abruptly when overstrained: others, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a> and birch, have their resisting fibres very undulating and crooked, and stretch very sensibly by a strain. They are very liable to take a set, and they do not break so suddenly, but give warning by complaining, as the carpenters call it; that is, by giving visible signs of a derangement of texture. Hard bodies of an uniform glairy structure, or granulated like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, are elastic through the whole extent of their cohesion, and take no set, but break at once when overloaded.\n\nNotwithstanding the immense variety which nature exhibits in the structure and cohesion of bodies, there are certain general facts of which we may now avail ourselves with advantage. In particular,\n\nThe absolute cohesion is proportional to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the section. This must be the case where the texture is perfectly uniform, as we have reason to think it is in strength glials and the ductile metals. The cohesion of each proportionate particle being alike, the whole cohesion must be proportional to the number, that is, to the area of the section. The same must be admitted with respect to bodies of a granulated texture, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATION\">granulation</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and uniform. The same must be admitted of fibrous bodies, if we suppose their fibres equally strong, equally force.\nStrength of dense, and similarly disposed through the whole section; and this we must either suppose, or must state the diversity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the cohesion accordingly.\n\nWe may therefore assert, as a general proposition on this subject, that the absolute strength in any part of a body by which it resists being pulled asunder, or the force which must be employed to tear it asunder in that part, is proportional to the area of the section perpendicular to the extending force.\n\nTherefore all cylindrical or prismatic rods are equally strong in every part, and will break alike in any part; and bodies which have unequal sections will always break in the slenderest part. The length of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> has no effect on the strength; and the vulgar notion, that it is easier to break a very long rope than a short one, is a very great mistake. Also the absolute strengths of bodies which have similar sections are proportional to the squares of their diameters or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOLOGOUS\">homologous</a> sides of the section.\n\nThe weight of the body itself may be employed to strain it and to break it. It is evident, that a rope may be so long as to break by its own weight. When the rope is hanging perpendicularly, although it is equally strong in every part, it will break towards the upper end, because the strain on any part is the weight of all that is below it. Its relative strength in any part, or power of withstanding the strain which is actually laid on it, is inversely as the quantity below that part.\n\nWhen the rope is stretched horizontally, as in towing a ship, the strain arising from its weight often bears a very sensible proportion to its whole strength.\n\nLet AEB (fig. 3.) be any portion of such a rope, and AC, BC be tangents to the curve into which its gravity bends it. Complete the parallelogram ACBD. It is well known that the curve is a catenary, and that DC is perpendicular to the horizon; and that DC is to AC as the weight of the rope AEB to the strain at A.\n\nIn order that a suspended heavy body may be equally able in every part to carry its own weight, the section in that part must be proportional to the solid contents of all that is below it. Suppose it a conoidal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>, formed by the revolution of the curve Aae (fig. 4.) round the axis CE. We must have AC\u00b2 : ae\u00b2 = AEB fol. : aEb fol. This condition requires the logarithmic curve for Aae, of which Cc is the axis.\n\nThese are the chief general rules which can be safely deduced from our clearest notions of the cohesion of bodies. In order to make any practical use of them, it is proper to have some measures of the cohesion of such bodies as are commonly employed in our mechanics, and other structures where they are exposed to this kind of strain. These must be deduced solely from experiment. Therefore they must be considered as no more than general values, or as the averages of many particular trials. The irregularities are very great, because none of the substances are constant in their texture and firmness. Metals differ by a thousand circumstances unknown to us, according to their purity, to the heat with which they were melted, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> in which they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, and the treatment they have afterwards received, by forging, wire-drawing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a>, &c.\n\nIt is a very curious and inexplicable fact, that by forging a metal, or by frequently drawing it through a smooth hole in a steel plate, its cohesion is greatly increased. This operation undoubtedly deranges the natural situation of the particles. They are squeezed closer together in one direction; but it is not in the direction in which they resist the fracture. In this direction they are rather separated to a greater distance. The general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, however, is augmented in all of them except lead, which grows rather rarer by wire-drawing; but its cohesion may be more than tripled by this operation. Gold, silver, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, have their cohesion nearly tripled; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> and iron have it more than doubled. In this operation they also grow much harder. It is proper to heat them to redness after drawing a little. This is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNEALING\">annealing</a>. It softens the metal again, and renders it susceptible of another drawing without the risk of cracking in the operation.\n\nWe do not pretend to give any explanation of this remarkable and very important fact, which has something resembling it in woods and other fibrous bodies, as will be mentioned afterwards.\n\nThe varieties in the cohesion of stones and other minerals, and of vegetable and animal substances, are hardly susceptible of any description or classification.\n\nWe shall take for the measure of cohesion the number of pounds avoirdupois which are just sufficient to tear and asunder a rod or bundle of one inch square. From this it will be easy to compute the strength corresponding to metals of any other dimension.\n\n| Metals | lbs |\n|--------|-----|\n| Gold, cast | 20,000 |\n| Silver, cast | 24,000 |\n| Copper, cast | 43,000 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> | 19,500 |\n| Barbary | 22,000 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a> | 31,000 |\n| Anglesea | 34,000 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> | 37,000 |\n| Iron, cast | 42,000 |\n| Iron, bar | 59,000 |\n| Ordinary | 68,000 |\n| Stirian | 75,000 |\n| B.c.f Swedish and Russian | 84,000 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">Horse</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a> | 71,000 |\n| Steel, bar | 120,000 |\n| Razor temper | 150,000 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a> | 3,100 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANCA\">Banca</a> | 3,600 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">Block</a> | 3,800 |\n| English block | 5,200 |\n| Lead, cast | 6,500 |\n| Regulus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> | 860 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">Zinc</a> | 1,000 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISMUTH\">Bismuth</a> | 2,600 |\n\n(A) This was an experiment by Mulchenbroek, to examine the vulgar notion that iron forged from old horse nails was stronger than all others, and shows its fallacy.\nIt is very remarkable that almost all the mixtures of metals are more tenacious than the metals themselves. The change of tenacity depends much on the proportion of the ingredients, and the proportion which produces the most tenacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> is different in the different metals. We have selected the following from the experiments of Mulchenbroek. The proportion of ingredients here selected is that which produces the greatest strength.\n\nTwo parts of gold with one of silver - 28,000\nFive parts of gold with one of copper - 50,000\nFive parts of silver with one of copper - 48,300\nFour parts of silver with one of tin - 41,000\nSix parts of copper with one of tin - 41,000\nFive parts of Japan copper with one of Banca tin - 57,000\nSix parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHILI\">Chili</a> copper with one of Malacca tin - 60,000\nSix parts of Swedish copper with one of Malacca tin - 64,000\nBrass consists of copper and zinc in an unknown proportion; its strength is 51,000\nThree parts of block tin with one part of lead - 10,200\nEight parts of block tin with one part of zinc - 10,000\nFour parts of Malacca tin with one part of regulus of antimony - 12,000\nEight parts of lead with one of zinc - 4,500\nFour parts of tin with one of lead and one of zinc - 13,000\n\nThese numbers are of considerable use in the arts. The mixtures of copper and tin are particularly interesting in the fabric of great guns. We see that, by mixing copper whose greatest strength does not exceed 37,000, with tin which does not exceed 6000, we produce a metal whose tenacity is almost double, at the same time that it is harder and more easily wrought. It is, however, more fusible, which is a great inconvenience. We also see that a very small addition of zinc almost doubles the tenacity of tin, and increases the tenacity of lead five times; and a small addition of lead doubles the tenacity of tin. These are economical mixtures. This is a very valuable information to the plumbers for augmenting the strength of water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>.\n\nBy having recourse to these tables, the engineer can proportion the thickness of his pipes (of whatever metal) to the pressures to which they are exposed.\n\n2d. Woods.\n\nWe may premise to this part of the table the following general observations.\n\n1. The wood immediately surrounding the pith or heart of the tree is the weakest, and its inferiority is so much more remarkable as the tree is older. In this affection, however, we speak with some hesitation. Mulchenbroek's detail of experiments is decidedly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>. Mr Buffon, on the other hand, says, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has taught him that the heart of a found tree is the strongest; but he gives no instances. We are certain, from many observations of our own, on very large oaks and firs, that the heart is much weaker than the exterior parts.\n\n2. The wood next the bark, commonly called the strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or blea, is also weaker than the rest; and the wood gradually increases in strength as we recede from the centre to the blea.\n\n3. The wood is stronger in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> than at the springing of the branches or at the root; and the wood of the branches is weaker than that of the trunk.\n\n4. The wood of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> side of all trees which grow in our European climates is the weakest; and that of the south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> side is the strongest; and the difference is most remarkable in hedge-row trees, and such as growing singly. The heart of a tree is never in its centre, but always nearer to the north side, and the annual coats of wood are thinner on that side. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with this, it is a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of carpenters that timber is stronger whose annual plates are thicker. The trachea or air-vessels are weaker than the simple ligneous fibres. These air-vessels are the same in diameter and number of rows in trees of the same species, and they make the visible separation between the annual plates. Therefore when these are thicker, they contain a greater proportion of the simple ligneous fibres.\n\n5. All woods are more tenacious while green, and lose very considerably by drying after the trees are felled.\n\nThe only author who has put it in our power to judge of the propriety of his experiments is Mulchenbroek. He has described his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> minutely; and it seems unexceptionable. The woods were all formed into slips fit for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, and part of the slip was cut away to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of an inch square, and therefore \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of a square inch in section.

The numbers of this table corresponding to these two timbers may therefore be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of more than 50 trials made of each; and he says that all the others were made with the same care. We cannot therefore see any reason for not confiding in the results; yet they are considerably higher than those given by some other writers. Mr Pitot says, on the authority of his own experiments, and of those of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a>, that 60 pounds will just tear asunder a square line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> oak, and that it will bear 50 with safety. This gives \u00a3640 for the utmost strength of a square inch, which is much inferior to Mulchenbroek's valuation.\n\nWe may add to these,\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IVORY\">Ivory</a>\nThe reader will surely observe, that these numbers express something more than the utmost cohesion; for the weights are such as will very quickly, that is, in a minute or two, tear the rods asunder. It may be said in general, that two-thirds of these weights will sensibly impair the strength after a considerable while, and that one-half is the utmost that can remain suspended at them without risk for ever; and it is this last allotment that the engineer should reckon upon in his constructions. There is, however, considerable difference in this respect. Woods of a very straight fibre, such as fir, will be less impaired by any load which is not sufficient to break them immediately.\n\nAccording to Mr Emerson, the load which may be safely suspended to an inch square is as follows:\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">Material</a>                  | Load (lbs) |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| Iron                      | 76,400     |\n| Braids                    | 35,600     |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">Hemp</a> rope                 | 19,600     |\n| Ivory                     | 15,700     |\n| Oak, box, yew, plum-tree   | 7,850      |\n| Elm, ash, beech            | 6,070      |\n| Walnut, plum               | 5,360      |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> fir, holly, elder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, crab | 5,000 |\n| Cherry, hazel              | 4,760      |\n| Alder, ash, birch, willow  | 4,290      |\n| Lead                      | 430        |\n| Freestone                 | 914        |\n\nHe gives us a practical rule, that a cylinder whose diameter is d inches, loaded to one-fourth of its absolute strength, will carry as follows:\n\n| Material                  | Load (lbs) |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| Iron                      | 135        |\n| Good rope                 | 22         |\n| Oak                       | 14         |\n| Fir                       | 9          |\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> which the different woods hold in this list of Mr Emerson's is very different from what we find in Mutchtenbroek's. But precise measures must not be expected in this matter. It is wonderful that in a matter of such unquestionable importance the public has not enabled some persons of judgement to make proper trials. They are beyond the abilities of private persons.\n\nII. Bodies may be crushed.\n\nIt is of equal, perhaps greater, importance to know the strain which may be laid on solid bodies without danger of crushing them. Pillars and posts of all kinds are exposed to this strain in its simplest form; and there are cases where the strain is enormous, viz., where it arises from the oblique position of the parts; as in the flutes, braces, and trusses, which occur very frequently in our great works.\n\nIt is therefore most desirable to have some general knowledge of the principle which determines the strength of bodies in opposition to this kind of strain. But unfortunately we are much more at a loss in this than in the last case. The mechanism of nature is much more complicated in the present case. It must be in some curious way that compression can have any tendency to tear asunder the parts of a solid body, and it is very difficult to trace the steps.\n\nIf we suppose the particles insuperably hard and in contact, and disposed in lines which are in the direction of the external pressures, it does not appear how any pressure can disunite the particles; but this is a gratuitous supposition. There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> odds against this precise arrangement of the lines of particles; and the compressibility of all kinds of matter in some degree shows that the particles are in a situation equivalent to distance. This being the case, and the particles, with their intervals, or what is equivalent to intervals, being in situations that are oblique with respect to the pressures, it must follow, that by squeezing them together in one direction, they are made to bulge out or separate in other directions. This may proceed so far that some may be thus pushed laterally beyond their limits of cohesion. The moment that this happens the resistance to compression is diminished, and the body will now be crushed together. We may form some notion of this by supposing a number of spherules, like small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>, sticking together by means of a cement. Compressing this in some particular direction causes the spherules to act among each other like so many wedges, each tending to penetrate through between the three which lie below it: and this is the simplest, and perhaps the only distinct notion we can have of the matter. We have reason to think that the constitution of very homogeneous bodies, such as glass, is not very different from this. The particles are certainly arranged symmetrically in the angles of some regular solids. It is only such an arrangement that is consistent with transparency, and with the free passage of light in every direction.\n\nIf this be the constitution of bodies, it appears probable that the strength, or the resiliency which they are strength capable of making to an attempt to crush them to pieces, or power is proportional to the area of the section whose plane is of resistance perpendicular to the external force; for each particle being similarly and equally acted on and resisted, the whole force resiliency must be as their number; that is, as the extent of the section.\n\nAccordingly this principle is affirmed by the few writers who have considered this subject; but we confess that it appears to us very doubtful. Suppose a number of brittle or friable balls lying on a table uniformly arranged, but not cohering nor in contact, and that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> is laid over them and loaded with a weight; we have no hesitation in saying, that the weight necessary to crush the whole collection is proportional to their number or to the area of the section. But when they are in contact (and still more if they cohere), we imagine that the case is materially altered. Any individual ball is crushed only in consequence of its being bulged outwards in the direction perpendicular to the pressure employed. If this could be prevented by a hoop put round the ball like an equator, we cannot see how any force can crush it. Anything therefore which makes this bulging outwards more difficult, makes a greater force necessary. Now this effect will be produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> contact of the balls before the pressure is applied; for the central ball cannot swell outward laterally without pushing away the balls on all sides of it. This is prevented by the friction on the table and upper board.\nStrength of board, which is at least equal to one third of the pref-\nMaterials. sure. Thus any interior ball becomes stronger by the\nmere vicinity of the others; and if we farther suppose\nthem to cohere laterally, we think that its strength will\nbe still more increased.\n\nThe analogy between these balls and the cohering\nparticles of a friable body is very perfect. We should\ntherefore expect that the strength by which it resists being\ncrushed will increase in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> than that of the\nsection, or the square of the diameter of similar sec-\ntions; and that a square inch of any matter will bear a\ngreater weight in proportion as it makes a part of a\ngreater section. Accordingly this appears in many ex-\nperiments, as will be noticed afterwards. Muthenbroek,\nEuler, and some others, have supposed the strength of\ncolumns to be as the biquadrates of their diameters.\nBut Euler deduced this from formulae which occurred\nto him in the course of his algebraic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>; and he\nboldly adopts it as a principle, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> for its\nfoundation in the physical assumptions which he had\nmade in the beginning of his investigation. But some\nof his original assumptions were as paradoxical, or at\nleast as gratuitous, as these results; and those, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">par</a>-\nticular, from which this proportion of the strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COL\">col</a>-\numns was deduced, were almost foreign to the case;\nand therefore the inference was of no value. Yet it was\nreceived as a principle by Muthenbroek and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACA\">aca</a>-\ndemicians of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETERBURGH\">Peterburgh</a>. We make these very few\nobservations, because the subject is of great practical\nimportance; and it is a great obstacle to improvements\nwhen deference to a great name, joined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCAPACITY\">incapacity</a> or\nindolence, causes authors to adopt his careless reveries as\nprinciples from which they are afterwards to draw im-\nportant consequences. It must be acknowledged that\nwe have not as yet established the relation between the\ndimensions and the strength of a pillar on solid mechan-\nical principles. Experience plainly contradicts the gen-\neral opinion, that the strength is proportional to the\narea of the section; but it is still more inconsistent with\nthe opinion, that it is in the quadruplicate ratio of the\ndiameters of similar sections. It would seem that the\nratio depends much on the internal structure of the bo-\ndy; and experiment seems the only method for ascer-\ntaining its general laws.\n\nIf we suppose the body to be of a fibrous texture,\nhaving the fibres situated in the direction of the pressure,\nand slightly adhering to each other by some kind of ce-\nment, such a body will fail only by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of the\nfibres, by which they will break the cement and be de-\ntached from each other. Something like this may be\nsupposed in wooden pillars. In such cases, too it would\nappear that the resistance must be as the number of equal-\nly resisting fibres, and as their mutual support, jointly;\nand, therefore, as some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the area of the sec-\ntion. The same thing must happen if the fibres are na-\nturally crooked or undulated, as is observed in many\nwoods, &c., provided we suppose some similarity in their\nform. Similarity of some kind must always be supposed,\notherwise we need never aim at any general inferences.\n\nIn all cases therefore we can hardly refuse admitting\nthat the strength in opposition to compression is propor-\ntional to a function of the area of the section.\n\nAs the whole length of a cylinder or prism is equally\nprefixed, it does not appear that the strength of a pillar\nis at all affected by its length. If indeed it be supposed\nto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> under the pressure, the case is greatly changed,\nbecause it is then exposed to a transverse strain; and this\nincreases with the length of the pillar. But this will\nbe considered with due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> under the next clas-\nof strains.\n\nFew experiments have been made on this species of\nstrength and strain. Mr Petit says, that his experiments\nand those of Mr Parent, show that the force necessary for\ncrushing a body is nearly equal to that which will tear it\nasunder. He says that it requires something more than\n60 pounds on every square line to crush a piece of sound\noak. But the rule is by no means general; Glaes, for\ninstance, will carry a hundred times as much as oak in\nthis way, that is, resisting it; but will not suspend\nabove four or five times as much. Oak will suspend a\ngreat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more than fir; but fir will carry twice as\nmuch as a pillar. Woods of a soft texture, although\nconsisting of very tenacious fibres, are more easily crushed\nby their load. This softness of texture is chiefly owing\nto their fibres not being straight but undulated, and\nthere being considerable vacuities between them, so that\nthey are easily bent laterally and crushed. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>\nis overstrained by its load, it is observed to swell sensibly\nin diameter. Increasing the load causes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a>\ncracks or shivers to appear, and it presently after gives\nway. This is called crippling.\n\nIn all cases where the fibres lie oblique to the strain\nthe strength is greatly diminished, because the parts can\nthen be made to slide on each other, when the cohesion\nof the cementing matter is overcome.\n\nMuthenbroek has given some experiments on this\nsubject; but they are cases of long pillars, and therefore\ndo not belong to this place. They will be considered\nafterwards.\n\nThe only experiments of which we have seen any de-\ntail (and it is useless to insert mere assertions) are those\nof Mr Gauthey, in the 4th volume of Rozier's Journal\nde Physique. This engineer exposed to great pressures\nsmall rectangular parallelepipeds, cut from a great va-\nriety of stones, and noted the weights which crushed\nthem. The following table exhibits the medium results\nof many trials on two very uniform kinds of freestone,\none of them among the hardest and the other among the\nsoftest used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>.\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">Column</a> 1st expresses the length AB of the section in French lines or 12ths of an inch; column 2nd expresses the breadth BC; column 3rd is the area of the section this pur-\npose made required to crush the piece; column 5th is the weight which was then borne by each square line of the sec-\ntion; and column 6th is the round numbers to which Mr Gauthey imagines that those in column 5th approximate.\n\n### Hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a>\n\n| AB | BC | AB \u00d7 BC | Weight | Force |\n|----|----|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1  | 8  | 8       | 64     | 736   | 11.5  |\n| 2  | 8  | 12      | 96     | 2625  | 27.3  |\n| 3  | 8  | 16      | 128    | 4496  | 35.1  |\n\n### Soft Stone\n\n| 4  | 9  | 16      | 144    | 560   | 3.9   |\n| 5  | 9  | 18      | 162    | 848   | 5.3   |\n| 6  | 18 | 18      | 324    | 29.8  | 9     |\n| 7  | 18 | 24      | 432    | 5296  | 12.2  |\nLittle can be deduced from these experiments: The 1st and 3rd, compared with the 5th and 6th, should furnish similar results; for the 1st and 5th are respectively half of the 3rd and 6th; but the 3rd is three times stronger (that is, a line of the 3rd) than the first, whereas the 6th is only twice as strong as the 5th.\n\nIt is evident, however, that the strength increases much faster than the area of the section, and that a square line can carry more and more weight, according as it makes a part of a larger and larger section. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments on the soft stone, the individual strength of a square line seems to increase nearly in the proportion of the section of which it makes a part.\n\nMr Gauthey deduces, from the whole of his numerous experiments, that a pillar of hard stone of Givry, whose section is a square foot, will bear with perfect safety 664,000 pounds, and that its extreme strength is 871,000, and the smallest strength observed in any of his experiments was 460,000. The soft bed of Givry stone had for its smallest strength 187,000, for its greatest 311,000, and for its safe load 249,000. Good brick will carry with safety 320,000; chalk will carry only 9000. The boldest piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> in this respect which he has seen is a pillar in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALL_SAINTS\">All-Saints</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGERS\">Angers</a>. It is 24 feet long and 11 inches square, and is loaded with 60,000, which is not one-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> of what is necessary for crushing it.\n\nWe may observe here by the way, that Mr Gauthey's measure of the suspending strength of stone is vastly small in proportion to its power of supporting a load laid above it. He finds that a prism of the hard bed of Givry, of a foot section, is torn asunder by 4600 pounds; and if it be firmly fixed horizontally in a wall, it will be broken by a weight of 56,000 suspended a foot from the wall. If it rest on two props at a foot distance, it will be broken by 206,000 laid on its middle. These experiments agree so well with each other, that little use can be made of them. The subject is of great importance, and well deserves the attention of the patriotic philosopher.\n\nA set of good experiments would be very valuable, because it is against this kind of strain that we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> by judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> in the most delicate and difficult problems which come through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> engineer. The construction of stone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, and the construction of great wooden bridges, and particularly the construction of the frames of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTRY\">carpentry</a> called centres in the erection of stone bridges, are the most difficult jobs that occur. In the centres on which the arches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> were built some of the pieces of oak were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> upwards of two tons on every square inch of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANTLING\">scantling</a>. All who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it said that it was not able to carry the fourth part of the intended load. But the engineer understood the principles of his art, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAN\">ran</a> the risk; and the result completely justified his confidence; for the centre did not complain in any part, only it was found too supple; so that it went out of shape while the haunches only of the arch were laid on it. The engineer corrected this by loading it at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, and thus kept it completely in shape during the progress of the work.\n\nIn the Memoirs (old) of the Academy of Peterburgh for 1778, there is a dissertation by Euler on this subject, but particularly limited to the strain on columns, in which the bending is taken into the account. Mr Fuss has treated the same subject with relation to carpentry in a subsequent volume. But there is little in these papers besides a dry mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>, proceeding on assumptions which (to speak favourably) are extremely gratuitous. The most important consequence of the compression is wholly overlooked, as we shall presently see. Our knowledge of the mechanism of cohesion is as yet far too imperfect to entitle us to a confident application of mathematics. Experiments should be multiplied.\n\nThe only way we can hope to make these experiments useful is to pay a careful attention to the manner in which the fracture is produced. By discovering the general resemblances in this particular, we advance a step in our power of introducing mathematical measurement. Thus, when a cubical piece of chalk is slowly crushed between the chaps of a vice, we see it uniformly split in a surface oblique to the pressure, and the two parts then slide along the surface of fracture. This should lead us to examine mathematically what relation there is between this surface of fracture and the necessary force; then we should endeavour to determine experimentally the position of this surface. Having discovered some general law or resemblance in this circumstance, we should try what mathematical hypothesis will agree with this. Having found one, we may then apply our simplest notions of cohesion, and compare the result of our computations with experiment. We are authorized to say, that a series of experiments have been made in this way, and that their results have been very uniform, and therefore satisfactory, and that they will soon be laid before the public as the foundations of successful practice in the construction of arches.\n\nIII. A BODY MAY BE BROKEN ACROSS.\n\nThe most usual, and the greatest strain, to which materials are exposed, is that which tends to break them to pieces transversely. It is seldom, however, that this is done in what strain a manner perfectly simple; for when a beam projects and breaks horizontally from a wall, and a weight is suspended from a body its extremity, the beam is commonly broken near the transverse wall, and the intermediate part has performed the functions of a lever. It sometimes, though rarely, happens that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> in the joint of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of pincers or scissors is cut through by the strain; and this is almost the only case of a simple transverse fracture. Being so rare, we may content ourselves with saying, that in this case the strength of the piece is proportional to the area of the section.\n\nExperiments were made for discovering the resistances made by bodies to this kind of strain in the following manner: Two iron bars were disposed horizontally at an inch distance; a third hung perpendicularly between them, being supported by a pin made of the substance to be examined. This pin was made of a prismatic form, so as to fit exactly the holes in the three bars, which were made very exact, and of the same size and shape. A scale was suspended at the lower end of the perpendicular bar, and loaded till it tore out that part of the pin which filled the middle hole. This weight was evidently the measure of the lateral cohesion of two sections. The side-bars were made to grasp the middle bar pretty strongly between them, that there might be no distance imposed between the opposite pressures. This would have combined the energy of a lever with the purely transverse pressure. For the same reason it was neces-\nStrength of any that the internal parts of the holes should be no smaller than the edges. Great irregularities occurred in our first experiments from this cause, because the pins were somewhat tighter within than at the edges; but when this was corrected they were extremely regular.\n\nWe employed three sets of holes, viz. a circle, a square (which was occasionally made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> whose length was twice its breadth), and an equilateral triangle. We found in all our experiments the strength exactly proportional to the area of the section, and quite independent of its figure or position, and we found it considerably above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> cohesion; that is, it took considerably more than twice the force to tear out this middle piece than to tear the pin asunder by a direct pull. A piece of fine freestone required 205 pounds to pull it directly asunder, and 575 to break it in this way. The difference was very constant in any one substance, but varied from four-thirds to six-thirds in different kinds of matter, being smallest in bodies of a fibrous texture. But indeed we could not make the trial on any bodies of considerable cohesion, because they required such forces as our apparatus could not support. Chalk, clay baked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, baked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, brick, and freestone, were the strongest that we could examine.\n\nBut the more common case, where the energy of a lever intervenes, demands a minute examination.\n\nLet DABC (fig. 5) be a vertical section of a prismatic solid (that is, of equal size throughout), projecting horizontally from a wall in which it is firmly fixed; and let a weight P be hung on it at B, or let any power P act at B in a direction perpendicular to AB. Suppose the body of insuperable strength in every part except in the vertical section DA, perpendicular to its length. It must break in this section only. Let the cohesion be uniform over the whole of this section; that is, let each of the adjoining particles of the two parts cohere with an equal force f.\n\nThere are two ways in which it may break. The part ABCD may simply slide down along the surface of fracture, provided that the power acting at B is equal to the accumulated force which is exerted by every particle of the section in the direction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a>.\n\nBut suppose this effectually prevented by something that supports the point A. The action at P tends to make the body turn round A (or round a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line passing through A at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles to AB) as round a joint. This it cannot do without separating at the line DA. In this case the adjoining particles at D or E will be separated horizontally. But their cohesion resists this separation. In order, therefore, that the fracture may happen, the energy or momentum of the power P, acting by means of the lever AB, must be superior to the accumulated energies of the particles. The energy of each depends not only on its cohesive force, but also on its situation; for the supposed insuperable firmness of the rest of the body makes it a lever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round the fulcrum A, and the cohesion of each particle, such as D or E, acts by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> DA or EA. The energy of each particle will therefore be had by multiplying the force exerted by it in the instant of fracture by the arm of the lever by which it acts.\n\nLet us therefore first suppose, that in the instant of fracture every particle is exerting an equal force f. The energy of D will be $f \\times DA$, and that of E will be $f \\times EA$, and that of the whole will be the sum of all these products. Let the depth DA of the section be called d, and let any undetermined part of it EA be called x, and Materials. then the space occupied by any particle will be $x$. The cohesion of this space may be represented by $f \\times x$, and that of the whole by $f \\times d$. The energy by which each element $x$ of the line DA, or $d$, resists the fracture, will be $f \\times x$, and the whole accumulated energies will be $f \\times \\int x^2 dx$. This we know to be $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3$, or $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$. It is the same therefore as if the cohesion $f \\times d$ of the whole section had been acting at the point G, which is the middle of DA.\n\nThe reader who is not familiarly acquainted with this fluxionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> may arrive at the same conclusion in another way. Suppose the beam, instead of projecting horizontally from a wall, to be hanging from the ceiling, in which it is firmly fixed. Let us consider how the equal cohesion of every part operates in hindering the lower part from separating from the upper by opening round the joint A. The equal cohesion operates just as equal gravity would do, but in the opposite direction. Now we know, by the most elementary mechanics, that the effect of this will be the same as if the whole weight were concentrated in the centre of gravity G of the line DA, and that this point G is in the middle of DA. Now the number of fibres being as the length $d$ of the line, and the cohesion of each fibre being $=f$, the cohesion of the whole line is $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3$ or $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$.\n\nThe accumulated energy therefore of the cohesion in the instant of fracture is $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$. Now this must be equal or just inferior to the energy of the power employed to break it. Let the length AB be called l; then $P \\times l$ is the corresponding energy of the power. This gives us $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3 = p \\times l$ for the equation of equilibrium corresponding to the vertical section ADCB.\n\nSuppose now that the fracture is not permitted at DA, but at another section $a$ more remote from B. The body being prismatic, all the vertical sections are equal; and therefore $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d$ is the same as before. But the energy of the power is by this means increased, being now $= P \\times B \\times a$, instead of $P \\times BA$: Hence we see that when the prismatic body is not insuperably strong in all its parts, but equally strong throughout, it must break close at the wall, where the strain or energy of the power is greatest. We see, too, that a power which is just able to break it at the wall is unable to break it anywhere else; also an absolute cohesion $f \\times d$, which can withstand the power $p$ in the section DA, will not withstand it in the section $a$, and will withstand more in the section $d'$.\n\nThis teaches us to distinguish between absolute and relative strength. The relative strength of a section has a reference to the strain actually exerted on that section. This relative strength is properly measured by the power which is just able to balance or overcome it, when applied at its proper place. Now since we had $f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3 = p \\times l$, we have $p = \\frac{f \\times \\frac{1}{3} d^3}{l}$ for the measure of the strength of the section of the section DA, in relation to the power applied at B.\n\nIf the solid is a rectangular beam, whose breadth is b, it is plain that all the vertical sections are equal, and that AG or $\\frac{1}{3} d$ is the same in all. Therefore the equa-\nStrength often expressing the equilibrium between the momentum of the external force and the accumulated momenta of cohesion will be \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\).\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> \\( db \\) evidently expresses the area of the section of fracture, which we may call \\( s \\), and we may express the equilibrium thus, \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\), and \\( 2l : d = fs : p \\).\n\nNow \\( fs \\) is a proper expression of the absolute cohesion of the section of fracture, and \\( p \\) is a proper measure of its strength in relation to a power applied at B. We may therefore say, that twice the length of a rectangular beam is to the depth as the absolute cohesion to the relative strength.\n\nSince the action of equable cohesion is similar to the action of equal gravity, it follows, that whatever is the figure of the section, the relative strength will be the same as if the absolute cohesion of all the fibres were acting at the centre of gravity of the section. Let \\( g \\) be the distance between the centre of gravity of the section and the axis of fracture, we shall have \\( p = fsg \\), and \\( l : g = fs : p \\). It will be very useful to recollect this analogy in words: \"The length of a prismatic beam of any shape is to the height of the centre of gravity above the lower side, as the absolute cohesion to the strength relative to this length.\"\n\nBecause the relative strength of a rectangular beam is \\( \\frac{fb}{d} \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\) or \\( \\frac{fb}{d^2} \\), it follows, that the relative strengths of different beams are proportional to the absolute cohesion of the particles, to the breadth, and to the square of the depth directly, and to the length inversely; also in prisms whose sections are similar, the strengths are as the cubes of the diameters.\n\nSuch are the more general results of the mechanism of this transverse strain, in the hypothesis that all the particles are exerting equal forces in the instant of fracture. We are indebted for this doctrine to the celebrated Galileo; and it was one of the first specimens of the application of mathematics to the science of nature.\n\nWe have not included in the preceding investigation that action of the external force by which the solid is drawn sidewise, or tends to slide along the surface of fracture. We have supposed a particle E to be pulled only in the direction EA, perpendicular to the section of fracture, by the action of the crooked lever BAE. But it is also pulled in the direction EA; and its reaction is in some direction \\( \\epsilon E \\), compounded of \\( \\epsilon f \\), by which it resists being pulled outwards; and \\( \\epsilon e \\) by which it resists being pulled downwards. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the force \\( \\epsilon e \\), and only know that their accumulated sum is equal to the force \\( p \\); but in all important cases which occur in practice, it is unnecessary to attend to this force; because it is so small in comparison of the forces in the direction \\( \\epsilon e \\), as we easily conclude from the usual smallness of AD in comparison of AB.\n\nThe hypothesis of equal cohesion, exerted by all the particles in the instant of fracture, is not conformable to nature: for we know, that when a force is applied transversely at B, the beam is bent downwards, becoming convex on the upper side; that side is therefore on the stretch. The particles at D are farther removed from each other than those at E, and are therefore actually exerting greater cohesive forces. We cannot say with certainty and precision in what proportion each fibre is extended. It seems most probable that the extensions are proportional to the distances from A. We shall suppose this to be really the case. Now recollect the general law which we formerly said was observed in all moderate extensions, viz. that the attractive forces exerted by the dilated particles were proportional to their dilatations. Suppose now that the beam is so much bent that the particles at D are exerting their utmost force, and that this fibre is just ready to break or actually breaks. It is plain that a total fracture must immediately ensue; because the force which was superior to the full cohesion of the particle at D, and a certain portion of the cohesion of all the rest, will be more than superior to the full cohesion of the particle next within D, and a smaller portion of the cohesion of the remainder.\n\nNow let F represent, as before, the full force of the exterior fibre D, which is exerted by it in the instant of its breaking, and then the force exerted at the same instant by the fibre E will be had by this analogy, AD: AE, or \\( d : x = f : \\frac{f}{d} \\), and the force really exerted by the fibre E is \\( f \\times \\frac{x}{d} \\).\n\nThe force exerted by a fibre whose thickness is \\( x \\) is therefore \\( \\frac{fx}{d} \\); but this force resists the strain by acting by means of the lever EA or \\( x \\). Its energy or momentum is therefore \\( \\frac{fx}{d} \\), and the accumulated momenta of all the fibres in the line AE will be \\( f \\times \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>{sum of } \\frac{x}{d} \\). This, when \\( x \\) is taken equal to \\( d \\), will express the momentum of the whole fibres in the line AD. This, therefore, is \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\), or \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\), or \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\). Now \\( fbd \\) expresses the absolute cohesion of the whole line AD. The accumulated momentum is therefore the same as if the absolute cohesion of the whole line were exerted at one-third of AD from A.\n\nFrom these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> it follows that the equation expressing the equilibrium of the strain and cohesion is \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\); and hence we deduce the analogy, \"As the length is to the depth, so is the absolute cohesion to the relative strength.\"\n\nThis equation and this proportion will equally apply to rectangular beams whose breadth is \\( b \\); for we shall then have \\( p = fbd \\times \\frac{1}{d} \\).\n\nWe also see that the relative strength is proportional to the absolute cohesion of the particles, to the breadth, and to the square of the depth directly, and to the length inversely: for \\( p \\) is the measure of the force with which it is resisted, and \\( p = \\frac{fbd}{d} \\), \\( \\frac{fbd}{d} \\). In this respect therefore this hypothesis agrees with the Galilean; but it assigns to every beam a smaller proportion of the absolute cohesion of the section of fracture, in the proportion of three to two. In the Galilean hypothesis this section has a momentum equal to one-half of its absolute strength, but in the other hypothesis it is only one-third. In beams of a different form the proportion may be different.\n\nAs this is a most important proposition, and the foundation\nStrength of adhesion of many practical maxims, we are anxious to have it clearly comprehended, and its evidence perceived by all. Our better informed readers will therefore indulge us while we endeavour to present it in another point of view, where it will be better seen by those who are not familiarly acquainted with the fluxionary calculus.\n\nFig. 6. A is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of a three-sided beam projecting horizontally from a wall, and loaded with a weight at B just sufficient to break it. DABC is a vertical plane through its highest point D, in the direction of its length, aDa is another vertical section perpendicular to AB. The piece being supposed of insuperable strength everywhere except in the section aDa, and the cohesion being also supposed insuperable along the line aAa, it can break nowhere but in this section, and by turning round aAa as round a hinge. Make Dd equal to AD, and let Dd represent the absolute cohesion of the fibre at D, which absolute cohesion we express by the symbol f. Let a plane aDa be made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through aAa and d, and let d'a'd' be another cross section. It is plain that the prismatic solid contained between the two sections aDa and d'a'd' will represent the full cohesion of the whole section of fracture; for we may conceive this prism as made up of lines such as FF', equal and parallel to Dd, representing the absolute cohesion of each particle such as F. The pyramidal solid d'Daa, cut off by the plane daa, will represent the cohesions actually exerted by the different fibres in the instant of fracture. For take any point E in the surface of fracture, and draw Ee parallel to AB, meeting the plane aDa in e, and let eAE be a vertical plane. It is evident that Dd is to Ee as AD to AE; and therefore (since the forces exerted by the different fibres are as their extension, and their extension as their distances from the axis of fracture) Ee will represent the force actually exerted by the fibre in E, while D is exerting its full force Dd. In like manner, the plane FF'f' expresses the cohesion exerted by all the fibres in the line FF, and so on through the whole surface. Therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> daaD expresses the accumulated exertion of the whole surface of fracture.\n\nFurther, suppose the beam to be held perpendicular to the horizon with the end B uppermost, and that the weight of the prism contained between the two sections aDa and d'a'd' (now horizontal) is just able to overcome the full cohesion of the section of fracture. The weight of the pyramid d'Daa will also be just able to overcome the cohesions actually exerted by the different fibres in the instant of fracture; because the weight of each fibre, such as Ee, is just superior to the cohesion actually exerted at E.\n\nLet o be the centre of gravity of the pyramidal solid, and draw oO perpendicular to the plane aDa. The whole weight of the solid d'Daa may be conceived as accumulated in the point o, and as acting on the point O, and it will have the same tendency to separate the two cohering surfaces as when each fibre is hanging by its respective point. For this reason the point O may be called the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> effort of the unequal forces of cohesion. The momentum therefore, or energy by which the cohering surfaces are separated, will be properly measured by the weight of the solid d'Daa multiplied by OA; and this product is equal to the product of the weight p multiplied by BA, or by I.\n\nThus suppose that the cohesion along the line AD only strength of is considered. The whole cohesion will be represented by a triangle ADd'. Dd' represents f, and AD is d, and AD is x. Therefore ADd' is \\(\\frac{1}{2}fd'\\). The centre of gravity o of the triangle ADd' is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of a line drawn from A to the middle of Dd' with a line drawn from d' to the middle of AD; and therefore the line oO will make AO = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of AD. Therefore the actual momentum of cohesion is \\(f \\times \\frac{1}{2}d \\times \\frac{1}{3}d = \\frac{1}{6}fd^2\\), or equal to the absolute cohesion acting by means of the lever \\(\\frac{d}{3}\\). If the section of fracture is a rectangle, as in a common joint, whose breadth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">aa</a> is b, it is plain that all the vertical lines will be represented by triangles like ADd'; and the whole actual cohesion will be represented by a wedge whose bases are vertical planes, and which is equal to half of the parallelepiped AD \\(\\times\\) Dd' \\(\\times\\) aa, and will therefore be \\(\\frac{1}{2}fbd'\\); and the distance AO of its centre of gravity from the horizontal line AA' will be \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of AD. The momentum of cohesion of a joint will therefore be \\(\\frac{1}{6}fbd' \\times \\frac{1}{3}d\\), or \\(fbd'^2\\), as we have determined in the other way.\n\nThe beam represented in the figure is a triangular prism. The pyramid Daad is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the prism aaDd'a'. If we make s represent the surface of the triangle aDa, the pyramid is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of fs. The distance AO of its centre of gravity from the horizontal line AA' is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of AD, or \\(\\frac{1}{3}d\\). Therefore the momentum of actual cohesion is \\(\\frac{1}{6}fs \\times \\frac{1}{3}d = \\frac{1}{18}fd^2\\); that is, it is the same as if the full cohesion of all the fibres were accumulated at a point I whose distance from A is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)th of AD or d; or (that we may see its value in every point of view) it is \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)th of the momentum of the full cohesion of all the fibres when accumulated at the point D, or acting at the distance d = AD.\n\nThis is a very convenient way of conceiving the momentum of actual cohesion, by comparing it with the momentum of absolute cohesion applied at the distance AD from the axis of fracture. The momentum of the absolute cohesion applied at D is to the momentum of actual cohesion in the instant of fracture as AD to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AI\">AI</a>. Therefore the length of AI, or its proportion to AD, is a sort of index of the strength of the beam. We shall call it the Index, and express it by the symbol i.\n\nIts value is easily obtained. The product of the absolute cohesion by AI must be equal to that of the actual cohesion by AO. Therefore say, \"as the prismatic solid aaDd'a' is to the pyramidal solid aaDd', so is AO to AI.\" We are assisted in this determination by a very convenient circumstance. In this hypothesis of the actual cohesions being as the distances of the fibres from A, the point O is the centre of oscillation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERCUSSION\">percussion</a> of the surface Da a turning round the axis aa; for the momentum of cohesion of the line FF is FF \\(\\times\\) FF \\(\\times\\) EA = FF \\(\\times\\) EA, because FF is equal to EA. Now AO, by the nature of the centre of gravity, is equal to the sum of all these momenta divided by the pyramid aaDd'; that is, by the sum of all the FF \\(\\times\\) FF; that is, by the sum of all the FF \\(\\times\\) EA.\n\nTherefore AO = \\(\\frac{\\text{sum of FF} \\times \\text{EA}}{\\text{sum of FF} \\times \\text{EA}}\\), which is just the value of the distance of the centre of percussion of the triangle aaD from A: (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">Rotation</a>). Moreover, if\nStrength of G be the centre of gravity of the triangle \\(aDa\\), we shall have DA to GA as the absolute cohesion to the sum of the cohesions actually exerted in the instant of fracture; for, by the nature of this centre of gravity,\n\n\\[ AG \\text{ is equal to } \\frac{\\text{sum of } FF \\times EA}{\\text{sum of } FF}, \\]\n\nand the sum of \\(FF \\times EA\\) is equal to the sum of \\(FF \\times EA\\). But the sum of all the lines \\(FF\\) is the triangle \\(aDa\\), and the sum of all the \\(FF \\times EA\\) is the sum of all the rectangles \\(FFff\\); that is, the pyramid \\(dDa\\). Therefore a prism whose base is the triangle \\(aDa\\), and whose height is \\(AG\\), is equal to the pyramid, or will express the sum of the actual cohesions; and a prism, whose base is the same triangle, and whose height is \\(Dd\\) or \\(Da\\), expresses the absolute cohesion. Therefore DA is to GA as the absolute cohesion to the sum of the actual cohesions.\n\nTherefore we have DA : GA = OA : IA.\n\nTherefore, whatever be the form of the beam, that is, whatever be the figure of its section, find the centre of oscillation O, and the centre of gravity G of this section. Call their distances from the axis of fracture o and g. Then AI or \\(i = \\frac{og}{d}\\), and the momentum of cohesion is \\(fs \\times \\frac{og}{d}\\), where \\(s\\) is the area of fracture.\n\nThis index is easily determined in all the cases which generally occur in practice. In a rectangular beam AI is \\(d\\) AD; in a cylinder (circular or elliptic) AI is \\(2\\) AD; and so on.\n\nIn this hypothesis, that the cohesion actually exerted by each fibre is as its extension, and that the extensions of the fibres are as their distances from A (fig. 5), it is plain that the forces exerted by the fibres D, E, &c., will be represented by the ordinates \\(Dd\\), \\(Ee\\), &c., to a straight line \\(ad\\). And we learn from the principles of Rotation that the centre of percussion O is in the ordinate which passes through the centre of gravity of the triangle \\(ADd\\), or (if we consider the whole section having breadth as well as depth) through the centre of gravity of the solid bounded by the planes \\(DA\\), \\(dA\\); and we found that this point O was the centre of effort of the cohesions actually exerted in the instant of fracture, and that I was the centre of an equal momentum, which would be produced if all the fibres were accumulated there and exerted their full cohesion.\n\nThis consideration enables us to determine, with equal facility and neatness, the strength of a beam in any hypotheses of forces. The above hypothesis was introduced with a cautious limitation to moderate strains, which produced no permanent change of form, or no set as the artists call it; and this suffices for all purposes of practice, seeing that it would be imprudent to expose materials to more violent strains. But when we compare this theory with experiments in which the pieces are really broken, considerable deviations may be expected, because it is very probable that in the vicinity of rupture the forces are no longer proportional to the extensions.\n\nThat no doubt may remain as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> and completeness of the theory, we must show how the relative strength may be determined in any other hypothesis. Therefore suppose that it has been established by experiment on any kind of solid matter, that the forces actually exerted in the instant of fracture by the fibres at D, E, &c., are as the ordinates \\(Dd\\), \\(Ee\\), &c., of any strength of curve line \\(Ae'd'\\). We are supposed to know the form of this curve, and that of the solid which is bounded by the vertical plane through AD, and by the surface which passes through this curve \\(Ae'd'\\) perpendicularly to the length of the beam. We know the place of the centre of gravity of this curve surface or solid, and can draw a line through it parallel to AB, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the surface of fracture in some point O. This point is also the centre of effort of all the cohesions actually exerted; and the product of AO and of the solid which expresses the actual cohesions will give the momentum of cohesion equivalent to the former \\(fs \\times \\frac{og}{d}\\). Or we may find an index AI, by making AI a fourth proportional to the full cohesion of the surface of fracture, to the accumulated actual cohesions, and to AO; and then \\(fs \\times i\\) (=AI) will be the momentum of cohesion; and we shall still have I for the point in which all the fibres may be supposed to exert their full cohesion \\(f\\), and to produce a momentum of cohesion equal to the real momentum of the cohesions actually exerted, and the relative strength of the beam will still be \\(p = \\frac{fsi}{l} = \\frac{fsgo}{dl}\\).\n\nThus, if the forces be as the squares of the extensions (still supposed to be as the distances from A), the curve \\(Ae'd'\\) will be a common parabola, having AB for its axis and AD for the tangent at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a>. The area \\(ADd'\\) will be \\(dAD \\times Dd\\); and in the case of a rectangular beam, AO will be \\(d\\) AD, and AI will be \\(d\\) AD.\n\nWe may observe here in general, that if the forces actually exerted in the instant of fracture be as any power \\(q\\) of the distance from A, the index AI will be \\(= \\frac{AD}{q+2}\\) for a rectangular beam, and the momentum of cohesion will always be (ceteris paribus) as the breadth and as the square of the depth; nay, this will be the case whenever the action of the fibres D and E is expressed by any similar functions of \\(d\\) and \\(x\\). This is evident to every reader acquainted with the fluxionary calculus.\n\nAs far as we can judge from experience, no simple algebraic power of the distance will express the actual cohesions of the fibres. No curve which has either AD or AB for its tangent will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>. The observations which we made in the beginning show, that although the curve of fig. 2, must be sensibly straight in the vicinity of the points of intersection with the axis, in order to agree with our observations which show the moderate extensions to be as the extending forces, the curve must be concave towards the axis in all its attractive branches, because it cuts it again. Therefore the curve \\(Ae'd'\\) of fig. 5, must make a finite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with AD or AB, and it must, in all probability, be also concave towards AD in the neighbourhood of \\(d'\\). It may however be convex in some part of the intermediate arch. We have made experiments on the extensions of different bodies, and find great diversities in this respect: But in all, the moderate extensions were as the forces, and this with great accuracy till the body took a set, and remained longer than formerly when the extending force was removed.\n\nWe must now remark, that this correction of the Galilean hypothesis of equal forces was suggested by the bending...\nStrength of bending which is observed in all bodies which are strained transversely. Because they are bent, the fibres on the convex side have been extended. We cannot say in what proportion this obtains in the different fibres. Our most distinct notions of the internal equilibrium between the particles render it highly probable that their extension is proportional to their distance from that fibre which retains its former dimensions. But by whatever law this is regulated, we see plainly that the actions of the stretched fibres must follow the proportions of some function of this distance, and that therefore the relative strength of a beam is in all cases susceptible of mathematical determination.\n\nWe also see an intimate connection between the strain and the curvature. This suggested to the celebrated James Bernoulli the problem of the Elastic Curve, i.e., the curve into which an extensible rigid body will be bent by a transverse strain. His solution in the Acta Lipiae 1694 and 1695 is a very beautiful specimen of mathematical discussion; and we recommend it to the perusal of the curious reader. He will find it very perspicuously treated in the first volume of his works, published after his death, where the wide steps which he had taken in his investigation are explained so as to be easily comprehended. His nephew Daniel Bernoulli has given an elegant abridgement in the Petersburg Memoirs for 1729. The problem is too intricate to be fully discussed in a work like ours; but it is also too intimately connected with our present subject to be entirely omitted. We must content ourselves with showing the leading mechanical properties of this curve, from which the mathematician may deduce all its geometrical properties.\n\nWhen a bar of uniform depth and breadth, and of a given length, is bent into an arch of a circle, the extension of the outer fibres is proportional to the curvature; for, because the curves formed by the inner and outer sides of the beam are similar, the circumferences are as the radii, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the inner circle is to the difference of the radii as the length of the inner circumference is to the difference of the circumferences. The difference of the radii is the depth of the beam, the difference of the circumferences is the extension of the outer fibres, and the inner circumference is supposed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> length of the beam. Now the second and third quantities of the above analogy, viz., the depth and length of the beam, are constant quantities, as is also their product. Therefore the product of the inner radius and the extension of the outer fibre is also a constant quantity, and the whole extension of the outer fibre is inversely as the radius of curvature, or is directly as the curvature of the beam.\n\nThe mathematical reader will readily see, that into whatever curve the elastic bar is bent, the whole extension of the outer fibre is equal to the length of a similar curve, having the same proportion to the thickness of the beam that the length of the beam has to the radius of curvature.\n\nNow let ADCB (fig. 7.) be such a rod, of uniform breadth and thickness, firmly fixed in a vertical position, and bent into a curve AETB by a weight W suspended at B, and of such magnitude that the extremity B has its tangent perpendicular to the action of the weight, or parallel to the horizon. Suppose too that the extensions are proportional to the extending forces. From any two points E and F draw the horizontal ordinates EG, FH. It is evident that the exterior fibres of the sections Ee and Ff are stretched by forces which are in the proportion of EG to FH (these being the long arms of the levers, and the equal thicknesses Ee, Ff being the short arms). Therefore (by the hypothesis) their extensions are in the same proportion. But because the extensions are proportional to some similar functions of the distance from the axes of fracture E and F, the extension of any fibre in the section Ee is to the contemporaneous extension of the similarly situated fibre in the section Ff, as the extension of the exterior fibre in the section Ee is to the extension of the exterior fibre in the section Ff; therefore the whole extension of Ee is to the whole extension of Ff as EG to FH, and EG is to FH as the curvature in E to the curvature in F.\n\nHere let it be remarked, that this proportionality of the curvature to the extension of the fibres is not limited to the hypothesis of the proportionality of the extensions to the extending forces. It follows from the extension in the different sections being as some similar function of the distance from the axis of fracture; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> which cannot be refused.\n\nThis then is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> property of the elastic curve, from which its equation, or relation between the abscissa and ordinate, may be deduced in the usual forms, and all its other geometrical properties. These are foreign to our purpose; and we shall notice only such properties as have an immediate relation to the strain and strength of the different parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> body, and which in particular serve to explain some difficulties in the valuable experiments of M. Buffon on the Strength of Beams.\n\nWe observe, in the first place, that the elastic curve is not a circle, but is gradually more incurvated as it recedes from the point of application B of the straining forces. At B it has no curvature; and if the bar were extended beyond B there would be no curvature there. In like manner, when a beam is supported at the ends and loaded in the middle, the curvature is greatest in the middle; but at the props, or beyond them, if the beam extend farther, there is no curvature. Therefore when a beam projecting 20 feet from a wall is bent to a certain curvature at the wall by a weight suspended at the end, and a beam of the same size projecting 20 feet is bent to the very same curvature at the wall by a greater weight at 10 feet distance, the figure and the mechanical state of the beam in the vicinity of the wall is different in these two cases, though the curvature at the very wall is the same in both. In the first case every part of the beam is incurvated; in the second, all beyond the 10 feet is without curvature. In the first experiment the curvature at the distance of five feet from the wall is three-fourths of the curvature at the wall; in the second, the curvature at the same place is but one-half of that at the wall. This must weaken the long beam in this whole interval of five feet, because the greater curvature is the result of a greater extension of the fibres.\n\nIn the next place, we may remark, that there is a certain determinate curvature for every beam which cannot be exceeded without breaking it; for there is a certain separation of two adjoining particles that puts an end to their cohesion. A fibre can therefore...\nStrength of be extended only a certain proportion of its length.\n\nThe ultimate extension of the outer fibres must bear a certain determinate proportion to its length, and this proportion is the same with that of the thickness (or what we have hitherto called the depth) to the radius of ultimate curvature, which is therefore determinate.\n\nA beam of uniform breadth and depth is therefore most incurvated where the strain is greatest, and will break in the most incurvated part. But by changing its form, so as to make the strength of its different sections in the ratio of the strain, is evident that the curvature may be the same throughout, or may be made to vary according to any law. This is a remarkable problem in practical mechanics is so to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> the balance-spring of a watch that its wide and narrow vibrations may be isochronous. Hooke's principle ut tensio sic vis is not sufficient when we take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> and motion of the spring itself into the account. The figure into which it bends and unbends has also an influence. Our readers will take notice that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">artificer</a> aims at an accuracy which will not admit an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of \\( \\frac{1}{8000} \\)th, and that Harrison and Arnold have actually attained it in several instances. The taper of a spring is at present a nostrum in the hands of each artificer, and he is careful not to impart his secret.\n\nAgain, since the depth of the beam is thus proportional to the radius of ultimate curvature, this ultimate or breaking curvature is inversely as the depth. It may be expressed by \\( \\frac{I}{d} \\).\n\nWhen a weight is hung on the end of a prismatic beam, the curvature is nearly as the weight and the length directly, and as the breadth and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of the depth inversely; for the strength is \\( \\frac{b^2 d^3}{3l} \\). Let us suppose that this produces the ultimate curvature \\( \\frac{I}{d} \\).\n\nNow let the beam be loaded with a smaller weight \\( w \\), and let the curvature produced be \\( C \\), we have this analogy \\( \\frac{b^2 d^3}{3l} : w = \\frac{1}{d} : C \\), and \\( C = \\frac{3lw}{fb^2 d^3} \\). It is evident that this is also true of a beam supported at the ends and loaded between the props; and we see how to determine the curvature in its different parts, whether arising from the load, or from its own weight, or from both.\n\nWhen a beam is thus loaded at the end or middle, the loaded point is pulled down, and the space through which it is drawn may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>. This may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUBTENSE\">subtense</a> of the angle of contact, or as the versed sine of the arch into which the beam is bent, and is therefore as the curvature when the length of the arches is given (the flexure being moderate), and as the square of the length of the arch when the curvature is given. The deflection therefore is as the curvature and as the square of the length of the arch jointly; that is, \\( \\frac{3lw}{fb^2 d^3} \\times l^2 \\), or as \\( \\frac{3lw}{fb^2 d^3} \\). The deflection from the primitive shape is therefore as the bending weight and the cube of the length directly, and as the breadth and cube of the depth inversely.\n\nIn beams just ready to break, the curvature is as the depth inversely, and the deflection is as the square of strength of the length divided by the depth; for the ultimate curvature at the breaking part is the same whatever is the length; and in this case the deflection is as the square of the length.\n\nWe have been the more particular in our consideration from this subject, because the resulting theorems afford us a fine method of examining the laws of corporeal nature and action, that is, for discovering the variation of the force of cohesion by a change of distance. It is true it is not amenable to the atomic law, or Hylarchic Principle as it may the laws of justly be called, which is thus made accessible, but the specific law of the particles of the substance or kind of matter under examination. But even this is a very great point; and coincidences in this respect among the different kinds of matter are of great moment. We may thus learn the nature of the corporeal action of different substances, and perhaps approach to a discovery of the mechanism of chemical affinities. For that chemical actions are insensible cases of local motion is undeniable, and local motion is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of mechanical diffusion; nay, we see that these hidden changes are produced by mechanical forces in many important cases, for we see them promoted or prevented by means purely mechanical. The conversion of bodies into elastic vapour by heat can at all times be prevented by a sufficient external pressure. A strong solution of Glauber's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> will congeal in an instant by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, giving out its latent heat; and it will remain fluid for ever, and return its latent heat in a close vessel which it completely fills. Even water will by such treatment freeze in an instant by agitation, or remain fluid for ever by confinement. We know that heat is produced or extracted by friction, that certain compounds of gold or silver with saline matters explode with irresistible violence by the smallest pressure or agitation. Such facts should rouse the mathematical philosopher, and excite him to follow out the conjectures of the illustrious Newton, encouraged by the ingenious attempts of Bofovich; and the proper beginning of this study is to attend to the laws of attraction and repulsion exerted by the particles of cohering bodies, discoverable by experiments made on their actual extensions and compressions. The experiments of simple extensions and compressions are quite insufficient, because the total stretching of a wire is so small a quantity, that the mistake of the thousandth part of an inch occasions an irregularity which deranges any progression so as to make it useless. But by the bending of bodies, a diffusion of \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\)th of an inch may be easily magnified in the deflection of the spring ten thousand times. We know that the investigation is intricate and difficult, but not beyond the reach of our present mathematical attainments; and it will give very fine opportunities of employing all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of analysis. In the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th this was a sufficient excitement to the first geniuses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The cycloid, the catenaria, the elastic curve, the velaria, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUSTICS\">caustics</a>, were reckoned an abundant recompense for much study; and James Bernoulli requested, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> monument, that the logarithmic spiral might be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> on his tombstone. The reward for the study to which we now presume to incite the mathematicians is the almost unlimited extension of natural science, important in every particular branch. To go no further than our present subject, a great deal of important practical knowledge\nStrength of bodies respecting the strength of bodies is derived from the single observation, that in the moderate extensions which happen before the parts are overstretched the forces are nearly in the proportion of the extensions or separations of the particles. To return to our subject.\n\nJames Bernoulli, in his second dissertation on the elastic curve, calls in question this law, and accommodates his investigation to any hypothesis concerning the relation of the forces and extensions. He relates some experiments of late strings where the relation was considerably different. Strings of three feet long,\n\n| Stretched by | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 pds. |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Were lengthened | 9, 17, 23, 27, 30 lines |\n\nBut this is a most exceptionable form of the experiment. The strings were twisted, and the mechanism of the extensions is here exceedingly complicated, combined with compressions and with transverse twists, &c. We made experiments on fine slips of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAOUTCHOUC\">caoutchouc</a>, and on the juice of the berries of the white bryony, of which a single grain will draw to a thread of two feet long, and again return into a perfectly round sphere. We measured the diameter of the thread by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> with a micrometer, and thus could tell in every state of extension the proportional number of particles in the sections. We found, that though the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> in which the distance of the particles was changed in the proportion of 13 to 1, the extensions did not sensibly deviate from the proportion of the forces. The same thing was observed in the caoutchouc as long as it perfectly recovered its first dimensions. And it is on the authority of these experiments that we presume to announce this as a law of nature.\n\nDr Robert Hooke was undoubtedly the first who attended to this subject, and assumed this as a law of nature. Mariotte indeed was the first who expressly used it for determining the strength of beams: this he did about the 1679, correcting the simple theory of Galileo. Leibnitz indeed, in his dissertation in the Acta Eruditorum 1684 de Reflextionis Solidorum, introduces this consideration, and wishes to be considered as the discoverer; and he is always acknowledged as such by the Bernoullis and others who adhered to his peculiar doctrines. But Mariotte had published the doctrine in the most approved terms long before; and Bullinger, in the Comment. Petropol. 1729, completely vindicates his claim. But Hooke was unquestionably the discoverer of this law. It made the foundation of his theory of springs, announced to the Royal Society about the year 1661, and read in 1666. On this occasion he mentions many things on the strength of bodies as quite familiar to his thoughts, which are immediate deductions from this principle; and among these all the facts which John Bernoulli so vauntingly adduces in support of Leibnitz's finical dogmas about the force of bodies in motion; a doctrine which Hooke might have claimed as his own, had he not perceived its frivolous insanity.\n\nBut even with this first correction of Mariotte, the mechanism of transverse strain is not fully nor justly explained. The force acting in the direction BP (fig. 5.), and bending the body ABCD, not only stretches the fibres on the side opposite to the axis of fracture, but compresses the fibre AB, which becomes concave by the strain. Indeed it cannot do the one without doing the other: For in order to stretch the fibres at D, there must be some fulcrum, some support, on which the vir-Strength of tual lever BAD may press, that it may tear afunder the stretched fibres. This fulcrum must sustain both the pressure arising from the cohesion of the distended fibres, and also the action of the external force, which immediately tends to cause the prominent part of the beam to slide along the section DA. Let BAD (fig. 5.) be considered as a crooked lever, of which A is the fulcrum. Let an external force be applied at B in the direction BP, and let a force equal to the accumulated cohesion of AD be applied at O in the direction opposite to AB, that is, perpendicular to AO; and let these two forces be supposed to balance each other by the intervention of the lever. In the first place, the force at O must be to the force at B as AB to AO: Therefore, if we make AK equal and opposite to AO, and AL equal and opposite to AB, the common principles of mechanics inform us that the fulcrum A is affected in the same manner as if the two forces AK and AL were immediately applied to it, the force AK being equal to the weight P, and AL equal to the accumulated cohesion actually exerted in the instant of fracture. The fulcrum is therefore really pressed in the direction AM, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> of the parallelogram, and it must resist in the direction and with the force MA; and this power of resistance, this support, must be furnished by the repulsive forces exerted by those particles only which are in a state of actual compression. The force AK, which is equal to the external force P, must be resisted in the direction KA by the lateral cohesion of the whole particles between D and A (the particle D is not only drawn forward but downward). This prevents the part CDAB from sliding down along the section DA.\n\nThis is fully verified by experiment. If we attempt to break a long slip of cork, or any such very compressible body, we always observe it to bulge out on the concave side before it cracks on the other side. If it is a body of fibrous or foliated texture, it seldom fails splintering off on the concave side; and in many cases this splintering is very deep, even reaching half way through the piece. In hard and granulated bodies, such as a piece of freestone, chalk, dry clay, sugar, and the like, we generally see a considerable splinter or shiver fly off from the hollow side. If the fracture be slowly made by a force at B gradually augmented, the formation of the splinter is very distinctly seen. It forms a triangular piece like a Ib, which generally breaks in the middle. We doubt not but that attentive observation would show that the direction of the crack on each side of I is not very different from the direction AM and its correspondent on the other side. This is by no means a circumstance of idle curiosity, but intimately connected with the mechanism of cohesion.\n\nLet us see what consequences result from this state of consequence the case respecting the strength of bodies. Let DAKC be a fulcrum (fig. 8.) representing a vertical section of a prism of compressible materials, such as a piece of timber. Suppose the loaded with a weight P hung at its extremity. Suppose it of such a constitution that all the fibres in AD are in a state of dilatation, while those in AA are in a state of compression. In the instant of fracture the particles at D and E are with-held by forces D d, E e, and the particles at A and E repel, resist, or support, with forces A a, E e.\n\nSome line, such as d e A a, will limit all these ordinates.\nStrength of nates, which represent the forces actually exerted in the instant of fracture. If the forces be as the extensions and compressions, as we have great reason to believe, \\(d_e A\\) and \\(A_e d\\) will be two straight lines. They will form one straight line \\(d A d\\), if the forces which resist a certain dilatation are equal to the forces which resist an equal compression. But this is quite accidental, and is not strictly true in any body. In most bodies which have any considerable firmness, the compressions made by any external force are not so great as the dilatations which the same force would produce; that is, the repulsions which are excited by any supposed degree of compression are greater than the attractions excited by the same degree of dilatation. Hence it will generally follow, that the angle \\(d A D\\) is less than the angle \\(d A D\\), and the ordinates \\(D_d, E_e, \\&c.\\) are less than the corresponding ordinates \\(D_d, E_e, \\&c.\\).\n\nBut whatever be the nature of the line \\(d A d\\), we are certain of this, that the whole area \\(ADd\\) is equal to the whole area \\(A_d A_d\\); for as the force at \\(B\\) is gradually increased, and the parts between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) are more extended, and greater cohesive forces are excited, there is always such a degree of repulsive forces excited in the particles between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) that the one set precisely balances the other. The force at \\(B\\), acting perpendicularly to \\(AB\\), has no tendency to push the whole piece closer on the part next the wall or to pull it away. The sum of the attractive and repulsive forces actually excited must therefore be equal. These sums are represented by the two triangular areas, which are therefore equal.\n\nThe greater we suppose the repulsive forces corresponding to any degree of compression, in comparison with the attractive forces corresponding to the same degree of extension, the smaller will \\(A_d\\) be in comparison of \\(AD\\). In a piece of cork or sponge, \\(A_d\\) may chance to be equal to \\(AD\\), or even to exceed it; but in a piece of marble, \\(A_d\\) will perhaps be very small in comparison of \\(AD\\).\n\nNow it is evident that the repulsive forces excited between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) have no share in preventing the fracture. They rather contribute to it, by furnishing a fulcrum to the lever, by whose energy the cohesion of the particles in \\(AD\\) is overcome. Hence we see an important consequence of the compressibility of the body. Its power of resisting this transverse strain is diminished by it, and so much the more diminished as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a> is more compressible.\n\nThis is fully verified by some very curious experiments made by Du Hamel. He took 16 bars of willow 2 feet long and \\(1/2\\) an inch square, and supporting them by props under the ends, he broke them by weights hung on the middle. He broke 4 of them by weights of 40, 41, 47, and 52 pounds; the mean is 45. He then cut 4 of them \\(1/2\\) through on the upper side, and filled up the cut with a thin piece of harder wood stuck in pretty tight. These were broken by 48, 54, 50, and 52 pounds; the mean of which is 51. He cut other four \\(1/2\\) through, and they were broken by 47, 49, 50, 46; the mean of which is 48. The remaining four were cut \\(1/3\\)ds; and their mean strength was 42.\n\nAnother set of his experiments is still more remarkable.\n\nSix battens of willow 36 inches long and \\(1/2\\) square were broken by 525 pounds at a medium.\n\nSix bars were cut \\(1/2\\) through, and the cut filled with a wedge of hard wood stuck in with a little force; these broke with 551.\n\nSix bars were cut half through, and the cut was filled in the same manner; they broke with 542.\n\nSix bars were cut \\(1/3\\)s through; these broke with 530.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTEN\">batten</a> cut \\(1/4\\)ths through, and loaded till nearly broken, was unloaded, and the wedge taken out of the cut. A thicker wedge was put in tight, so as to make the batten straight again by filling up the space left by the compression of the wood; this batten broke with 577 pounds.\n\nFrom this it is plain that more than \\(1/3\\)ds of the thickness (perhaps nearly \\(1/4\\)ths) contributed nothing to the strength.\n\nThe point \\(A\\) is the centre of fracture in this case; and in order to estimate the strength of the piece, we may suppose that the crooked lever virtually concerned in the strain is \\(DAB\\). We must find the point \\(I\\), which is the centre of effort of all the attractive forces, or that point where the full cohesion of \\(AD\\) must be applied, so as to have a momentum equal to the accumulated momenta of all the variable forces. We must in like manner find the centre of effort \\(i\\) of the repulsive or supporting forces exerted by the fibres lying between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\).\n\nIt is plain, and the remark is important, that this last centre of effort is the real fulcrum of the lever, although \\(A\\) is the point where there is neither extension nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>; for the lever is supported in the same manner as if the repulsions of the whole line \\(AD\\) were exerted at that point. Therefore let \\(S\\) represent the surface of fracture from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\), and \\(f\\) represent the absolute cohesion of a fibre at \\(D\\) in the instant of fracture. We shall have \\(fS \\times I + i = pI\\), or \\(fI + i = fS : p\\); that is, the length \\(AB\\) is to the distance between the two centres of effort \\(I\\) and \\(i\\), as the absolute cohesion of the section between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) is to the relative strength of the section.\n\nIt would be perhaps more accurate to make \\(AI\\) and \\(Ai\\) equal to the distances of \\(A\\) from the horizontal lines passing through the centres of gravity of the triangles \\(dAD\\) and \\(dA_d\\). It is only in this construction that the points \\(I\\) and \\(i\\) are the centres of real effort of the accumulated attractions and repulsions. But \\(I\\) and \\(i\\), determined as we have done, are the points where the full, equal, actions may be all applied, so as to produce the same momenta. The final results are the same in both cases.\n\nThe attentive and duly informed reader will see that Mr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-BULFINCH\">Bulfinch</a>, in a very elaborate dissertation on the strength of beams in the Comment. Petropolitan. 1729, has committed several mistakes in his estimation of the actions of the fibres. We mention this because his reasonings are quoted and appealed to as authorities by Mutchtenbroek and other authors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>. The subject has been considered by many authors on the continent. We recommend to the reader's perusal the very minute disquisitions in the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris for 1752 by Varignon, the Memoirs for 1768 by Parent, and particularly that of Coulomb in the Mem. par les Savans Etrangers, tom. vii.\n\nIt is evident from what has been said above, that if \\(S\\) and \\(i\\) represent the surfaces of the sections above and below \\(A\\), and if \\(G\\) and \\(g\\) are the distances of their centres of gravity from \\(A\\), and \\(O\\) and \\(o\\) the distances of their centres...\nStrength of centres of oscillation, and D and d their whole depths, Materials.\n\nthe momentum of cohesion will be \\( \\frac{fS \\cdot G \\cdot O}{D} = \\frac{fS \\cdot g \\cdot o}{d} \\)\n\n\\( = p.l. \\)\n\nIf (as is most likely) the forces are proportional to the extensions and compressions, the distances AI and Ai, which are respectively \\( \\frac{G \\cdot O}{D} \\) and \\( \\frac{g \\cdot o}{d} \\), are respectively \\( \\frac{1}{3} DA \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\Delta A \\); and when taken together are \\( \\frac{1}{3} DA \\). If, moreover, the extensions are equal to the compressions in the instant of fracture, and the body is a rectangular prism like a common joist or beam, then DA and \\( \\Delta A \\) are also equal; and therefore the momentum of cohesion is \\( fb \\times \\frac{1}{3} d \\times \\frac{1}{3} d = \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{6} \\).\n\nHence we obtain this analogy, \"Six times the length is to the depth as the absolute cohesion of the section is to its relative strength.\"\n\nThus we see that the compressibility of bodies has a very great influence on their power of withstanding a transverse strain. We see that in this most favourable supposition of equal dilatations and compressions, the strength is reduced to one half of the value of what it would have been had the body been incompressible. This is by no means obvious; for it does not readily appear how compressibility, which does not diminish the cohesion of a single fibre, should impair the strength of the whole. The reason, however, is sufficiently convincing when pointed out. In the instant of fracture a smaller portion of the section is actually exerting cohesive forces, while a part of it is only serving as a fulcrum to the lever, by whose means the strain on the section is produced. We see too that this diminution of strength does not so much depend on the sensible compressibility, as on its proportion to the dilatability by equal forces. When this proportion is small, \\( \\Delta A \\) is small in comparison of AD, and a greater portion of the whole fibre is exerting attractive forces.\n\nThe experiments already mentioned, of Du Hamel de Monceau, on battens of willow, show that its compressibility is nearly equal to its dilatability. But the case is not very different in tempered steel. The famous Harrison, in the delicate experiments which he made while occupied in making his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> watch, discovered that a rod of tempered steel was nearly as much diminished in its length as it was augmented by the same external force. But it is not by any means certain that this is the proportion of dilatation and compression which obtains in the very instant of fracture. We rather imagine that it is not. The forces are nearly as the dilatations till very near breaking; but we think that they diminish when the body is just going to break. But it seems certain that the forces which resist compression increase faster than the compressions, even before fracture. We know incontrovertibly that the ultimate refinements to compression are insuperable by any force which we can employ. The repulsive forces therefore (in their whole extent) increase faster than the compressions, and are expressed by an asymptotic branch of the Bofcovician curve formerly explained. It is therefore probable, especially in the more simple substances, that they increase faster, even in such compressions as frequently obtain in the breaking of hard bodies. We are disposed to think that this is always the case in such bodies as do not fly off in splinters on the concave side; but this must be understood with the exception of the permanent changes of which may be made by compression, when the bodies are crippled by it. This always increases the compression itself, and causes the neutral point to shift still more towards D. The effect of this is sometimes very great and fatal.\n\nExperiment alone can help us to discover the proportion between the dilatability and compressibility of bodies. The strain now under consideration seems the best calculated for this research. Thus if we find that a piece of wood an inch square requires 12,000 pounds to tear it asunder by a direct pull, and that 200 pounds will break it transversely by acting 10 inches from the section of fracture, we must conclude that the neutral point A is in the middle of the depth, and that the attractive and repulsive forces are equal. Any notions that we can form of the constitution of such fibrous bodies as timber, make us imagine that the sensible compressions, including what arises from the bending up of the compressed fibres, is much greater than the real corporeal extensions. One may get a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of this unexpected proposition by reflecting on what must happen during the fracture. An undulated fibre can only be drawn straight, and then the corporeal extension begins; but it may be bent up by compression to any degree, the corporeal compression being little affected all the while. This observation is very important; and though the forces of corporeal repulsion may be almost insuperable by any compression that we can employ, a sensible compression may be produced by forces not enormous, sufficient to cripple the beam. Of this we shall see very important instances afterwards.\n\nIt deserves to be noticed, that although the relative strength of a prismatic fold is extremely different in the proportional three hypotheses now considered, yet the proportional strengths of different pieces follow the same ratio; namely, the direct ratio of the breadth, the direct ratio of the square of the depth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> ratio of the same length. In the first hypothesis (of equal forces) the strength of a rectangular beam was \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{2l} \\); in the second (of attractive forces proportioned to the extensions) it was \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{3l} \\); and in the third (equal attractions and repulsions proportional to the extensions and compressions) it was \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{6l} \\), or more generally \\( \\frac{fb \\cdot d^2}{ml} \\), where m expresses the unknown proportion between the attractions and repulsions corresponding to an equal extension and compression.\n\nHence we derive a piece of useful information, which is confirmed by unexceptionable experience, that the strength of a piece depends chiefly on its depth, that is, a piece deep in that dimension which is in the direction of the strain, pends chiefly on its depth is four times as strong as a bar of only one inch deep, and it is twice as strong as a bar two inches broad and one deep; that is, a joist or lever is always strongest when laid on its edge.\n\nThere is therefore a choice in the manner in which force a the cohesion is opposed to the strain. The general aim must be to put the centre of effort I as far from the fulcrum or the neutral point A as possible, so as to give the greatest energy or momentum to the cohesion. Thus if a triangular bar projecting from a wall is loaded with a weight, the strain...\nStrength of weight at its extremity, it will bear thrice as much when one of the sides is uppermost as when it is undermost. The bar of fig. 6. would be three times as strong if the side AB were uppermost and the edge DC undermost.\n\nHence it follows that the strongest joist that can be cut out of a round tree is not the one which has the greatest quantity of timber in it, but such that the product of its breadth by the square of its depth shall be the greatest possible. Let ABCD (fig. 9.) be the section of this joist inscribed in the circle, AB being the breadth and AD the depth. Since it is a rectangular section, the diagonal BD is a diameter of the circle, and BAD is a right-angled triangle. Let BD be called \\(a\\), and BA be called \\(x\\); then \\(AD = \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\\).\n\nNow we have \\(AB \\times AD\\), or \\(x \\times a^2 - x^2\\), or \\(a^2 x - x^2\\), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a>. Its fluxion \\(a^2 - 2x^2\\) must be made \\(= 0\\), or \\(a^2 = 3x^2\\), or \\(x^2 = \\frac{a^2}{3}\\). If therefore we make \\(DE = \\frac{1}{4} DB\\), and draw EC perpendicular to BD, it will cut the circumference in the point C, which determines the depth BC and the breadth CD.\n\nBecause \\(BD : BC = CD : CE\\), we have the area of the section BC-CD = BD-CE. Therefore the different sections having the same diagonal BD are proportional to their heights CE. Therefore the section BCDA is less than the section BcDa, whose four sides are equal. The joist so shaped, therefore, is both stronger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, and cheaper.\n\nThe strength of ABCD is to that of a BcD as 10,000 to 9186, and the weight and expense as 10,000 to 10,607; so that ABCD is preferable to a BcD in the proportion of 10,607 to 9186, or nearly 115 to 100.\n\nFrom the same principles it follows that a hollow tube is stronger than a solid rod containing the same quantity of matter.\n\nLet fig. 10. represent the section of a cylindrical tube, of which AF and BE are the exterior and interior diameters, and C the centre. Draw BD perpendicular to BC, and join DC. Then, because \\(BD^2 = CD^2 - CB^2\\), BD is the radius of a circle containing the same quantity of matter with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>. If we estimate the strength by the first hypothesis, it is evident that the strength of the tube will be to that of the solid cylinder, whose radius is BD, as \\(BD^4 \\times AC\\) to \\(BD^4 \\times BD\\); that is, as AC to BD: for BD expresses the cohesion of the ring or the circle, and AC and BD are equal to the distances of the centres of effort (the same with the centres of gravity) of the ring and circle from the axis of the fracture.\n\nThe proportion of these strengths will be different in the other hypotheses, and is not easily expressed by a general formula; but in both it is still more in favour of the ring or hollow tube.\n\nThe following very simple solution will be readily understood by the intelligent reader. Let O be the centre of oscillation of the exterior circle, o the centre of oscillation of the inner circle, and w the centre of oscillation of the ring included between them. Let M be the quantity of surface of the exterior circle, m that of the inner circle, and \\(f\\) that of the ring.\n\nWe have \\(Fw = \\frac{M \\cdot FO - m \\cdot Fo}{f} = \\frac{5 FC^2 + EC^2}{4FC}\\)\n\nand the strength of the ring \\(= \\frac{f \\mu \\times 1Fw}{2}\\), and the strength of the same quantity of matter in the form of a solid cylinder is \\(f \\mu \\times \\frac{3}{8} BD\\); so that the strength of the ring is to that of the solid rod of equal weight as \\(Fw\\) to \\(\\frac{3}{4} BD\\), or nearly as FC to BD. This will easily appear by recollecting that \\(FO = \\frac{\\text{sum of } p \\cdot r^2}{m \\cdot FC}\\) (see Rotation), and that the momentum of cohesion is \\(\\frac{f \\mu \\cdot FC \\cdot Ca}{2 FC} = \\frac{f \\mu \\cdot Fo}{2}\\) for the inner circle, &c.\n\nEmerson has given a very inaccurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to this value in his Mechanics, &c.\n\nThis property of hollow tubes is accompanied also and more with greater stiffness; and the superiority in strength and stiffness is so much the greater as the surrounding shell is thinner in proportion to its diameter.\n\nHere we see the admirable wisdom of the Author of Nature in forming the bones of animal limbs hollow. The wisdom of God in bones of the arms and legs have to perform the office of levers, and are thus opposed to very great transverse forces, &c., strains. By this form they become incomparably stronger and stiffer, and give more room for the insertion of muscles, while they are lighter and therefore more agile; and the same Wisdom has made use of this hollow for other valuable purposes of the animal economy. In like manner the quills in the wings of birds acquire by their thinness the very great strength which is necessary, while they are so light as to give sufficient buoyancy to the animal in the rare medium in which it must live and fly about. The stalks of many plants, such as all the grasses, and many reeds, are in like manner hollow, and thus possess an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> strength. Our best engineers now begin to imitate nature by making many parts of their machines hollow, such as their axes of cast iron, &c.; and the ingenious Mr Ramden now makes the axes and framings of his great astronomical instruments in the same manner.\n\nIn the supposition of homogeneous texture, it is plain that the fracture happens as soon as the particles at D are separated beyond their utmost limit of cohesion. This is a determined quantity, and the piece bends till this degree of extension is produced in the outermost fibre. It follows, that the smaller we suppose the distance between A and D, the greater will be the curvature which the beam will acquire before it breaks. Greater depth therefore makes a beam not only stronger but also stiffer. But if the parallel fibres can slide on each other, both the strength and the stiffness will be diminished. Therefore if, instead of one beam DA KC Fig. 8. (fig. 8.) we suppose two, DABC and ADKB, not cohering, how each of them will bend, and the extension of the fibres strong AB of the under beam will not hinder the compression compound of the adjoining fibres AB of the upper beam. The beam may two together therefore will not be more than twice as be formed, strong as one of them (supposing DA = A D) instead of being four times as strong; and they will bend as much as either of them alone would bend by half the load. This may be prevented, if it were possible to unite the two beams all along the seam AB, so that the one shall not slide on the other. This may be done in small works, by gluing them together with a cement as strong as the natural lateral cohesion of the fibres. If this cannot be done (as it cannot in large works), the sliding is prevented by joggling the beams together; that is, by cutting down several rectangular notches in the upper side of the lower beam, and making similar notches in\nStrength of in the under side of the upper beam, and filling up the square spaces with pieces of very hard wood firmly driven in, as represented in fig. 11. Some employ iron bolts by way of joggles. But when the joggle is much harder than the wood into which it is driven, it is very apt to work loose, by widening the hole into which it is lodged. The same thing is sometimes done by scarfing the one upon the other, as represented in fig. 12.; but this wastes more timber, and is not so strong, because the mutual hooks which this method forms on each beam are very apt to tear each other up. By one or other of these methods, or something similar, may a compound beam be formed, of any depth, which will be almost as stiff and strong as an entire piece.\n\nOn the other hand, we may combine strength with pliability, by composing our beam of several thin planks laid on each other, till they make a proper depth, and leaving them at full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to slide on each other. It is in this manner that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>-springs are formed, as is represented in fig. 13. In this assemblage there must be no joggles nor bolts of any kind put through the planks or plates; for this would hinder their mutual sliding. They must be kept together by straps which surround them, or by something equivalent.\n\nThe preceding observations show the propriety of some maxims of construction, which the artists have derived from long experience.\n\nThus, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTISE\">mortise</a> is to be cut out of a piece which is exposed to a cross strain, it should be cut out from that side which becomes concave by the strain, as in fig. 14., but by no means as in fig. 15.\n\nIf a piece is to be strengthened by the addition of another, the added piece must be joined to the side which grows convex by the strain, as in fig. 16. and 17.\n\nBefore we go any farther, it will be convenient to recall the reader's attention to the analogy between the strain on a beam projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and a beam supported at both ends and loaded in some intermediate point. It is sufficient on this occasion to read attentively what is delivered in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">Roof</a>, No. 19.\u2014We learn there that the strain on the middle point C (fig. 17. of the present article) of a rectangular beam AB, supported on props at A and B, is the same as if the part CA projected from a wall, and were loaded with the half of the weight W suspended at A. The momentum of the strain is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} W \\times \\frac{1}{2} AB = W \\times \\frac{1}{2} AB = \\rho \\frac{1}{2} l$, or $\\rho \\frac{l}{4}$. The momentum of cohesion must be equal to this in every hypothesis.\n\nHaving now considered in sufficient detail the circumstances which affect the strength of any section of a solid body that is strained transversely, it is necessary to take notice of some of the chief modifications of the strain itself. We shall consider only those that occur most frequently in our constructions.\n\nThe strain depends on the external force, and also on the lever by which it acts.\n\nIt is evidently of importance, that since the strain is exerted in any section by means of the cohesion of the parts intervening between the section under consideration and the point of application of the external force, the body must be able in all these intervening parts to propagate or excite the strain in the remote section. In every part it must be able to resist the strain excited in that part. It should therefore be equally strong; and it is useless to have any part stronger, because the piece will nevertheless break where it is not stronger throughout; and it is useless to make it stronger (relatively to its strain) in any part, for it will nevertheless equally fail in the part that is too weak.\n\nSuppose then, in the first place, that the strain arises from a weight suspended at one extremity, while the other end is firmly fixed in a wall. Supposing also the cross sections to be all rectangular, there are several ways of shaping the beam so that it shall be equally strong throughout. Thus it may be equally deep in every part, the upper and under surfaces being horizontal planes. The condition will be fulfilled by making all the horizontal sections triangles, as in fig. 18. The Fig. 18. two sides are vertical planes meeting in an edge at the extremity L. For the equation expressing the balance of strain and strength is $p = f/b \\cdot d^2$. Therefore since $d^2$ is the same throughout, and also $p$, we must have $f/b = l$, and $b$ (the breadth AD of any section ABCD) must be proportional to $l$ (or AL), which it evidently is.\n\nOr, if the beam be of uniform breadth, we must have $d^2$ everywhere proportional to $l$. This will be obtained by making the depths the ordinates of a common parabola, of which L is the vertex and the length is the axis. The upper or under side may be a straight line, as in fig. 19., or the middle line may be straight, and Fig. 19., then both upper and under surfaces will be curved. It is almost indifferent what is the shape of the upper and under surfaces, provided the distances between them in every part be as the ordinates of a common parabola.\n\nOr, if the sections are all similar, such as circles, squares, or any other similar polygons, we must have $d^2$ or $b^2$ proportional to $l$, and the depths or breadths must be as the ordinates of a cubical parabola.\n\nIt is evident that these are also the proper forms for And on the lever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> round a fulcrum, and acted on by a form of the force at the extremity. The force comes in the place levers by of the weight suspended in the cases already considered; acts, and as such levers always are connected with another arm, we readily see that both arms should be fashioned in the same manner. Thus in fig. 18. the piece of timber may be supposed a kind of steelyard, moveable round a horizontal axis OP, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the wall, and having the two weights P and X in equilibrium. The strain occasioned by each at the section in which the axis OP is placed must be the same, and each arm OL and OA must be equally strong in all its parts. The longitudinal sections of each arm must be a triangle, a common parabola, or a cubic parabola, according to the conditions previously given.\n\nAnd, moreover, all these forms are equally strong: For any one of them is equally strong in all its parts, and they are all supposed to have the same section at the front of the wall or at the fulcrum. They are not, however, equally stiff. The first, represented in fig. 18., will bend least upon the whole, and the one formed by the cubic parabola will bend most. But their curvature at the very fulcrum will be the same in all.\n\nIt is also plain, that if the lever is of the second or third kind, that is, having the fulcrum at one extremity, it must still be of the same shape; for in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> mechanics it is indifferent which of the three points is considered as the axis of motion. In every lever the\nStrength of two forces at the extremities act in one direction, and the force in the middle acts in the opposite direction, and the great strain is always at that point. Therefore a lever such as fig. 18, moveable round an axis passing horizontally through A, and acting against an obstacle at OP, is equally able in all its parts to resist the strains excited in those parts.\n\nThe same principles and the same construction will apply to beams, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOISTS\">joists</a>, supported at the ends L and A (fig. 18.), and loaded at some intermediate part OP. This will appear evident by merely inverting the directions of the forces at these three points, or by recurring to the article ROOF, No. 19.\n\nHitherto we have supposed the external straining force as acting only in one point of the beam. But it may be uniformly distributed all over the beam. To make a beam in such circumstances equally strong in all its parts, the shape must be considerably different from the former.\n\nThus suppose the beam to project from a wall. If it be of equal breadth throughout, its sides being vertical planes parallel to each other and to the length, the vertical section in the direction of its length must be a triangle instead of a common parabola; for the weight uniformly distributed over the part lying beyond any section, is as the length beyond that section: and since it may all be conceived as collected at its centre of gravity, which is the middle of that length, the lever by which this load acts or strains the section is also proportional to the same length. The strain on the section (or momentum of the load) is as the square of that length. The section must have strength in the same proportion. Its strength being as the breadth and the square of the depth, and the breadth being constant, the square of the depth of any section must be as the square of its distance from the end, and the depth must be as that distance; and therefore the longitudinal vertical section must be a triangle.\n\nBut if all the transverse sections are circles, squares, or any other similar figures, the strength of every section, or the cube of the diameter, must be as the square of the lengths beyond that section, or the square of its distance from the end; and the sides of the beam must be a semicubical parabola.\n\nIf the upper and under surfaces are horizontal planes, it is evident that the breadth must be as the square of the distance from the end, and the horizontal sections may be formed by arches of the common parabola, having the length for their tangent at the vertex.\n\nBy recurring to the analogy so often quoted between a projecting beam and a joist, we may determine the proper form of joists which are uniformly loaded through their whole length.\n\nThis is a frequent and important case, being the office of joists, rafters, &c.; and there are some circumstances which must be particularly noticed, because they are not so obvious, and have been misunderstood. When a beam AB (fig. 20.) is supported at the ends, and a weight is laid on any point P, a strain is excited in every part of the beam. The load on P causes the beam to press on A and B, and the props react with forces equal and opposite to these pressures. The load at P is to the pressures at A and B as AB to PB and PA, and the pressure at A is to that at B as PB to PA; the beam therefore is in the same state, with respect to strain in every part of it, as if it were resting Strength of on a prop at P, and were loaded at the ends with weights equal to the two pressures on the props: and observe, these pressures are such as will balance each other, being inversely as their distances from P. Let P represent the weight or load at P. The pressure on the prop P must be \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\). This is therefore the reaction of the prop B, and is the weight which we may suppose suspended at B, when we conceive the beam relling on a prop at P, and carrying the balancing weights at A and B.\n\nThe strain occasioned at any other point C, by the load P at P, is the same with the strain at C, by the weight \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\) hanging at B, when the beam rests on P, in the manner now supposed; and it is the same if the beam, instead of being balanced on a prop at P, had its part AP fixed in a wall. This is evident. Now we have shown at length that the strain at C, by the weight \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\) hanging at B, is \\( \\frac{PA}{AB} \\times BC \\). We define it to be particularly remarked that the pressure at A has no influence on the strain at C, arising from the action of any load between A and C; for it is indifferent how the part AP of the projecting beam PB is supported. The weight at A just performs the same office with the wall in which we suppose the beam to be fixed. We are thus particular, because we have seen even persons not unaccustomed to discussions of this kind puzzled in their conceptions of this strain.\n\nNow let the load P be laid on some point p between C and B. The same reasoning shows us that the point is (with respect to strain) in the same state as if the beam were fixed in a wall, embracing the part pB, and a weight \\( \\frac{pB}{AB} \\) were hung on at A, and the strain at C is \\( \\frac{pB}{AB} \\times AC \\).\n\nIn general, therefore, the strain on any point C, arising from a load P laid on another point P, is proportional to the rectangle of the distances of P and C from the ends nearest to each. It is \\( \\frac{PA \\times CB}{AB} \\), or \\( \\frac{pB \\times CA}{AB} \\), according as the load lies between C and A or between C and B.\n\nCor. 1. The strains which a load on any point P occasions on the points C, c, lying on the same side of P, are as the distances of these points from the end B. In like manner the strains on E and e are as EA and eA.\n\nCor. 2. The strain which a load occasions in the part on which it rests is as the rectangle of the parts on each side. Thus the strain occasioned at C by a load is to that at D by the same load as AC \\(\\times\\) CB to AD \\(\\times\\) DB. It is therefore greatest in the middle.\n\nLet us now consider the strain on any point C arising from a load uniformly distributed along the beam. Letting AP be represented by x, and PB by y, and the whole distributed weight on the beam by a. Then\n\nThe weight on PP is \\( = a \\times \\frac{x}{AB} \\).\nPressure on B by the weight on \\( P \\rho = a \\times \\frac{AB}{\\sqrt{AB}} \\)\n\nOr \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^2}{AB^4} \\).\n\nPressure on B by whole wt. on AC \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^3 \\times BC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nStrain at C by the weight on AC \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^2 \\times BC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nStrain at C by the weight on BC \\( = a \\times \\frac{BC^2 \\times AC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nDw by whole weight on AB \\( = a \\times \\frac{AC^2 \\times BC + BC^2 \\times AC}{2AB^2} \\),\n\n\\( = a \\times \\frac{AC \\times BC \\times AC + CB}{2AB^2} \\),\n\n\\( = a \\times \\frac{AC \\times BC}{2AB^2} \\).\n\nThus we see that the strain is proportional to the rectangle of the parts, in the same manner as if the load \\( a \\) had been laid directly on the point C, and is indeed equal to one-half of the strain which would be produced at C by the load \\( a \\) laid on there.\n\nIt was necessary to be thus particular, because we see in some elementary treatises of mechanics, published by authors of reputation, mistakes which are very plausible, and mislead the learner. It is there said, that the pressure at B from a weight uniformly diffused along AB is the same as if it were collected at its centre of gravity, which would be the middle of AB; and then the strain at C is said to be this pressure at B multiplied by BC. But surely it is not difficult to see the difference of these strains. It is plain that the pressure of gravity downwards on any point between the end A and the point C has no tendency to diminish the strain at C, arising from the upward reaction of the prop B; whereas the pressure of gravity between C and B is almost in direct opposition to it, and must diminish it. We may however avoid the fluxionary calculus with safety by the consideration of the centre of gravity, by supposing the weights of AC and BC to be collected at their respective centres of gravity; and the result of this computation will be the same as above; and we may use either method, although the weight is not uniformly distributed, provided only that we know in what manner it is distributed.\n\nThis investigation is evidently of importance in the practice of the engineer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, informing them what support is necessary in the different parts of their constructions. We considered some cases of this kind in the article Roofs.\n\nIt is now easy to form a joint, so that it shall have the same relative strength in all its parts.\n\n1. To make it equally able in all its parts to carry a given weight laid on any point C taken at random, or uniformly diffused over the whole length, the strength of the section at the point C must be as AC \\(\\times\\) CB.\n\nTherefore\n\n1. If the sides are parallel vertical planes, the square of the depth (which is the only variable dimension) or CD\\(^2\\), must be as AC \\(\\times\\) CB, and the depths must be ordinates of an ellipse.\n\n2. If the transverse sections are similar, we must make CD\\(^3\\) as AC \\(\\times\\) CB.\n\n3. If the upper and under surfaces are parallel, the breadth must be as AC \\(\\times\\) CB.\n\nII. If the beam is necessarily loaded at some given point C, and we would have the beam equally able in all its parts to resist the strain arising from the weight at C, we must make the strength of every transverse section between C and either end as its distance from that end. Therefore\n\n1. If the sides are parallel vertical planes, we must make CD\\(^3\\) : EF\\(^3\\) = AC : AE.\n\n2. If the sections are similar, then CD\\(^3\\) : EF\\(^3\\) = AC : AE.\n\n3. If the upper and under surfaces are parallel, then, breadth at C : breadth at E = AC : AE.\n\nThe same principles enable us to determine the strain and strength of square or circular plates, of different extent, but equal thicknesses. This may be comprehended in this general proposition.\n\nSimilar plates of equal thickness supported all round will carry the same absolute weight, uniformly distributed, or resting on similar points, whatever is their extent, but of equal thicknesses.\n\nSuppose two similar oblong plates of equal thicknesses, L, l, and B, b, let their lengths and breadths be L, l, and B, b, determined by their strength or momentum of cohesion be C, c, and the strains from the weights W, w, be S, s.\n\nSuppose the plates supported at the ends only, and resisting fracture transversely. The strains, being as the weights and lengths, are as WL and w l, but their cohesions are as the breadths; and since they are of equal relative strength, we have WL : w l = B : b, and WLb = w l B and L : l = w B : W b; but since they are of similar shapes L : l = B : b, and therefore w = W.\n\nThe same reasoning holds again when they are also supported along the sides, and therefore holds when they are supported all round (in which case the strength is doubled).\n\nAnd if the plates are of any other figure, such as circles or ellipses, we need only conceive similar rectangles inscribed in them. These are supported all around by the continuity of the plates, and therefore will sustain equal weights; and the same may be said of the segments which lie without them, because the strengths of any similar segments are equal, their lengths being as their breadths.\n\nTherefore the thickness of the bottoms of vessels holding heavy liquors or grains should be as their diameters, and as the square root of their depths jointly.\n\nAlso the weight which a square plate will bear is to that which a bar of the same matter and thickness will bear as twice the length of the bar to its breadth.\n\nThere is yet another modification of the strain which tends to break a body transversely, which is of very frequent occurrence, and in some cases must be very carefully attended to, viz. the strain arising from its own weight.\n\nWhen a beam projects from a wall, every section is strained by the weight of all that projects beyond it. This may be considered as all collected at its centre of gravity. Therefore the strain on any section is in the joint ratio of the weight of what projects beyond it, and the distance of its centre of gravity from the section.\n\nThe determination of this strain and of the strength necessary for withstanding it must be more complicated than the former, because the form of the piece which results from this adjustment of strain and strength influ-\nThe general principle must evidently be, that the strength or momentum of cohesion of every section must be as the product of the weight beyond it multiplied by the distance of its centre of gravity. For example:\n\nSuppose the beam DLA (fig. 21.) to project from the wall, and that its sides are parallel vertical planes, so that the depth is the only variable dimension. Let \\( LB = x \\) and \\( Bb = y \\). The element \\( BbC \\) is \\( yx \\).\n\nLet \\( G \\) be the centre of gravity of the part lying without \\( Bb \\), and \\( g \\) be its distance from the extremity \\( L \\). Then \\( x - g \\) is the arm of the lever by which the strain is excited in the section \\( Bb \\). Let \\( Bb \\) or \\( y \\) be some power \\( m \\) of \\( LB \\); that is, let \\( y = xm \\). Then the contents of \\( LBb \\) is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\). The momentum of gravity round a horizontal axis at \\( L \\) is \\( yx = \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\), and the whole momentum round the axis is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\). The distance of the centre of gravity from \\( L \\) is had by dividing this momentum by the whole weight which is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> or \\( g \\) is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\). And the distance of the centre of gravity from the section \\( Bb \\) is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\).\n\nTherefore the strain on the section \\( Bb \\) is had by multiplying \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\) by \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\). The product is \\( \\frac{xm+1}{m+2} \\times \\frac{xm+1}{m+1} \\). This must be as the square of the depth, or as \\( y^2 \\). But \\( y \\) is as \\( xm \\), and \\( y^2 \\) as \\( x^2m \\). Therefore we have \\( m + 2 = 2m \\), and \\( m = 2 \\); that is, the depth must be as the square of the distance from the extremity, and the curve \\( LbA \\) is a parabola touching the horizontal line in \\( L \\).\n\nIt is easy to see that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONOID\">conoid</a> formed by the rotation of this figure round \\( DL \\) will also be equally able in every section to bear its own weight.\n\nWe need not prosecute this farther. When the figure of the piece is given, there is no difficulty in finding the strain; and the circumstance of equal strength to resist this strain is chiefly a matter of curiosity.\n\nIt is evident, from what has been already said, that a projecting beam becomes less able to bear its own weight, as it projects farther. Whatever may be the strength of the section \\( DA \\), the length may be such that it will break by its own weight. If we suppose two beams \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) of the same substance and similar shapes, that is, having their lengths and diameters in the same proportion; and farther suppose that the shorter can just bear its own weight; then the longer beam will not be able to do the same: For the strengths of the sections are as the cubes of the diameters, while the strains are as the biquadrates of the diameters; because the weights are as the cubes, and the levers by which these weights act in producing the strain are as the lengths or as the diameters.\n\nThese considerations show us, that in all cases where strain is affected by the weight of the parts of the machine or structure of any kind, the smaller bodies are more able to withstand it than the greater; and therefore seems to be bounds set by nature to the size of machines constructed of any given materials. Even when the weight of the parts of the machine is not taken into account, we cannot enlarge them in the same proportion as more in all their parts. Thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine cannot be doubled able to in all its parts, so as to be still efficient. The pressure on the piston is quadrupled. If the lift of the pump be also produced doubled in height while it is doubled in diameter, then the load will be increased eight times, and will therefore exceed the power. The depth of lift, therefore, must remain unchanged; and in this case the machine will be of the same relative strength as before, independent of its own weight. For the beam being doubled in all its dimensions, its momentum of cohesion is eight times greater, which is again a balance for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> load acting by a double lever.\u2014But if we now consider the increase of the weight of the machine itself, which must be supported, and which must be put in motion by the intervention of its cohesion, we see that the large machine is weaker and less efficient than the small one.\n\nThere is a similar limit set by nature to the size of plants and animals formed of the same matter. The cohesion of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a> could not support it if it were increased to the size of a tree, nor could an oak support itself if 40 or 50 times bigger, nor could an animal of the make of a long-legged spider be increased to the size of a man; the articulations of its legs could not support it.\n\nHence may be understood the prodigious superiority even of the small animals both in strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGILITY\">agility</a>. Animals are man by falling twice his own height may break his firm bones. A mouse may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> 20 times its height without risk; and even the tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITE\">mite</a> or wood-louse may fall unhurt from the top of a steeple. But their greatest superiority is in respect of nimbleness and agility. A flea can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> above 500 times its own length, while the strength of the human muscles could not raise the trunk from the ground on limbs of the same construction.\n\nThe angular motions of small animals (in which consists their nimbleness or agility) must be greater than those of large animals, supposing the force of the muscular fibre to be the same in both. For supposing them similar, the number of equal fibres will be as the square of their linear dimensions; and the levers by which they act are as their linear dimensions. The energy therefore of the moving force is as the cube of these dimensions. But the momentum of inertia, or \\( \\int p \\cdot r^3 \\), is as the 4th power: Therefore the angular velocity of the greater animals is smaller. The number of strokes which a fly makes with its wings in a second is astonishingly great; yet, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a>, they are the effects of its agility.\n\nWe have hitherto confined our attention to the simplest form in which this transverse strain can be produced. This was quite sufficient for showing us the mechanism of nature by which the strain is resisted; and a very slight attention is sufficient for enabling us to reduce to this every other way in which the strain can be produced. We shall not take up the reader's time with the application of the same principles to other cases of this strain, but refer him to what has been said in the article ROOF. In that article we have shown the analogy between the strain on the section of a beam projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and the strain...\nStrength of strain on the same section of a beam simply resting on supports at the ends, and loaded at some intermediate point or points. The strain on the middle C of a beam AB (fig. 22.) so supported, arising from a weight laid there, is the same with the strain which half that weight hanging at B would produce on the same section C if the other end of the beam were fixed in a wall. If therefore 1000 pounds hung on the end of a beam projecting 10 feet from a wall will just break it at the wall, it will require 4000 pounds on its middle to break the same beam resting on two props 10 feet asunder. We have also shown in that article the additional strength which will be given to this beam by extending both ends beyond the props, and there framing it firmly into other pillars or supports. We can hardly add anything to what has been said in that article, except a few observations on the effects of the obliquity of the external force. We have hitherto supposed it to act in the direction BP (fig. 8.) perpendicular to the length of the beam. Suppose it to act in the direction BP', oblique to BA. In the article Roofs we supposed the strain to be the same as if the force p acted at the distance AB'; but still perpendicular to AB; so it is. But the strength of the section AD is not the same in both cases; for by the obliquity of the action the piece DCKA is preffed to the other. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the corpufcular forces to say precisely what will be the effect of the pressure arising from this obliquity; but we can clearly see, in general, that the point A, which in the instant of fracture is neither stretched nor comprifhed, must now be farther up, or nearer to D; and therefore the number of particles which are exerting cohesive forces is smaller, and therefore the strength is diminished. Therefore, when we endeavour to proportion the strength of a beam to the strain arising from an external force acting obliquely, we make too liberal allowance by increasing this external force in the ratio of AB to AB'. We acknowledge our inability to affign the proper correction. But this circumstance is of very great influence. In many machines, and many framings of carpentry, this oblique action of the straining force is unavoidable; and the most enormous strains to which materials are exposed are generally of this kind. In the frames set up for carrying the ringstones of arches, it is hardly possible to avoid them: for although the judicious engineer difposes his beams so as to sustain only pressures in the direction of their lengths, tending either to crush them or to tear them asunder, it frequently happens that, by the settling of the work, the pieces come to check and bear on each other transversely, tending to break each other across. This we have remarked upon in the article Roofs, with respect to a truss by Mr Price (see Roofs, No. 40, 41, 45). Now when a cross strain is thus combined with an enormous pressure in the direction of the length of the beam, it is in the utmost danger of snapping suddenly across. This is one great cause of the carrying away of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>. They are comprifhed in the direction of their length by the united force of the shrouds, and in this state the transverse action of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> soon completes the fracture.\n\nWhen considering the compressing strains to which columns are exposed, we deferred the discussion of the strain on columns, observing that it was not, in the cases which usually occur, a simple compression, but was combined with a transverse strain, arising from the bending of the column. When the column ACB (fig. 23.) rests on the ground at B, and loaded at top with a weight A, acting in the vertical direction AB, is bent into a curve ACB, so that the tangent at C is perpendicular to the horizon, its condition somewhat resembles that of a beam firmly fixed between B and C, and strongly pulled by the end A, so as to bend it between C and A. Although we cannot conceive how a force acting on a straight column AB in the direction AB can bend it, we may suppose that the force acted first in the horizontal direction Ab till it was bent to this degree, and that the rope was then gradually removed from the direction Ab to the direction AB, increasing the force as much as is necessary for preserving the same quantity of flexure.\n\nThe first author (we believe) who considered this important subject with scrupulous attention was the celebrated Euler, who published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Memoirs for 1757 his Theory of the Strength of Columns. The strength of general proposition established by this theory is, that the strength of prismatical columns is in the direct quadruplicate ratio of their diameters, and the inverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> ratio of their lengths. He prosecuted this subject in the Peterburgh Commentaries for 1778, confirming his former theory. We do not find that any other author has bestowed much attention on it, all seeming to acquiesce in the determinations of Euler, and to consider the subject as of very great difficulty, requiring the application of the most refined mathematics. Mulchenbroek has compared the theory with experiment; but the comparison has been very unsatisfactory, the difference from the theory being so enormous as to afford no argument for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>. But the experiments do not contradict it, for they are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANOMALOUS\">anomalous</a> as to afford no conclusion or general rule whatever.\n\nTo say the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, the theory can be considered in no other light than as a specimen of ingenious and very artful algebraic analysis. Euler was unquestionably the first analyst in Europe for resource and address. He knew this, and enjoyed his superiority, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> admitted any physical assumptions which gave him an opportunity of displaying his skill. The insufficiency of his assumptions with the known laws of mechanism gave him no concern; and when his algebraic processes led him to any conclusion which would make his readers stare, being contrary to all our usual notions, he frankly owned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, but went on in his analysis, saying, \"Sed analysi magis fidendum.\" Mr Robins has given some very rife instances of this confidence in his analysis, or rather of his confidence in the indolent submission of his readers. Nay, so fond was he of this kind of amusement, that after having published an untenable Theory of Light and Colours, he published several Memoirs, explaining the aberration of the heavenly bodies, and deducing some very wonderful consequences, fully confirmed by experience, from the Newtonian principles, which were opposite and totally inconsistent with his own theory, merely because the Newtonian theory gave him \"occasionem analyseos promovendi.\" We are thus severe in our observations, because his theory of the strength of columns is one of the strongest instances of this wanton kind of proceeding, and because his followers in the Academy of St Peterburgh, such as Mr Fuss, Lexell, and others, adopt his conclusions, and merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> his words. Since the death of Daniel Bernoulli\nStrength of Bernoulli no member of that academy has controverted any thing advanced by their Professor jubilis geometriae, to whom they had been indebted for their places and for all their knowledge, having been (most of them) his amanuenses, employed by this wonderful man during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a> to make his computations and carry on his algebraic investigations. We are not a little surprised to see Mr Emeron, a considerable mathematician, and a man of very independent spirit, hastily adopting the same theory, of which we doubt not but our readers will easily see the fallacy.\n\nEuler considers the column ACB as in a condition precisely similar to that of an elastic rod bent into the curve by a cord AB connecting its extremities.\u2014In this he is not mistaken.\u2014But he then draws CD perpendicular to AB, and considers the strain on the section C as equal to the momentum or mechanical energy of the weight A acting in the direction DB upon the lever zcD, moveable round the fulcrum c, and tending to tear asunder the particles which cohere along the section cCz. This is the same principle (as Euler admits) employed by James Bernoulli in his investigation of the elastic curve ACB. Euler considers the strain on the section c as the same with what it would sustain if the same power acted in the horizontal direction EF on a point E as far removed from C as the point D is. We reasoned in the same manner (as has been observed) in the article Roofs, where the obliquity of action was inconsiderable. But in the present case, this substitution leads to the greatest mistakes, and has rendered the whole of this theory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> and useless. It would be just if the column were of materials which are incompreensible. But it is evident, by what has been said above, that by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of the parts the real fulcrum of the lever shifts away from the point c, so much the more as the comprehension is greater. In the great comprehensions of loaded columns, and the almost unmeasurable comprehensions of the truss beams in the centres of bridges, and other cases of chief importance, the fulcrum is shifted far over towards x, so that very few fibres resist the fracture by their cohesion; and these few have a very feeble energy or momentum, on account of the short arm of the lever by which they act. This is a most important consideration in carpentry, yet makes no element of Euler's theory. The consequence of this is, that a very small degree of curvature is sufficient to cause the column or strut to snap in an instant, as is well known to every experienced carpenter. The experiment by Muffenbrock, which Euler makes use of in order to obtain a measure of strength in a particular instance, from which he might deduce all others by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>, is an incontestable proof of this. The force which broke the column is not the twentieth part of what is necessary for breaking it by acting at E in the direction EF. Euler takes no notice of this immense discrepancy, because it must have caused him to abandon the speculation with which he was then amusing himself.\n\nThe limits of this work do not afford room to enter minutely upon the refutation of this theory; but we can easily show its uselessness, by its total inconsistency with common observation. It results legitimately from this theory, that if CD have no magnitude, the weight A can have no momentum, and the column cannot be broken\u2014True,\u2014it cannot be broken in this way, snapped by a transverse fracture, if it do not bend; but we know very well that it can be crushed or crippled, and we see this frequently happen. This circumstance or event does not enter into Euler's investigation, and therefore the theory is imperfect at least and useless. Had this crippling been introduced in the form of a physical assumption, every topic of reasoning employed in the process must have been laid aside, as the intelligent reader will easily see. But the theory is not only imperfect, but false. The ordinary reader will be convinced of this by another legitimate consequence of it. Fig. 24. is the same Fig. 24., with fig. 106 of Emeron's Mechanics, where this subject is treated on Euler's principles, and represents a crooked piece of matter resting on the ground at F, and loaded at A with a weight acting in the vertical direction AF. It results from Euler's theory that the strains at b, B, D, E, &c. are as b, BC, DI, EK, &c. Therefore the strains at G and H are nothing; and this is affirmed by Emeron and Euler as a serious truth; and the piece may be thinned ad infinitum in these two places, or even cut through, without any diminution of its strength. The absurdity of this assertion strikes at first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>. Euler affirms the same thing with respect to a point of contrary flexure. Farther discussion is (we apprehend) needless.\n\nThis theory must therefore be given up. Yet these Yet Euler's dissertations of Euler in the Peterburgh Commentaries deserve a perusal, both as very ingenious specimens of analysis, and because they contain maxims of practice which are important. Although they give an erroneous measure of the comparative strength of columns, they show the immense importance of preventing all bendings, and point out with accuracy where the tendencies to bend are greatest, and how this may be prevented by very small forces, and what a prodigious accession of force this gives the column. There is a valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in the same volume by Fuls on the Strains on framed Carpentry, which may also be read with advantage.\n\nIt will now be asked, what shall be substituted in place of this erroneous theory? what is the true proportion of the strength of columns? We acknowledge our inability to give a satisfactory answer. Such can be obtained only by a previous knowledge of the proportion between the extensions and comprehensions produced by equal forces, by the knowledge of the absolute comprehensions producible by a given force, and by a knowledge of the degree of that derangement of parts which is termed crip-pling. These circumstances are but imperfectly known to us, and there lies before us a wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of experimental inquiry. Fortunately the force requisite for crippling a beam is prodigious, and a very small lateral support is sufficient to prevent that bending which puts the beam in imminent danger. A judicious engineer will always employ transverse bristles, as they are called, to stay the middle of long beams, which are employed as pillars, struts, or truss beams, and are exposed, by their position, to enormous pressures in the direction of their lengths. Such stays may be observed, disposed with great judgement and economy, in the centres employed by Mr Perronet in the erection of his great stone arches. He was obliged to correct this omission made by his ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> in the beautiful centres of the bridge of Orleans, which we have no hesitation in affirming to be the finest piece of carpentry in the world.\nIt only remains on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to compare these theoretical deductions with experiment.\n\nExperiments on the transverse strength of bodies are easily made, and accordingly are very numerous, especially those made on timber, which is the case most common and most interesting. But in this great number of experiments there are very few from which we can draw much practical information. The experiments have in general been made on such small scantlings, that the unavoidable natural inequalities bear too great a proportion to the strength of the whole piece. Accordingly, when we compare the experiments of different authors, we find them differ enormously, and even the experiments by the same author are very anomalous. The completest series that we have yet seen is that detailed by Belidor in his *Science des Ingenieurs*. They are contained in the following table. The pieces were found, even-grained oak. The column \\( b \\) contains the breadths of the pieces in inches; the column \\( d \\) contains their depths; the column \\( l \\) contains their lengths; column \\( p \\) contains the weights (in pounds) which broke them when hung on their middles; and \\( m \\) is the column of averages or mediums.\n\n| No | b | d | l | p | m |\n|----|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1  | 1 | 18| 400| 406| 405|\n| 2  | 1 | 18| 600| 608| 624|\n| 3  | 2 | 18| 795| 805| 812|\n| 4  | 1 | 18| 1570| 1580| 1590|\n| 5  | 1 | 36| 185| 195| 187|\n| 6  | 1 | 36| 285| 280| 283|\n| 7  | 2 | 36| 1550| 1585| 1585|\n| 8  | 2 | 36| 1665| 1660| 1640|\n\nThe ends lying loose.\n\nThe ends firmly fixed.\n\nLoose.\n\nFixed.\n\nLoose.\n\nBy comparing Experiments 1st and 3d, the strength appears proportional to the breadth.\n\nExperiments 3d and 4th shew the strength proportional to the square of the depth.\n\nExperiments 1st and 5th shew the strength nearly in the inverse proportion of the lengths, but with a sensible deficiency in the longer pieces.\n\nExperiments 5th and 7th shew the strengths proportional to the breadths and the square of the depth.\n\nExperiments 1st and 7th shew the same thing, compounded with the inverse proportion of the length: the deficiency relative to the length is not so remarkable here.\n\nExperiments 1st and 2d, and experiments 5th and 6th shew the increase of strength, by fastening the ends, to be in the proportion of 2 to 3. The theory gives the proportion of 2 to 4. But a difference in the manner of fixing may produce this deviation from the theory, which only supposed them to be held down at places beyond the props, as when a joist is held in the walls, and also rests on two pillars between the walls. (See what is said on this subject in the article Roof, \u00a7 19.) where note, that there is a mistake, when it is said that a beam supported at both ends and loaded in the middle, will carry twice as much as if one end were fixed in the wall and the weight suspended at the other end. The reasoning employed there shows that it will carry four times as much.\n\nThe chief source of irregularity in such experiments is the fibrous, or rather plated texture of timber. It consists of annual additions, whose cohesion with each other is vastly weaker than that of their own fibres. Let fig. 25 represent the section of a tree, and ABCD, Fig. 25, \\( a b c d \\) the section of two battens that are to be cut out of it for experiment, and let AD and \\( a d \\) be the depths, and DC, \\( d c \\) the breadths. The batten ABCD will be the strongest, for the same reason that an assemblage of planks set edgewise will form a stronger joist than planks laid above each other like the plates of a coach-spring. M. Buffon found by many trials that the strength of ABCD was to that of \\( a b c d \\) (in oak) nearly as 8 to 7. The authors of the different experiments were not careful that their battens had their plates all disposed similarly with respect to the strain. But even with this precaution they would not have afforded sure grounds of computation for large works; for great beams occupy much, if not the whole, of the section of the tree; and from this it has happened that their strength is less than in proportion to that of a small lath or batten. In short, we can trust no experiments but such as have been made on large beams. These must be very rare, for they are most expensive and laborious, and exceed the abilities of most of those who are disposed to study this matter.\n\nBut we are not wholly without such authority. M. Buffon and M. Du Hamel, two of the first philosophers and mechanicians of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, were directed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to make experiments on this subject, and were supplied with ample funds and apparatus. The relation of their experiments is to be found in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1740, 1741, 1742, 1768; as also in Du Hamel's valuable performances sur l'Exploitation des Arbres, et sur la Conservation et le Transport de Bois. We earnestly recommend these dissertations to the perusal of our readers, as containing much useful information relative to the strength of timber, and the best methods of employing it. We shall here give an abstract of M. Buffon's experiments.\nHe relates a great number which he had prosecuted during two years on small battens. He found that the odds of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYER\">layer</a>, or part of a layer, more or less, or even a different disposition of them, had such influence that he was obliged to abandon this method, and to have recourse to the largest beams that he was able to break. The following table exhibits one series of experiments on bars of sound oak, clear of knots, and four inches square. This is a specimen of all the rest.\n\nColumn 1st is the length of the bar in clear feet between the supports.\n\nColumn 2d is the weight of the bar (the 2d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after it was felled) in pounds. Two bars were tried of each length. Each of the first three pairs consisted of two cuts of the same tree. The one next the root was always found the heaviest, stiffest, and strongest. Indeed Mr. Buffon says that this was invariably true, that the heaviest was always the strongest; and he recommends it as certain (or sure) rule for the choice of timber. He finds that this is always the case when the timber has grown vigorously, forming very thick annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>. But he also observes that this is only during the advances of the tree to maturity; for the strength of the different circles approaches gradually to equality during the tree's healthy growth, and then it decays in these parts in a contrary order. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOOL\">tool</a>-makers assert the same thing with respect to beech; yet a contrary opinion is very prevalent; and wood with a fine, that is, a small grain, is frequently preferred. Perhaps no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> has ever made the trial with such minuteness as Mr. Buffon, and we think that much deference is due to his opinion.\n\nColumn 3d is the number of pounds necessary for breaking the tree in the course of a few minutes.\n\nColumn 4th is the inches which it bent down before breaking.\n\nColumn 5th is the time at which it broke.\n\n|   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |\n|---|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 7 | 60 | 5350 | 3-5 | 29 |\n|   | 56 | 5275 | 4-5 | 22 |\n| 8 | 68 | 4600 | 3-75 | 15 |\n|   | 63 | 4500 | 4-7 | 13 |\n| 9 | 77 | 4100 | 4-85 | 14 |\n|   | 71 | 3950 | 5-5 | 12 |\n| 10| 84 | 3625 | 5-83 | 15 |\n|   | 82 | 3600 | 6-5 | 15 |\n| 12| 100 | 3050 | 7. |\n\nThe experiments on other sizes were made in the same way. A pair at least of each length and size was taken. The mean results are contained in the following table. The beams were all square, and their sizes in inches are placed at the head of the columns, and their lengths in feet are in the first column.\n\nM. Buffon had found by numerous trials that oak-timber lost much of its strength in the course of drying or seasoning; and therefore, in order to secure uniformity, his trees were all felled in the same season of the year, were squared the day after, and tried the third day. Trying them in this green state, gave him an opportunity of observing a very curious and unaccountable phenomenon. When the weights were laid briskly on, nearly sufficient to break the log, a very sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> was observed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the two ends with a sharp hissing noise. This continued all the while the tree was bending and cracking. This shows that the log is affected or strained through its whole length; indeed this must be inferred from its bending through its whole length. It also shows us the great effects of the compression. It is a pity M. Buffon did not take notice whether this smoke issued from the upper or compressed half of the section only, or whether it came from the whole.\n\nWe must now make some observations on these experiments, in order to compare them with the theory which we have endeavoured to establish.\n\nM. Buffon considers the experiments with the 5-inch bars as the standard of comparison, having both extended these to greater lengths, and having tried more pieces of each length.\n\nOur theory determines the relative strength of bars of the same section to be inversely as their lengths. But (if we except the five experiments in the first column) we find a very great deviation from this rule. Thus the 5-inch bar of 28 feet long should have half the strength of that of 14 feet, or 2650; whereas it is but 1775. The bar of 14 feet should have half the strength of that of 7 feet, or 5762; whereas it is but 5300. In like manner, the fourth of 11525 is 2881; but the real strength of the 28 feet bar is 1775. We have added a column A, which exhibits the strength which each of the 5-inch bars ought to have by the theory. This deviation is most distinctly seen in fig. 26, where BK is the scale of lengths, B being at the point 7 of the scale, and K at 28. The ordinate CB is = 11525, and the other ordinates DE, GK, &c. are respectively = \\(\\frac{7}{\\text{Length}}\\).\n\nThe lines DF, GH, &c. are made = 4350, 1775, &c., expressing the strengths given by experiment. The 10 feet bar and the 24 feet bar are remarkably anomalous. But all are deficient, and the defect has an evident progression from the first to the last. The same thing may be\nStrength of be shown of the other columns, and even of the first, though it is very small in that column. It may also be observed in the experiments of Belidor, and in all that we have seen. We cannot doubt therefore of its being a law of nature, depending on the true principles of cohesion, and the laws of mechanics.\n\nBut it is very puzzling, and we cannot pretend to give a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty. The only effect which we can conceive the length of a beam to have, is to increase the strain at the section of fracture by employing the intervening beam as a lever. But we do not distinctly see what change this can produce in the mode of action of the fibres in this section, so as either to change their cohesion or the place of its centre of effort: yet something of this kind must happen.\n\nWe see indeed some circumstances which must contribute to make a smaller weight sufficient, in Mr Buffon's experiments, to break a long beam, than in the exact inverse proportion of its length.\n\nIn the first place, the weight of the beam itself augments the strain as much as if half of it were added in form of a weight. Mr Buffon has given the weights of every beam on which he made experiments, which is very nearly 74 pounds per cubic foot. But they are much too small to account for the deviation from the theory. The half weights of the 5-inch beams of 7, 14, and 28 feet length are only 45, 92, and 182 pounds; which makes the real strains in the experiments 11560, 5390, and 1956; which are far from having the proportions of 4, 2, and 1.\n\nBuffon says that healthy trees are universally strongest at the root end; therefore, when we use a longer beam, its middle point, where it is broken in the experiment, is in a weaker part of the tree. But the trials of the 4-inch beams show that the difference from this cause is almost insensible.\n\nThe length must have some mechanical influence which the theory we have adopted has not yet explained. It may not however be inadequate to the task. The very ingenious investigation of the elastic curve by James Bernoulli and other celebrated mathematicians is perhaps as refined an application of mathematical analysis as we know. Yet in this investigation it was necessary, in order to avoid almost insuperable difficulties, to take the simplest possible case, viz. where the thickness is exceedingly small in comparison with the length. If the thickness be considerable, the quantities neglected in the calculus are too great to permit the conclusion to be accurate, or very nearly so. Without being able to define the form into which an elastic body of considerable thickness will be bent, we can say with confidence, that in an extreme case, where the compression in the concave side is very great, the curvature differs considerably from the Bernoullian curve. But as our investigation is incomplete and very long, we do not offer it to the reader. The following more familiar considerations will, we apprehend, render it highly probable that the relative strength of beams decreases faster than in the inverse ratio of their length. The curious observation by Mr Buffon of the vapour which issued with a hissing noise from the ends of a beam of green oak, while it was breaking by the load on its middle, shows that the whole length of the piece was affected: indeed it must be, since it is bent throughout. We have shown above, that a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> curvature of a beam of a given form is always accompanied by rupture. Now suppose the beam Strength of A of 10 feet long, and the beam B of 20 feet long, bent to the same degree, at the place of their fixture in the wall; the weight which hangs on A is nearly double of that which must hang on B. The form of any portion, suppose 5 feet, of these two beams, immediately adjoining to the wall, is considerably different. At the distance of 5 feet the curvature of A is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of its curvature at the wall. The curvature of B in the corresponding point is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)ths of the same curvature at the wall. Through the whole of the intermediate 5 feet, therefore, the curvature of B is greater than that of A. This must make it weaker throughout. It must occasion the fibres to slide more on each other (that it may acquire this greater curvature), and thus affect their lateral union; and therefore those which are stronger will not assist their weaker neighbours. To this we must add, that in the shorter beams the force with which the fibres are pressed laterally on each other is double. This must impede the mutual sliding of the fibres which we mentioned a little ago; nay, this lateral compression may change the law of longitudinal cohesion (as will readily appear to the reader who is acquainted with Bozovic's doctrines), and increase the strength of the very surface of fracture, in the same way (however inexplicable) as it does in metals when they are hammered or drawn into wire.\n\nThe reader must judge how far these remarks are worthy of his attention. The engineer will carefully keep in mind the important fact, that a beam of quadruple length, instead of having \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the strength, has only about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th; and the philosopher should endeavour to discover the cause of this diminution, that he may give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> a more accurate rule of computation.\n\nOur ignorance of the law by which the cohesion of the particles changes by a change of distance, hinders us from discovering the precise relation between the curvature and the momentum of cohesion; and all we can do between the two is to multiply experiments, upon which we may establish some empirical rules for calculating the strength of solids, and the momenta of which we must reason at present are too few and too anomalous to be the foundation of such an empirical formula. We may, however, observe, that Mr Buffon's experiments give us considerable assistance in this particular: For if to each of the numbers of the column for the 5-inch beams, corrected by adding half the weight of the beam, we add the constant number 1245, we shall have a set of numbers which are very nearly reciprocals of the lengths. Let 1245 be called c, and let the weight which is known by experiment to be necessary for breaking the 5-inch beam of the length a be called P. We shall have \\( \\frac{P + c \\times a}{l} = p \\). Thus the weight necessary for breaking the 7-foot bar is 11560. This added to 1245, and the sum multiplied by 7, gives \\( \\frac{89635}{18} = 1245 \\). Let l be 18; then \\( \\frac{89635}{18} = 3725 \\); \\( \\frac{3725}{p} \\), which differs not more than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th from what experiment gives us. This rule holds equally well in all the other lengths except the 10 and 24 foot beams, which are very anomalous. Such a formula is abundantly exact for practice, and will answer through a much greater variety of length, though it cannot be admitted as a true one; because, in a certain very great length,\nStrength of length, the strength will be nothing. For other sizes\nthe constant number must change in the proportion of\n\\(d^2\\), or perhaps of \\(f\\).\n\nRelation between the strength and the square of the depth of the section. This is made by comparing each other the numbers in any horizontal line of the table. In making this comparison we find the numbers of the five-inch bars uniformly greater than the rest. We imagine that there is something peculiar to these bars: They are in general heavier than in the proportion of their section, but not to such an extent as to account for all their superiority. We imagine that this set of experiments, intended as a standard for the rest, has been made at one time, and that the season has had a considerable influence. The fact however is, that if this column be kept out, or uniformly diminished about one-sixteenth in their strength, the different sizes will deviate very little from the ratio of the square of the depth, as determined by theory. There is however a small deficiency in the bigger beams.\n\nWe have been thus anxious in the examination of these experiments, because they are the only ones which have been related in sufficient detail, and made on a proper scale for giving us <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATA\">data</a> from which we can deduce confidential maxims for practice. They are too troublesome and expensive that we have little hopes of seeing their number greatly increased; yet surely our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> board would do an unspeakable service to the public by appropriating a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> for such experiments under the management of some man of science.\n\nThere remains another comparison which is of chief importance, namely, the proportion between the absolute cohesion and the relative strength. It may be guessed, from the very nature of the thing, that this must be very uncertain. Experiments on the absolute strength must be confined to very small pieces, by reason of the very great forces which are required for tearing them asunder. The values therefore deduced from them must be subject to great inequalities. Unfortunately we have got no detail of any experiments; all that we have to depend on is two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Mulchenbrock's \u00c9tats de Physique, in one of which he says that a piece of found oak \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches thick of an inch square is torn asunder by 1150 pounds; and in the other, that an oak plank 12 inches broad and one thick will just suspend 189163 pounds. These give for the cohesion of an inch square 15755 and 15763 pounds. Bouguer, in his Trait\u00e9 du Navire, says that it is very well known that a rod of found oak one fourth of an inch square will be torn asunder by 1000 pounds. This gives 16000 for the cohesion of a square inch. We shall take this as a round number, easily used in our computations. Let us compare this with M. Buffon's trials of beams four inches square.\n\nThe absolute cohesion of this section is 16000 \\(\\times\\) 16 = 256000. Did every fibre exert its whole force in the instant of fracture, the momentum of cohesion would be the same as if it had all acted at the centre of gravity of the section at 2 inches from the axis of fracture, and is therefore 512000. The 4-inch beam, 7 feet long, was broken by 5312 pounds hung on its middle. The half of this, or 2656 pounds, would have broken it, if suspended at its extremity, projecting 3\u00bd feet, or 42 inches from a wall. The momentum of this strain is therefore 2656 \\(\\times\\) 42 = 111552. Now this is in equilibrium with the actual momentum of cohesion, which is therefore 111552 instead of 512000. The strength is therefore diminished in the proportion of 512000 to 111552, or very nearly of 4:59 to 1.\n\nAs we are quite uncertain as to the place of the centre of effort, it is needless to consider the full cohesion as acting at the centre of gravity, and producing the momentum 512000; and we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the whole into a simple multiplier \\(m\\) of the length, and say, as \\(m\\) times the length is to the depth, so is the absolute cohesion of the section to the relative strength. Therefore let the absolute cohesion of a square inch be called \\(f\\), the breadth \\(b\\), the depth \\(d\\), and the length \\(l\\) (all in inches), the relative strength, or the external force \\(p\\), which balances it, is \\(\\frac{fb}{9l}\\); or in round numbers \\(\\frac{fb}{9l}\\); for \\(m = 2 \\times 4:59\\).\n\nThis great diminution of strength cannot be wholly accounted for by the inequality of the cohesive forces exerted in the instant of fracture; for in this case we know that the centre of effort is at \\(\\frac{1}{3}d\\) of the height in a rectangular section (because the forces really exerted are as the extensions of the fibres). The relative strength would be \\(\\frac{fb}{3l}\\), and \\(p\\) would have been 8127 instead of 2656.\n\nWe must ascribe this diminution (which is three times greater than that produced by the inequality of the cohesive forces) to the compression of the under part of the beam; and we must endeavour to explain in what manner this compression produces an effect which seems so little explicable by such means.\n\nAs we have repeatedly observed, it is a matter of nearly universal experience that the forces actually exerted by the particles of bodies, when stretched or compressed, are very nearly in the proportion of the distances to which the particles are drawn from their natural positions. Now, although we are certain that, in enormous compressions, the forces increase faster than in this proportion, this makes no sensible change in the present question, because the body is broken before the compressions have gone so far; nay, we imagine that the compressed parts are crippled in most cases even before the extended parts are torn asunder. Mulchenbrock affirms this with great confidence with respect to oak, on the authority of his own experiments. He says, that although oak will suspend half as much again as fir, it will not support, as a pillar, two-thirds of the load which fir will support in that form.\n\nWe imagine therefore that the mechanism in the present case is nearly as follows:\n\nLet the beam DCK \\(\\Delta\\) (fig. 27.) be loaded at its extremity with the weight \\(P\\), acting in the direction KP perpendicular to DC. Let DA be the section of fracture. Let DA be about one-third of DA. A will be the particle or fibre which is neither extended nor compressed. Make \\(\\Delta d : Dd = DA : AA\\). The triangles DA', DA' will represent the accumulated attracting and repelling forces. Make AI and AI = DA and \\(\\frac{1}{3}DA\\). The point I will be that to which the full cohesion \\(Dd\\) or \\(f\\) of the particles in AD must be applied, so as to produce the same momentum which the variable forces at I, D, &c. really produce at their several points of\nStrength of application. In like manner, \\( i \\) is the centre of the repulsive forces excited by the compression between \\( A \\) and \\( \\Delta \\), and it is the real fulcrum of a bent lever \\( I K \\), by which the whole effect is produced. The effect is the same as if the full cohesion of the stretched fibres in \\( AD \\) were accumulated in \\( I \\), and the full repulsion of all the compressed fibres in \\( A \\Delta \\) were accumulated in \\( i \\). The forces which are balanced in the operation are the weight \\( P \\), acting by the arm \\( k \\), and the full cohesion of \\( AD \\) acting by the arm \\( I i \\).\n\nThe forces exerted by the compressed fibres between \\( A \\) and \\( \\Delta \\) only serve to give support to the lever, that it may exert its strain.\n\nWe imagine that this does not differ much from the real procedure of nature. The position of the point \\( A \\) may be different from what we have deduced from Mr. Buffon's experiments, compared with Mulchenbroek's value of the absolute cohesion of a square inch. If this last should be only 12000, \\( DA \\) must be greater than we have here made it, in the proportion of 12000 to 16000. For \\( Ii \\) must still be made \\( = \\frac{1}{3} AD \\), supposing the forces to be proportional to the extensions and compressions. There can be no doubt that a part only of the cohesion of \\( DA \\) operates in resisting the fracture in all substances which have any compressibility; and it is confirmed by the experiments of Mr. Du Hamel on willow, and the inferences are by no means confined to that species of timber. We say therefore, that when the beam is broken, the cohesion of \\( AD \\) alone is exerted, and that each fibre exerts a force proportional to its extension; and the accumulated momentum is the same as if the full cohesion of \\( AD \\) were acting by the lever \\( Ii \\).\n\nIt may be said, that if only one-third of the cohesion of oak be exerted, it may be cut two-thirds through without weakening it. But this cannot be, because the cohesion of the whole is employed in preventing the lateral slide so often mentioned. We have no experiments to determine that it may not be cut through one-third without loss of its strength.\n\nThis must not be considered as a subject of mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> curiosity. It is intimately connected with all the practical uses which we can make of this knowledge; for it is almost the only way that we can learn the compressibility of timber. Experiments on the direct cohesion are indeed difficult, and exceedingly expensive if we attempt them in large pieces. But experiments on compression are almost impracticable. The most instructive experiments would be, first to establish, by a great number of trials, the transverse force of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> batten; and then to make a great number of trials of the diminution of its strength, by cutting it through on the concave side. This would very nearly give us the proportion of the cohesion which really operates in resisting fractures. Thus if it be found that one-half of the beam may be cut on the under side without diminution of its strength (taking care to drive in a slice of harder wood), we may conclude that the point \\( A \\) is at the middle, or somewhat above it.\n\nMuch lies before the curious mechanician, and we are as yet very far from a scientific knowledge of the strength of timber.\n\nIn the mean time, we may derive from these experiments of Buffon a very useful practical rule, without relying on any value of the absolute cohesion of oak. We see that the strength is nearly as the breadth, as the strength of square of the depth, and as the inverse of the length.\n\nIt is most convenient to measure the breadth and depth of the beam in inches, and its length in feet. Since, a useful then, a beam four inches square and seven feet between practical supports is broken by 5312 pounds, we must conclude that a batten one inch square and one foot between supports will be broken by 81 pounds. Then the Buffon's strength of any other beam of oak, or the weight which experiment will just break it when hung on its middle, is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b^2 d^2}{7}\n\\]\n\nBut we have seen that there is a very considerable deviation from the inverse proportion of the lengths, and we must endeavour to accommodate our rule to this deviation. We found, that by adding 1245 to each of the ordinates or numbers in the column of the five-inch bars, we had a set of numbers very nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> of the lengths; and if we make a similar addition to the other columns in the proportion of the cubes of the fixes, we have nearly the same result. The greatest error (except in the case of experiments which are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>) does not exceed \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\)th of the whole. Therefore, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> number, add to the 5312 the number 640, which is to 1245 very nearly as 4\\( ^3 \\) to 5\\( ^3 \\). This gives 5952. The 640th of this is 93, which corresponds to a bar of one inch square and seven feet long. Therefore 93\\( ^3 \\times 7 \\) will be the reciprocal corresponding to a bar of one foot. This is 651. Take from this the present empirical correction, which is \\( \\frac{b^2}{b^4} \\), or 10, and there remains 641 for the strength of the bar. This gives us for a general rule\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{b^2 d^2}{7} - 10 b d^2\n\\]\n\nExample. Required the weight necessary to break an oak beam eight inches square and 20 feet between the props, \\( \\rho = 651 \\times \\frac{8 \\times 8^3}{20} = 10 \\times 8 \\times 8^3 \\). This is 11545, whereas the experiment gives 11487. The error is very small indeed. The rule is most deficient in comparison with the five-inch bars, which we have already laid appear stronger than the rest.\n\nThe following proof is easily remembered by such as are not algebraists.\n\nMultiply the breadth in inches twice by the depth, and call this product \\( f \\). Multiply \\( f \\) by 651, and divide by the length in feet. From the quotient take 10 times \\( f \\). The remainder is the number of pounds which will break the beam.\n\nWe are not sufficiently sensible of our principles to be confident that the correction 10\\( f \\) should be in the proportion of the section, although we think it most probable. It is quite empirical, founded on Buffon's experiments. Therefore the safe way of using this rule is to suppose the beam square, by increasing or diminishing its breadth till equal to the depth. Then find the strength by this rule, and diminish or increase it for the change which has been made in its breadth. Thus, there can be no doubt that the strength of the beam given as an example is double of that of a beam of the same depth and half the breadth.\n\nThe reader cannot but observe that all this calculation relates to the very greatest weight which a beam will bear for a very few minutes. Mr. Buffon uniformly found...\nStrength of found that two-thirds of this weight sensibly impaired its strength, and frequently broke it at the end of two or three months. One-half of this weight brought the beam to a certain bend, which did not increase after the first minute or two, and may be borne by the beam for any length of time. But the beam contracted a bend, of which it did not recover any considerable portion. One-third seemed to have no permanent effect on the beam; but it recovered its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> shape completely, even after having been loaded several months, provided that the timber was seasoned when first loaded; that is to say, one-third of the weight which would quickly break a seasoned beam, or one-fourth of what would break one just felled, may lie on it for ever without giving the beam a set.\n\nWe have no detail of experiments on the strength of other kinds of timber: only Mr Buffon says, that fir has about $\\frac{6}{7}$ths of the strength of oak; Mr Parent makes it $\\frac{5}{8}$ths; Emerson, $\\frac{3}{4}$ths, &c.\n\nWe have been thus minute in our examination of the mechanism of this transverse strain, because it is the greatest to which the parts of our machines are exposed. We wish to impress on the minds of artists the necessity of avoiding this as much as possible. They are improving in this respect, as may be seen by comparing the centres on which stone arches of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAN\">span</a> are now turned with those of former times. They were formerly a load of mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> resting on a multitude of posts, which obstructed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, and were frequently losing their shape by some of the posts sinking into the ground. Now they are more generally trusses, where the beams abut on each other, and are relieved from transverse strains. But many performances of eminent artists are still very injudiciously exposed to cross strains. We may instance one which is considered as a fine work, viz. the bridge at Walton on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. Here every beam of the great arch is a joint, and it hangs together by framing. The finest piece of carpentry that we have seen is the centre employed in turning the arches of the bridge at Orleans, described by Perronet. In the whole there is not one cross strain. The beam, too, of Hornblower's steam-engine, described in that article, is very scientifically constructed.\n\nIV. The last species of strain which we are to examine is that produced by twisting. This takes place in all axes which connect the working parts of machines.\n\nAlthough we cannot pretend to have a very distinct conception of that modification of the cohesion of a body by which it resists this kind of strain, we can have no doubt that, when all the particles act alike, the resistance must be proportional to the number. Therefore if we suppose the two parts ABCD, ABFE (fig. 28.), of the body EFCD to be of insuperable strength, but cohering more weakly in the common surface AB, and that one part ABCD is pushed laterally in the direction AB, there can be no doubt that it will yield only there, and that the resistance will be proportional to the surface.\n\nIn like manner, we can conceive a thin cylindrical tube, of which KAH (fig. 29.) is the section, as cohering more weakly in that section than anywhere else. Suppose it to be grafted in both hands, and the two parts twisted round the axis in opposite directions, as we would twist the two joints of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a>, it is plain that it will first fail in this section, which is the circumference of a circle, and the particles of the two parts which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to this circumference will be drawn from each other laterally. The total resistance will be as the number of equally resisting particles, that is, as the circumference (for the tube being supposed very thin, there can be no sensible difference between the dilatation of the external and internal particles). We can now suppose another tube within this, and a third within the second, and so on till we reach the centre. If the particles of each ring exerted the same force (by suffering the same dilatation in the direction of the circumference), the resistance of each ring of the section would be as its circumference and its breadth (supposed indefinitely small, and the whole resistance would be as the surface; and this would represent the resistance of a solid cylinder. But when a cylinder is twisted in this manner by an external force applied to its circumference, the external parts will suffer a greater circular extension than the internal; and it appears that this extension (like the extension of a beam strained transversely) will be proportional to the distance of the particles from the axis. We cannot say that this is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRABLE\">demonstrable</a>, but we can assign no proportion that is more probable. This being the case, the forces simultaneously exerted by each particle will be as its distance from the axis. Therefore the whole force exerted by each ring will be as the square of its radius, and the accumulated force actually exerted will be as the cube of the radius; that is, the accumulated force exerted by the whole cylinder, whose radius is CA, is to the accumulated force exerted at the same time by the part whose radius is CE, as CA$^3$ to CE$^3$.\n\nThe whole cohesion now exerted is just two-thirds of what it would be if all the particles were exerting the same attractive forces which are just now exerted by the particles in the external circumference. This is plain to any person in the least familiar with the fluxionary calculus. But such as are not may easily see it in this way.\n\nLet the rectangle AC ca be set upright on the surface of the circle along the line CA, and revolve round the axis Cc. It will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> a cylinder whose height is Cc or Aa, and having the circle KAH for its base. If the diagonal Ca be supposed also to revolve, it is plain that the triangle c Ca will generate a cone of the same height, and having for its base the circle described by the revolution of ca, and the point C for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>. The cylindrical surface <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by Aa will express the whole cohesion exerted by the circumference AHK, and the cylindrical surface generated by Ec will represent the cohesion exerted by the circumference ELM, and the solid generated by the triangle CAa will represent the cohesion exerted by the whole circle AHK, and the cylinder generated by the rectangle AC ca will represent the cohesion exerted by the same surface if each particle had suffered the extension Aa.\n\nNow it is plain, in the first place, that the solid generated by the triangle Ec is to that generated by a AC as EC$^3$ to AC$^3$. In the next place, the solid generated by a AC is two-thirds of the cylinder, because the cone generated by c Ca is one-third of it.\n\nWe may now suppose the cylinder twisted till the particles in the external circumference lose their cohesion. There can be no doubt that it will now be wrenched asunder, all the inner circles yielding in succession. Thus we obtain one useful information, viz. that a body of homogeneous texture resists a simple twist with two-thirds\nStrength of thirds of the force with which it resists an attempt to force one part laterally from the other, or with one-third part of the force which will cut it asunder by a square-edged tool. For to drive a square-edged tool through a piece of lead, for instance, is the same as forcing a piece of the lead as thick as the tool laterally away from the two pieces on each side of the tool. Experiments of this kind do not seem difficult, and they would give us very useful information.\n\nWhen two cylinders AHK and BNO are wrenched asunder, we must conclude that the external particles of each are just put beyond their limits of cohesion, are equally extended, and are exerting equal forces. Hence it follows, that in the instant of fracture the sum total of the forces actually exerted are as the squares of the diameters.\n\nFor drawing the diagonal Ce, it is plain that Ee = Aa expresses the diffusion of the circumference ELM, and that the solid generated by the triangle Cee expresses the cohesion exerted by the surface of the circle ELM, when the particles in the circumference suffer the extension Ee equal to Aa. Now the solids generated by CAa and Cee being respectively two-thirds of the corresponding cylinders, are as the squares of the diameters.\n\nHaving thus ascertained the real strength of the section, and its relation to its absolute lateral strength, let us examine its strength relative to the external force employed to break it. This examination is very simple in the case under consideration. The straining force must act by some lever, and the cohesion must oppose it by acting on some other lever. The centre of the section may be the neutral point, whose position is not disturbed.\n\nLet F be the force exerted laterally by an exterior particle. Let a be the radius of the cylinder, and x the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> distance of any circumference, and x the indefinitely small interval between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> arches; that is, let x be the breadth of a ring and x its radius. The forces being as the extensions, and the extensions as the distances from the axis, the cohesion actually exerted at any part of any ring will be \\( f \\frac{x}{a} \\). The force exerted by the whole ring (being as the circumference or as the radius) will be \\( f \\frac{x^2}{a} \\). The momentum of cohesion of a ring, being as the force multiplied by its lever, will be \\( f \\frac{x^3}{a} \\). The accumulated momentum will be the sum or fluent of \\( f \\frac{x^3}{a} \\); that is, when \\( x = a \\), it will be \\( \\frac{1}{4} f a^3 \\).\n\nHence we learn that the strength of an axle, by which it resists being wrenched asunder by a force acting at a given distance from the axis, is as the cube of its diameter.\n\nBut farther, \\( \\frac{1}{4} f a^3 \\) is \\( f a^3 \\times \\frac{1}{4} a \\). Now \\( f a^3 \\) represents the full lateral cohesion of the section. The momentum therefore is the same as if the full lateral cohesion were accumulated at a point distant from the axis by one-fourth of the radius or one-eighth of the diameter of the cylinder.\n\nTherefore let F be the number of pounds which measures the lateral cohesion of a circular inch, d the diameter of the cylinder in inches, and l the length of the lever by which the straining force p is supposed to act, we shall have \\( F \\times \\frac{1}{8} d^3 = p l \\), and \\( F \\frac{d^3}{8l} = p \\).\n\nWe see in general that the strength of an axle, by which it resists being wrenched asunder by twisting, is as the cube of its diameter.\n\nWe see also that the internal parts are not acting so powerfully as the external. If a hole be bored out of the axle of half its diameter, the strength is diminished only one-eighth, while the quantity of matter is diminished one-fourth. Therefore hollow axles are stronger than solid ones containing the same quantity of matter. Thus let the diameter be 5 and that of the hollow 4; then Hollow the diameter of another solid cylinder having the same quantity of matter with the tube is 3. The strength of solid ones, the solid cylinder of the diameter 5 may be expressed by \\( \\frac{5^3}{64} = 61 \\). Of this the internal part (of the diameter 4) exerts 64; therefore the strength of the tube is \\( \\frac{125}{64} = 61 \\). But the strength of the solid axle of the same quantity of matter and diameter 3 is \\( \\frac{3^3}{64} = 27 \\), which is not half of that of the tube.\n\nEngineers, therefore, have of late introduced this improvement in their machines, and the axles of cast iron generally are all made hollow when their size will admit it. They used have the additional advantage of being much lighter, and of affording much better fixture for the flanges, which are used for connecting them with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> or levers by which they are turned and strained. The superiority of strength of hollow tubes over solid cylinders is much greater in this kind of strain than in the former or transverse. In this last case the strength of this tube would be to that of the solid cylinder of equal weight as 61 to 32 and a half nearly.\n\nThe apparatus which we mentioned on a former occasion for trying the lateral strength of a square inch of solid matter, enabled us to try this theory of twist with all desirable accuracy. The bar which hung down from the pin in the former trials was now placed in a horizontal position, and loaded with a weight at the extremity. Thus it acted as a powerful lever, and enabled the ratio to be wrench asunder specimens of the strongest materials. We found the results perfectly conformable to the theory, in as far as it determined the proportional strength of different sizes and forms; but we found the lateral ratio of the resistance to twisting to the simple lateral resistance distance considerably different; and it was some time before we discovered the cause.\n\nWe had here taken the simplest view that is possible of the action of cohesion in resisting a twist. It is frequently exerted in a very different way. When, for instance, an iron axle is joined to a wooden one by being driven into one end of it, the extensions of the different circles of particles are in a very different proportion. A little consideration will show that the particles in immediate contact with the iron axle are in a state of violent extension; so are the particles of the exterior surface of the wooden part, and the intermediate parts are less strained. It is almost impossible to assign the exact proportion of the cohesive forces exerted in the different parts.\nStrength of parts. Numberless cases can be pointed out where parts of the axle are in a state of compression, and where it is still more difficult to determine the state of the other particles. We must content ourselves with the deductions made from this simple case, which is fortunately the most common. In the experiments just now mentioned the centre of the circle is by no means the neutral point, and it is very difficult to ascertain its place; but when this consideration occurred to us, we easily freed the experiments from this uncertainty, by extending the lever to both sides, and by means of a pulley applied equal force to each arm, acting in opposite directions. Thus the centre became the neutral point, and the resistance to twist was found to be two-thirds of the simple lateral strength.\n\nWe beg leave to mention here that our success in these experiments encouraged us to extend them much farther. We hoped by these means to discover the absolute cohesion of many substances, which would have required an enormous apparatus and a most unmanageable force to tear them asunder directly. But we could reason with confidence from the resistance to twist (which we could easily measure), provided that we could ascertain the proportion of the direct and the lateral strengths. Our experiments on chalk, finely prepared clay, and white bees-wax (of one melting and one temperature), were very consistent and satisfactory. But we have hitherto found great irregularities in this proportion in bodies of a fibrous texture like timber. These are the most important cases, and we still hope to be able to accomplish our project, and to give the public some valuable information. This being our sole object, it was our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> to mention the method which promises success, and thus excite others to the task; and it will be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to us to be deprived of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being the first who thus adds to the stock of experimental knowledge.\n\nWhen the matter of the axle is of the most simple texture, such as that of metals, we do not conceive that the length of the axle has any influence on the fracture. It is otherwise if it be of a fibrous texture like timber: the fibres are bent before breaking, being twisted into spirals like a cork-screw. The length of the axle has somewhat of the influence of a lever in this case, and it is easier wrenched asunder if long. Accordingly we have found it so; but we have not been able to reduce this influence to calculation.\n\nOur readers are requested to accept of these endeavours to communicate information on this important and difficult subject. We are duly sensible of their imperfection, but flatter ourselves that we have in many instances pointed out the method which must be pursued for improving our knowledge on this subject; and we have given the English reader a more copious list of experiments on the strength of materials than he will meet with in our language. Many useful deductions might be made from these premises respecting the manner of disposing and combining the strength of materials in our structures. The best form of joints, mortises, tenons, scarfings; the rules for joggling, tabling, faying, fitting, &c., practised in the delicate art of mait-making, are all founded on this doctrine: but the discussion of these would be equivalent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a complete treatise of carpentry.

But her reply to me was, that she conceived this was a strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; yet, to prove the contrary, a few days after there was one William Mother of Saltersbridge in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Liffmore, who brought his son William to my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, desiring my wife to cure him, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> ready to afford her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> to her neighbours, according to her small skill in chirurgery.\u201d\nchirurgery. On which my wife told me, there was one that had the king's evil very grievously in the eyes, cheek, and throat; whereupon I told her, that she should now see whether this was a bare fancy or imagination, as the thought it, or the dictates of God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">Spirit</a> on my heart. Then I laid my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on the places affected, and prayed to God for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>' sake to heal him; and bid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> two or three days afterwards to bring the child to me again, which accordingly he did; and I then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the eye was almost quite whole; and the node, which was almost as big as a pullet's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, was supplicated; and the throat strangely amended; and, to be brief (to God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> I speak it) within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> discharged itself quite, and was perfectly healed, and so continues, God be praised.\n\nThen there came to him one Margaret Mackshane of Ballinlecky, in the parish of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISMORE\">Lismore</a>, who had been afflicted with the evil above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, in a much more violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; and soon after, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> increasing, he cured the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in many other persons for three years. He did not meddle all this time with any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>; till about the end of these three years, theague growing epidemical, he found, as formerly, that there was bestowed on him the gift of curing that disease.

According to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> he had been promised that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> by the minister, but had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to see the professorship bestowed on another, and all his hopes blasted by the influence of Dr. Robertson, whom he represented as under obligations to him.\n\nTo the writer of this article, who was a stranger to these rival candidates for historical fame, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the story seems very incredible; as it is not easy to conceive how it ever could be in the power of Dr. Stuart to render to the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">Principal</a> any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. It was believed indeed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCHAN\">Buchan</a>, and by others, who observed that the illiberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> not unfrequent in the world of letters, was probably the source of this opposition; which entirely broke the intimacy of two persons who, before that time, were understood to be on the most friendly footing with each other. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, however, is as likely to have been the vice of Dr. Stuart as of Dr. Robertson; for we have been told by a writer*, who, at least in one instance, has completely proved what he affirms, that \u201csuch was Gilbert Stuart\u2019s laxity of principle as a man, that he considered ingratitude as one of the most venial sins; such was his conceit as a writer, that he regarded no one\u2019s merits but his own; such were his disappointments, both as a writer and a man, that he allowed his prejudices to four into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a>, and indulged his malevolence till it settled in corruption.\u201d\n\nSoon after this disappointment, Dr. Stuart went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, where he became from 1768 to 1774 one of the writers of the Monthly Review. In 1772 Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-school at Edinburgh, published a Latin Grammar, which he intended as an improvement of the famous Ruddiman\u2019s. Stuart attacked him in a pamphlet under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Bubby, and treated him with much severity. In doing this, he was probably actuated more by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> dislike of Dr. Adam than by regard for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his learned relation; for on other occasions he showed sufficiently that he had no regard to Ruddiman\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a>, editor, or critic.\n\nIn 1774 he returned to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and began the Edinburgh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> and Review, in which he discussed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and constitution of England, and distinguished himself by an inquiry into the character of John Knox the reformer, whose principles he reproved in the severest terms. About this time he revised and published Sullivan\u2019s Lectures on the Constitution of England. Soon after he turned his thoughts to the history of Scotland, and published Observations concerning its Public Law and Constitutional History; in which he examined with a critical care the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> book to Dr. Robertson\u2019s History. His next work was The History of the Reformation; a book which deserves praise for the easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the narrative, and for strict impartiality. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> work, The History of Scotland from the Establishment of the Reformation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">Death</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, which appeared in 1782, has been very generally read and admired. His purpose was to vindicate the character of the injured queen, and expose the weakness of the arguments by which Dr. Robertson had endeavoured to prove her guilty: but though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of this work is his own, it contains very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which was not furnished by Goodall and Tyler; and it is with the arms which these two writers put into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that Dr. Stuart attacked his great antagonist.\n\nIn 1782 he once more visited London, and engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERALD\">Herald</a> and English Review; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a> and droop increasing on him, he returned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, where he died in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of his father on the 19th of August 1786.\n\nIn his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> Dr. Stuart was about the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and justly proportioned. His countenance was modest and expressive, sometimes glowing with sentiments of friendship, of which he was truly susceptible, and at others darting that satire and indignation at folly and vice which appear in some of his writings. He was a boon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>; and, with a constitution that might have stood the shock of ages, he fell a premature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> to intemperance. His talents were certainly great, and his writings are useful; but he seems to have been influenced more by passion than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, and in his character there was not much to be imitated.","sp":424,"ep":424},{"h":"STUCCO","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble pulverized, and mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> of lime; and the whole being fitted and wrought up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, is to be used like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> plaster: this is called by Pliny muroratum opus, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBARIUM_OPUS\">albarium opus</a>.\nA patent has been granted to Mr B.

And where a coarse and a fine land of this kind, and corresponding in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of their grains with the coarse and fine lands hereafter described, cannot be easily procured, let such land of the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> be chosen as may be sorted and cleansed in the following manner:\n\n\"Let the land be sifted in streaming clear water, through a sieve which shall give passage to all such grains as do not exceed one-sixteenth of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>; and let the stream of water and the sifting be regulated so that all the land, which is much finer than the Lynn-land <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> glasshouses, together with clay and every other matter specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than land, may be washed away with the stream, whilst the purer and coarser land, which passes through the sieve, subsides in a convenient receptacle, and whilst the coarse rubbish and rubble remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the sieve to be rejected.\n\n\"Let the land which thus subsides in the receptacle be washed in clean streaming water through a finer sieve, so as to be further cleansed and sorted into two parcels; a coarser, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> remain in the sieve which is to give passage to such grains of land only as are less than one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter, and which is to be saved apart under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of coarse land; and a finer, which will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the sieve and subside in the water, and which is to be saved apart under the name of fine land.\u2014Let the coarse and the fine land be dried separately, either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> or on a clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> plate, let on a convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, in the manner of a land-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> (B).\n\n\"Let lime be chosen (C) which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-lime, which heats the most in flaking, and flakes the quickest when duly watered; which is the freest made and closest kept; which dissolves in distilled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> with the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>, and leaves the smallest residue insoluble, and in this residue the smallest quantity of clay, gypsum, or martial matter.\n\n\"Let the lime chosen according to these important rules be put in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>-wired sieve to the quantity of 14 pounds. Let the sieve be finer than either of the foregoing; the finer, the better it will be; let the lime be flaked (D) by plunging it in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUTT\">butt</a> filled with soft water, and raising it out quickly and suffering it to heat and fume, and by repeating this plunging and raising alternately, and agitating the lime, until it be made to pass through the sieve into the water; and let the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the lime which does not easily pass through the sieve be rejected; and let fresh portions of the lime be thus used, until as many (E) ounces of lime have passed through the sieve as there are quarts of water in the butt. Let the water thus impregnated stand in the butt closely covered (F) until it becomes clear; and through wooden (G) cocks placed at different heights in the butt, let the clear liquor be drawn off as fast (H) and as\n\n(A) \"This is commonly called pit-land.\n\n(B) \"The land ought to be stirred up continually until it is dried, and is then to be taken off; for otherwise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> will be very slow, and the land which lies next the iron plate, by being overheated, will be discoloured.\n\n(C) \"The preference given to stone-lime is founded on the present practice in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of lime, and on the closer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of it, which prevents it from being so soon injured by exposure to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> as the more spongy chalk-lime is; not on the popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> that stone-lime has something in it whereby it excels the best chalk in the cementing properties. The gypsum contained in lime-stone remains unaltered, or very little altered, in the lime, after the burning; but it is not to be expected that clay or martial matter should be found in their native state in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-burned lime; for they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a> or vitrify with a part of the calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and constitute the hard grains or lumps which remain undissolved in weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, or are separable from the flaked lime by sifting it immediately through a sieve.\n\n(D) \"This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of impregnating the water with lime is not the only one which may be adopted. It is, however, preferred before others, because the water clears the sooner in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of its being warmed by the flaking lime; and the gypseous part of the lime does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> itself in the water so freely in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> as it does when the lime is flaked to fine powder in the common method, and is then blended with the water; for the gypseous part of the lime flakes at first into grains rather than into fine powder, and will remain on the sieve after the pure lime has passed through, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to admit of the intended separation; but when the lime is otherwise flaked, the gypseous grains have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to flake to a finer powder, and passing through the sieve, dissolve in the water along with the lime. I have imagined that other advantages attended this method of preparing the lime-water, but I cannot yet speak of them with precision.\n\n(E) \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the water contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDULOUS\">acidulous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> than is usually found in river or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> water, a fourth part of this quantity of lime, or less, will be sufficient.\n\n(F) \"The calcareous crust which forms on the surface of the water ought not to be broken, for it afflicts in excluding the air, and preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of acidulous gas whereby the lime-water is spoiled.\n\n(G) \"Brass-cocks are apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> a part of the liquor.\n\n(H) \"Lime-water cannot be kept many days unimpaired, in any vessels that are not perfectly air-tight.

This clear liquor I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the cementing liquor (1). The freer the water is from saline matter, the better will be the cementing liquor made with it.\n\nLet 56 pounds of the aforesaid chosen lime be flaked, by gradually sprinkling on it, and especially on the unflaked pieces, the cementing liquor, in a clofe (i) clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Let the flaked part be immediately (i) fitted through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>-mentioned fine brafs-wired sieve: Let the lime which passes be used instantly, or kept in air-tight vessels, and let the part of the lime which does not pass through the sieve be rejected (ii).\n\nThis finer richer part of the lime which passes through the sieve I call purified lime.\n\nLet bone-ash be prepared in the usual manner, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the whitest burnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, but let it be fitted, to be much finer than the bone-ash commonly sold for making cupels.\n\nThe most eligible materials for making my cement being thus prepared, take 56 pounds of the coarse land and 42 pounds of the fine land; mix them on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> plank of hard wood placed horizontally; then spread the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> so that it may stand to the height of six inches, with a flat surface on the plank; wet it with the cementing liquor; and let any superfluous quantity of the liquor, which the sand in the condition described cannot retain, flow away off the plank. To the wettest sand add 14 pounds of the purified lime in several successive portions, mixing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> them up together in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time with the instruments generally used in making fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>: then add 14 pounds of the bone-ash in successive portions, mixing and beating all together. The quicker and the more perfectly these materials are mixed and beaten together, and the sooner the cement thus formed is used, the better (iv) it will be. This I call the water-cement coarse-grained, which is to be applied in building, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a>, plastering, stuccoing, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, as mortar and stucco now are; with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> chiefly, that as this cement is shorter than mortar or common stucco, and dries sooner, it ought to be worked expeditiously in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; and in stuccoing, it ought to be laid on by sliding the trowel upwards on it; that the materials used along with this cement in building, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> on which it is to be laid in stuccoing, ought to be well wetted with the cementing liquor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> of laying on the cement; and that the cementing liquor is to be used when it is necessary to moisten the cement, or when a liquid is required to facilitate the floating of the cement.\n\nWhen such cement is required to be of a finer texture, take 98 pounds of the fine land, wet it with the cementing liquor, and mix it with the purified lime and the bone-ash in the quantities and in the manner above described; with this difference only, that 15 pounds of lime, or (o) thereabouts, are to be used instead of 14 pounds, if the greater part of the land be as fine as Lynn-land. This I call water-cement fine-grained. It is to be used in giving the last coating, or the finish to any work intended to imitate the finer-grained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> or stucco. But it may be applied to all the uses of the water-cement coarse-grained, and in the same manner.\n\nWhen for any of the foregoing purposes of pointing, building, &c., such a cement is required much cheaper and coarser-grained, then much coarser clean land than the foregoing coarse land, or well-washed fine rubble, is to be provided. Of this coarse land or rubble take 56 pounds, of the foregoing coarse land 28 pounds, and of the fine land 14 pounds; and after mixing these, and wetting them with the cementing liquor in the foregoing manner, add 14 pounds, or somewhat less, of the (v) purified lime, and then 14 pounds or somewhat less.\n\nused after it is drawn limpid from the butt into open vessels, it will grow turbid again, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> the lime changed to whitening by the gas absorbed from the air. The calcareous matter which subsides in the butt resembles whitening the more nearly as the lime has been more sparingly employed; in the contrary circumstances, it approaches to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of lime; and in the intermediate state, it is fit for the common composition of the plasterers for inside stucco.\n\n(1) \"At the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> this specification, I preferred this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> before that of lime-water, on grounds which I had not sufficiently examined.\n\n(i) \"The vapour which arises in the flaking of lime contributes greatly to the flaking of these pieces which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in its way; and an unnecessary waste of the liquor is prevented, by applying it to the lime heaped in a pit or in a vessel, which may restrain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of the vapour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> it through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. If more of the liquor be used than is necessary to flake the lime, it will create <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in weighing the flaked powder, and will prevent a part of it from passing freely through the sieve. The liquid is therefore to be used sparingly, and the lime which has escaped its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> is to be sprinkled apart with fresh liquor.\n\n(ii) \"When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGGREGATION\">aggregation</a> of the lumps of lime is thus broken, it is impaired much sooner than it is in the former state, because the air more freely pervades it.\n\n(iii) \"Because it consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> matter or of ill-burnt lime; which last will flake and pass through the sieve, if the lime be not immediately fitted after the flaking, agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>.\n\n(iv) \"These proportions are intended for a cement made with sharp sand, for incrustation in exposed situations, where it is necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the effects of hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> and rain. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, half this quantity of bone-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> will be found sufficient; and although the incrustation in this latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> will not harden deeply so soon, it will be ultimately stronger, provided the weather be favourable.\n\n(v) \"The injuries which lime and mortar sustain by exposure to the air, before the cement is finally placed in a quiescent state, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>; and therefore our cement is the worse for being long beaten, but the better as it is quickly beaten until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> is effected, and no longer.\n\n(o) \"The quantity of bone-ashes is not to be increased with that of the lime; but it is to be lessened as the exposure and purposes of the work will admit.\n\n(p) \"Because less lime is necessary, as the sand is coarser.\"\nless of the bone-ash, mixing them together in the manner already described.

Gray sand, and gray bone-ashes formed of half-burnt bones, are to be chosen to make the cement gray; and any other colour of the cement is obtained, either by choosing coloured sand, or by the admixture of the necessary quantity of coloured talc in powder, or of coloured, vitreous, or metallic powders, or other durable colouring ingredients commonly used in paint.\n\n\"To the end that such a water-cement as I have described may be made as useful as it is possible in all circumstances; and that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> may imagine that my claim and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> under these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LETTERS_PATENT\">letters-patent</a> may be eluded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> variations, which may be made in the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> without producing any notable defect in the cement; and to the end that the principles of this art, as well as the art itself, of making my cement, may be gathered from this specification and perpetuated to the public; I shall add the following observations:\n\n\"This my water-cement, whether the coarse or fine grained, is applicable in forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> stone, by making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of the cement and of flint, hard stone, or brick, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the intended stone, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the masses so formed to the open air to harden.\n\n\"When such cement is required for water fences, two-thirds of the prescribed quantity of bone-ashes are to be omitted; and in the place thereof an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of powdered terras is to be used; and if the sand employed be not of the coarsest sort, more terras must be added, so that the terras shall be by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> one-sixth part of the weight of the sand.\n\n\"When such a cement is required of the finest grain (s) or in a fluid form, so that it may be applied with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, flint powder, or the powder of any quartofe or hard earthy substance, may be used in the place of terras; but in a quantity smaller, as the flint or other powder is finer; so that the flint-powder, or other such powder, shall not be more than five times the weight of the lime, nor less than four times its weight. The greater the quantity of lime within these limits, the more will the cement be liable to crack by quick drying, and vice versa.\n\n\"Where such sand as I prefer cannot be conveniently procured, or where the sand cannot be conveniently washed and sorted, that sand which most resembles the mixture of coarse and fine sand above prescribed, may be used as I have directed, provided due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to the quantity of the lime, which is to be greater (t) as the quantity is finer, and vice versa.\n\n\"Where sand cannot be easily procured, any durable stony body, or baked earth grossly powdered (u), and sorted nearly to the sizes above prescribed for sand, may be used in the place of sand, measure for measure, but not weight for weight, unless such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> powder be as heavy specifically as sand.\n\n\"Sand may be cleansed from every softer, lighter, and less durable matter, and from that part of the sand which is too fine, by various methods preferable (x), in certain circumstances, to that which I have described.\n\n\"Water may be found naturally free from fixable gas, feline, or clay; such water may, without any notable inconveniences, be used in the place of the cementing liquor; and water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> this state will not require so much lime as I have ordered to make the cementing liquor; and a cementing liquor sufficiently useful may be made by various methods of mixing lime and water in the described proportions, or nearly so.\n\n\"When stone-lime cannot be procured, chalk-lime, or shell-lime, which best resembles stone-lime, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> above written of lime, may be used in the manner\n\n(Q) \"But they must not be exposed to the rain until they are almost as strong as fresh Portland stone; and even then they ought to be sheltered from it as much as the circumstances will admit. These stones may be made very hard and beautiful, with a small expense of bone-ash, by soaking them, after they have dried thoroughly and hardened, in the lime liquor, and repeating this process twice or thrice, at distant intervals of time. The like effect was experienced in incrustations.\n\n(R) \"In my experiments, mortar made with terras-powder, in the usual method, does not appear to form so strong a cement for water-fences as that made, according to the specification, with coarse sand; and I see no more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for avoiding the use of sand in terras-mortar, than there would be for rejecting stone from the embankment. The bone-ashes present in this place are the dark gray or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> sort. I am not yet fully satisfied about the operation of them in this instance.\n\n(S) \"The qualities and uses of such fine calcareous cement are recommended chiefly for the purpose of smoothing and finishing the stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRUCIFORM\">cruciform</a> works, or for washing walls to a lively and uniform colour.

It is true, as Sir William Blackstone observes, this succession, through fraud or force, or sometimes through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, when in hostile times the crown descended on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> or the like, has been very frequently suspended; but has generally at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> returned back into the old hereditary channel, though sometimes a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> has intervened. And even in those instances where this succession has been violated, the crown has ever been looked upon as hereditary in the wearer of it. Of which the usurpers themselves were so sensible, that they for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> endeavoured to vamp up some feeble show of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> by descent, in order to amuse the people, while they gained the possession of the kingdom. And, when possession was once gained, they considered it as the purchase or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>, and transmitted, or endeavoured to transmit it, to their own posterity by a kind of hereditary right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURPATION\">usurpation</a>. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>. Com. vol. i. 197\u2014217.) From the historical view there given, it appears that the title to the crown is at present hereditary, though not quite so absolutely hereditary as formerly: and the common flock or ancestor, from whom the descent must be derived, is also different. Formerly the common flock was King Egbert; then William the Conqueror; afterwards, in James I.'s time, the two common flocks united; and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the vacancy of the throne in 1688: now it is the Prince's Sophia in whom the inheritance was vested by the new king and parliament. Formerly, the descent was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>, and the crown went to the heir without any restriction: but now, upon the new settlement, the inheritance is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a>: being limited to such heirs only, of the body of the Prince's Sophia, as are Protestant members of the church of England, and are married to none but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>.\n\nAnd in this due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> consists the true constitutional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the right of succession to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> crown of these kingdoms. The extremes between which it fleers are each of them equally destructive of those ends for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> were formed and kept on foot. Where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, upon every succession, is elected by the people, and may by the express provision of the laws be deposed (if not punished) by his subjects, this may found like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and look <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> enough when delineated on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>; but in practice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be ever productive of tumult, contention, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>. And, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> indefeasible hereditary right, when coupled with the doctrine of unlimited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience, is surely of all constitutions the most thoroughly flavished and dreadful. But when such an hereditary right as our laws have created and vested in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> stock, is closely interwoven with those liberties which are equally the inheritances of the subject; this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>\nunion will form a constitution, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> the most beautiful of any, in practice the most approved, and, we trust, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> the most permanent.\n\nIn France the succession to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> was limited to heirs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> (see Salic); but in Navarre the crown was inherited by the heir of line, whether male or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> stands thus: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> the Fourth, king of France, surnamed the Fair, in the year 1285 espoused Jane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of Navarre in her own right; and as king consort of this latter kingdom added the title of Navarre to his former one of France. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> X. son and heir of Philip and Jane (surnamed Hutin or the Boilereous), succeeded to both crowns. By Margaret his first wife, who had been crowned queen of Navarre, he left one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, Joan or Jane. His second wife Clementina was pregnant at the time of his decease, and was delivered of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> son, whom most of the French annalists recognize as John I. of France, though he lived no longer than three weeks. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> the kingdom of France passed to Philip V. (surnamed the Long), and that of Navarre (to which the Salic law could by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> extend) to Joanna the only child and heir of Louis and Margaret. From Joanna, in lineal succession, the kingdom of Navarre passed to Jane d'Albret, mother of Henry IV. of France, and wife of Anthony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VENDOME\">Vendome</a>, who as king consort wore the crown of Navarre. On the accession of Henry to the kingdom of France, the two monarchies were united, and the four succeeding princes assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> titles.\n\nSuccinic acid, an acid extracted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATION\">sublimation</a> in a gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and which rises in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a> form into the neck of the subliming vessel.

He discovered an uncommon propensity to the acquiring of languages, in so much that he is reported to have spoken Latin at five years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and to have written it at nine. When he grew Suckling up, he travelled; but seems to have affected nothing more than the character of a courtier and fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>; which he so far attained, that he was allowed to have the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of making every thing he did become him. In his travels he made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> Gustavus Adolphus; and his loyalty, if not his valour, appeared in the beginning of our civil wars; for, after his return to England, he raised a troop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> for the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> entirely at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>; and mounted them so completely and richly, that they are said to have cost him 12,000l. This troop, with Sir John at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, behaved so ill in the engagement with the Scots, upon the English borders, in 1639, as to occasion the famous lampoon composed by Sir John Mennis; \"Sir John he got him an ambling nag,\" &c. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAD\">ballad</a>, which was set to a brisk tune, was much sung by the parliamentarians, and continues to be sung to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. This disastrous expedition, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> that attended it, was supposed to have hastened his death; being seized by a fever, of which he died, at 28 years of age.

During his disgrace he composed many works, which are lost. Those now extant are his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the XII first Emperors, and a part of his treatise of the Illustrious Grammarians and Rhetoricians. Pliny the Younger was his intimate friend, and persuaded him to publish his books. His History of the XII Roman Emperors has been much commended by most of our polite scholars.

The fortres is a defenceless heap of ruins, which the Arabs consider as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>, because it contains six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> four-pounders, and two Greek gunners, who turn their heads aside when they fire. The harbour is a wretched quay, where the smallest boats are unable to reach the shore, except at the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>. There, however, the merchandise is embarked, to convey it over the banks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> to the vessels which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>. This road, situated a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from the town, is separated from it by a flore which is left dry at low water; it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> works for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, so that the vessels which Mr. Volney tells us he has seen there, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 28 at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, might be attacked without opposition; for the ships themselves are incapable of resistance, none having any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> than four rusty swivels.\n\nSuez has always been, notwithstanding its local disadvantages, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> trade, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its geographical situation. It was by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of Suez that the commodities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> were formerly conveyed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, till the discovery of the passage by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a> converted that trade into a new channel. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> of Suez, which separates the Red Sea from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, is not more than 57 miles, it has been frequently proposed to join these two seas together by a canal. As there are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> nor remarkable inequalities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> would at first view appear easy to be executed. But though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of levels would not prevent a junction, the great difficulty arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the corresponding coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red sea, which are of a low and sandy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, where the waters form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, shoals, and marshes, so that vessels cannot approach within a considerable distance. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> therefore be found scarcely possible to dig a permanent canal amid these shifting sands: not to mention, that the shore is destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, which must be entirely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of art. The country besides has not a drop of fresh water, and to supply the inhabitants, it must be brought as far as from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>.\n\nThe best and only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> therefore of effecting this junction, is that which has been already successfully practised at different times; which is, by making the river itself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, for which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> is perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> calculated; for Mount Makatun suddenly terminating in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of Cairo, forms only a low and semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOUND\">mound</a>, round which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> plain from the banks of the Nile as far as the point of the Red sea. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, who early understood the advantage to be derived from this situation, adopted the idea of joining the two seas by a canal connected with the river. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> * observes, that this was first executed under Seleucus, who reigned about the time of the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and this work was so formidable as to occasion it to be remarked, \"that it was 100 cubits (or 170 feet) wide, and deep enough for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessels.\" After the Greeks conquered the country, it was restored by the Ptolemies, and again renewed by Trajan. In short, even the Arabs themselves followed these examples. \"In the time of Omar ibn-el-Kattab (says the historian El Makin), the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> and Medina suffering from famine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIPH\">caliph</a> ordered Amrou governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> to cut a canal from the Nile to Kolumzoum, that the contributions of corn and barley appointed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> might be conveyed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>.\"\n\nThis canal is the same which runs at present to Cairo, and lies itself in the country to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east of Berket-el-Hadj, or the Lake of the Pilgrims.\n\nThe place on the west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the gulf of Suez, where the children of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a> are supposed to have entered it, is called Badea, about six miles to the north of Cape Korondel, on the other side of the gulf, as we are informed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Edward Worley Montague, F.R.S. to Dr. Watson, containing an account of his journey from Cairo to the Written Mountains in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SINAI\">Sinai</a>. Opposite to Badea is a strong current which sets to the opposite shore, about south-east, with a whirlpool called Birque Pharaone, the well or pool of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a>, being the place where his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a> is said to have been destroyed. We are told by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, that the Egyptian shore from Suez to Badea is so rocky and steep, that there was no entering upon the gulf but at one of these two places.\n\nThe British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, we believe, never attempted to carry on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with any of the ports of the Red Sea beyond Jidda, till, on the suggestion of Mr. Bruce, in 1776, some British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a> equipped two or three vessels for Suez, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with piece-goods of Bengal and coast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. The command of the vessels was committed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Greig, a meritorious seaman; and the management of the goods was entrusted to Mr. Straw, a gentleman distinguished for his mercantile knowledge. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> turned out to advantage; but such\nsuch great expenses were incurred in making presents to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BEY\">bey</a> of Cairo and Suez, as to consume the whole profits gained by the sale of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARGO\">cargo</a>. The great purpose of the expedition was, however, accomplished, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIRMAN\">firman</a> was obtained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Cairo to trade by the way of Suez. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, three ships went to Suez the following year, and as many in 1778. The opening of this trade alarmed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> of the East India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>; they applied to our government, and orders were given to relinquish this promising commerce. These orders reached Egypt sooner than Bengal, and the consequence was fatal to the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> who visited Suez that year (1779). By a plan concerted between the beys, a large body of Bedouin Arabs attacked the caravan passing from Suez to Cairo with goods valued at 12 lacks of rupees. The goods were plundered, the Europeans were stripped and left naked in the desert, exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, without a drop of water to quench their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>, or food to support <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Most of them died, and some of their bodies were afterwards found mangled and disfigured by wolves.

Since sugar then is reckoned so precious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>, it must be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of desire to all persons of curiosity and research, to obtain some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the plant by which it is produced, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as to understand the processes by which the juice is extracted and refined. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> therefore first inquire in what countries it originally flourished, and when it was brought into general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, and became an article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>.\n\nFrom the few remains of the Grecian and Roman authors which have survived the ravages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, we can find <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> proofs that the juice of the sugar-cane was known.\nat a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. There can be no doubt, however, that in those countries where it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGENOUS\">indigenous</a> its value was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> concealed. It is not improbable that it was known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Jews; for there is some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to suppose, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> word \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, which occurs frequently in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, and is by our translators rendered sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALAMUS\">calamus</a> and sometimes sugar-cane, does in fact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the sugar-cane. The first passage in which we have observed it mentioned is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXODUS\">Exodus</a> xxx. 23., where Moses is commanded to make an ointment with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>, kene, and cassia. Now the kene does not appear to have been a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> nor of Judea; for in Jeremiah vi. 20. it is mentioned as coming from a far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. \"To what purpose cometh there to me <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a> from Sheba and the sweet-cane from a far country?\" This is not true of the calamus aromaticus, which grows spontaneously in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, as well as in many parts of Europe. If the cinnamon mentioned in the passage of Exodus quoted above was true cinnamon, it must have come from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies, the only country in the world from which cinnamon is obtained. There is no difficulty therefore in supposing, that the sugar-cane was exported from the same country. If any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> be due to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, it confirms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that kene denotes the sugar-cane; for the Latin word canna and the English word cane are evidently derived from it. It is also a curious fact, that sugar or flecker, in Hebrew, signifies inebriation, from which the Greek word \u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \"sugar,\" is undoubtedly to be traced.\n\nThe sugar-cane was first made known to the western parts of the world by the conquests of Alexander the Great. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> relates that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEARCHUS\">Nearchus</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> found it in the East Indies in the year before Christ 325. It is evidently alluded to in a fragment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>, preserved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHOTIUS\">Photius</a>. Varro, who lived A.C. 68., describes it in a fragment quoted by Isidorus as a fluid pressed from reeds of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, which was sweeter than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIOSCORIDES\">Dioscorides</a>, about the year 35 before Christ, says \"that there is a kind of honey called faccharon, which is found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> Felix. It has the appearance of salt, and is brittle when chewed. If dissolved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, it is beneficial to the bowels and stomach, is useful in diseases of the bladder and kidneys, and, when sprinkled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the eye, removes those substances that obscure the sight.\" This is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> we have of its medical qualities. Galen often prescribed it as a medicine. Lucan relates, that an oriental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with Pompey used the juice of the cane as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>.\n\nQuoque bilibunt tenera dulces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> arundine succos.\nLib. iii. 237.\n\nPliny says it was produced in Arabia and India, but that the best came from the latter country. It is also mentioned by Arrian, in his Periplus of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of \u03a3\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (sachar) as an article of commerce from India to the Red sea. Aelian, Tertullian, and Alexander Aphrodiseus mention it as a species of honey procured from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANES\">canes</a> (A.).\n\nThat the sugar-cane is an indigenous plant in some parts of the East Indies, we have the strongest reason to believe; for Thunberg found it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, and accordingly mentioned it as a native of that country in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORA\">Flora</a> Japonica, published in 1784. Olfeck also found it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> in 1751. It may indeed have been transplanted from some other country; but as it does not appear from history that the inhabitants of Japan or China ever carried on any commerce with remote nations, it could only be conveyed from some neighbouring country. Marco <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLO\">Polo</a>, a noble Venetian, who travelled into the East about the year 1250, found sugar in abundance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>. Vasco de Gama, who doubled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a> in 1497, relates, that a considerable trade in sugar was then carried on in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALICUT\">Calicut</a>. On the authority of Dioscorides and Pliny, too, we should be disposed to admit, that it is a native of Arabia, did we not find, on consulting Niebuhr's Travels, that botanist has omitted it when enumerating the most valuable plants of that country. If it be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> production of Arabia, it must still flourish in its native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Mr Bruce found it in Upper Egypt. If we may believe the relation of Giovan Lioni, a considerable trade was carried on in sugar in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a> in 1500; it abounded also at Thebes, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, and in the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, about the same period.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the sugar-cane was introduced into Europe during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSADES\">crusades</a>; expeditions into Europe which however romantic in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and unsuccessful probably in their execution, were certainly productive of many advantages to the nations of Europe. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBERTUS\">Albertus</a> Aquensis, a monkish writer, observes, that the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a> frequently derived refreshment and support during a scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> by sucking the canes. This plant flourished also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOREA\">Morea</a>, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>; from which it was transported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> it is not easy to ascertain; but we are sure that sugar was cultivated in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> previous to the year 1166; for Lafran\u00e7ais, the Jesuit, who wrote a history of the Portuguese discoveries, mentions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DONATION\">donation</a> made that year to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of St Bennet, by William the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Sicily, of a mill for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> sugar-canies, with all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, members, and appurtenances.\n\nFrom Sicily, where the sugar-cane still flourishes on the sides of Mount Hybla, it was conveyed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a>, the Canary and Cape de Verd islands, soon after they were discovered in the 15th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.\n\nAn opinion has prevailed, that the sugar-cane is not a native of the western continent, or its adjacent islands by some the West Indies, but was conveyed thither by the Spaniards or Portugueze soon after the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> or by Columbus. From the testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>, in the West Indies, the third book of his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECADE\">decade</a>, composed during Co-Indies, Columbus's second voyage, which commenced in 1493 and ended in 1495, it appears, that the sugar-cane was known at that time in Hispaniola. It may be said, that it was brought thither by Columbus; but for this assertion we have found no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>; and though we had\n\n(A) For a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> account of the history of sugar in the early and middle ages, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> Transactions, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">Volume</a> IV. by Dr Falconer, may be consulted.\nSugar had direct evidence, this would not prove that the sugar-cane was not an indigenous plant of the West Indies. There are authors of learning who, after investigating this subject with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, do not hesitate to maintain, that it is a native both of the islands and of the continent of America.\n\nP. Labat has supported this opinion with much appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and, in particular, he appeals to the testimony of Thomas Gage, an Englishman, who visited New Spain in 1625. Gage enumerates sugar-canes among the provisions with which the Caribes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUADALOUPE\">Guadaloupe</a> supplied his ship. \"Now (says Labat) it is a fact that the Spaniards had never cultivated an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> in the smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTILLES\">Antilles</a>. Their ships <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> touched at those islands indeed for wood and water; and they left twine in the view of supplying with fresh provisions such of their countrymen as might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> there in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a>; but it would be absurd in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to suppose, that they would plant sugar-canes, and at the same time put hogs ashore to destroy them.\n\nNeither had the Spaniards any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for bestowing this plant on islands which they considered as of no kind of importance, except for the purpose that has been mentioned; and to suppose that the Charaibes might have cultivated, after their departure, a production of which they knew nothing, betrays a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> disposition and character.\n\n\"But (continues Labat) we have surer testimony, and such as proves, beyond all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, that the sugar-cane is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> production of America. For, besides the evidence of Francis Ximenes, who, in a Treatise on American Plants, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, affirms, that the sugar-cane grows without cultivation, and to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> size, on the banks of the river Plate, we are assured by Jean de Lery, a Protestant minister, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a> in 1556 to the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> in the fort of Coligny, on the river Janeiro, that he himself found sugar-canes in great abundance in many places on the banks of that river, and in situations never visited by the Portuguese. Father Hennepen and other voyagers bear testimony in like manner to the growth of the cane near the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a>; and Jean de Laet in its spontaneous production in the island of St Vincent. It is not for the plant itself, therefore, but for the secret of making sugar from it, that the West Indies are indebted to the Spaniards and Portuguese; and these to the nations of the east.\"\n\nSuch is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> of Labat, which the learned Lafitau has pronounced incontrovertible; and it is greatly strengthened by recent discoveries, the sugar-cane having been found in many of the islands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> by our late illustrious navigator <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook.\n\nThe sugar-cane, or saccharum officinarum of botanists, is a jointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>, commonly measuring (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> not included) from three feet and a half to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> feet in height, but sometimes rising to 12 feet. When ripe it is of a fine straw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> inclining to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, producing leaves or blades, the edges of which are finely and sharply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a>, and terminating in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> decorated with a panicle. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> in one stalk are from 40 to 60 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and the stalks rising from one root are sometimes very numerous. The young shoot ascends from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> like the point of an arrow; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a> of which soon breaks, and the two first leaves, which had been inclosed within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> sheath of seminal leaves, rise to a considerable height (b).\n\nAs the cane is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> succulent plant, it must require soil most strong deep soil to bring it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, perhaps in favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> no soil can be too rich for this purpose. The soil to its which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has found to be most favourable to the growth cultivation of it in the West Indies is the dark gray loam of St Christopher's, which is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and porous as to be penetrable by the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the hoe. The under stratum is gravel from 8 to 12 inches deep. Canes planted in particular spots in this island have been known to yield 8000 pounds of Mulcovado sugar from a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> produce of the island for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years has been 16,000 hogheads of 16 cwt., which is one-half only of the whole cane-land, or 8,500 acres. When annually cut, it gives nearly two hogsheads of 16 cwt. per acre for the whole of the land in ripe canes.\n\nNext to the ash loam of St Christopher's is the soil which in Jamaica is called brick-mould; not as resembling a brick in colour, but as containing such a due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of clay and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> as is supposed to render it well adapted for the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILN\">kiln</a>. It is a deep, warm, and mellow, hazel earth, easily worked; and though its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> soon grows dry after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, the under stratum retains a considerable degree of moisture in the driest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; with this advantage too, that even in the wettest season it seldom requires trenching. Plant-canies, by which is meant canes of the first growth, have been known in very fine seasons to yield two tons and a half of sugar per acre. After this may be reckoned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mould of several varieties. The best is the deep black earth of Barbadoes, Antigua, and some other of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a> islands; but there is a species of this mould in Jamaica that is but little, if any thing inferior to it, which abounds with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> and flint on a sub-stratum of foamy marle. Black mould on clay is more common; but\n\n(b) \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of canes, when standing, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November, when it is in arrow or full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOSSOM\">blossom</a> (says Mr Beckford in his descriptive Account of the Island of Jamaica), is one of the most beautiful productions that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> can possibly describe. It in common rises from three to eight feet or more in height; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of growth that very strongly marks the difference of soil or the varieties of culture. It is when ripe of a bright and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> yellow; and where obvious to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, is in many parts very beautifully streaked with red: the top is of a darkish green; but the more dry it becomes, from either an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of ripeness or a continuance of drought, of a ruffet yellow, with long and narrow leaves depending; from the centre of which shoots up an arrow like a silver wand from two to six feet in height; and from the summit of which grows out a plume of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> feathers, which are delicately fringed with a lilac dye; and indeed is, in its appearance, not much unlike the tuft that adorns this particular and elegant tree.\"\nbut as the mould is generally shallow, and the clay stiff and retentive of water, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> sort of land requires great labour, both in ploughing and trenching, to render it profitable. When manured and properly pulverized, it becomes very productive. It is unnecessary to attempt a minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of all the other soils which are found in these islands. There is, however, a peculiar sort of land on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> side of Jamaica, chiefly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Trelawney, that cannot be passed over unnoticed, not only on account of its scarcity but its value; few soils producing finer sugars, or such as answer so well in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a>; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> signifying a greater return of refined sugar than common. The land alluded to is generally of a red colour; the shades of which, however, vary considerably from a deep chocolate to a rich scarlet; in some places it approaches to a bright yellow, but it is everywhere remarkable, when first turned up, for a glossy or shining surface, and if wetted stains the fingers like paint.\n\nAs in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> there is a season more favourable for vegetation than others, it is of great importance that plants for seed be committed to the ground at the commencement of this season. As the cane requires a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of moisture to bring it to maturity, the properest season for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> it is in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, when the autumnal rains commence, that it may be sufficiently luxuriant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> the ground before the dry weather sets in. Thus the root is kept moist, and the crop is ripe for the mill in the beginning of the ensuing year. Canes planted in the month of November, or later in the season, lose the advantage of the autumnal rains; and it often happens that dry weather in the beginning of the ensuing year retards their vegetation until the vernal or May rains set in, when they sprout both at the roots and the joints; so that by the time they are cut the field is loaded with unripe suckers instead of sugar-canes. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> plant, however, commonly turns out well; but canes planted very late in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, though they have the benefit of the May rains, seldom answer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>; for they generally come in unseasonably, and throw the ensuing crops out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. They are therefore frequently cut before they are ripe; or if the autumnal season sets in early, are cut in wet weather, which has probably occasioned them to spring afresh; in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the effect is the same: The juice is uncooled, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, the root is deprived of its natural nourishment, to the great injury of the ratoon. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> objection to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> plant is this, that the canes become rank and top-heavy, at a period when violent rains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> winds are expected, and are therefore frequently lodged before they are fit to be cut.\n\nThe sugar-cane is propagated by the top-shoots, which are cut from the tops of the old canes. The usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of planting in the West Indies is this: The quantity of land intended to be planted, being cleared of weeds and other incumbrances, is first divided into several plots of certain dimensions, commonly from 15 to 20 acres each; the spaces between each plot or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> are left wide enough for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, for the convenience of carting, and are called intervals. Each plot is then subdivided, by means of a line and wooden pegs, into small squares of about three feet and a half. Sometimes indeed the squares are a foot larger; but this circumstance makes but little difference. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> are then placed in a row in the first line, one to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and directed to dig out with their hoes the several squares, commonly to the depth of five or six inches. The mould which is dug up being formed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> at the lower side, the excavation or cane-hole field exceeds 15 inches in width at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, and two feet and a half at the top. The negroes then fall back to the next line, and proceed as before. Thus the several squares between each line are formed into a trench of much the same dimensions with that which is made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>. An able negro will dig from 100 to 120 of these holes for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; but if the land has been previously ploughed and lain fallow, the same negro will dig nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the number in the same time (c).\n\nThe cane-holes or trench being now completed, whether by the plough or by the hoe, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTINGS\">cuttings</a> selected for planting, which are commonly the tops of the canes that have been ground for sugar (each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> containing five or six gems), two of them are sufficient for a cane hole of the dimensions described. These, being placed longitudinally in the bottom of the hole, are covered with mould about two inches deep; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the bank being intended for future use. In 12 or 14 days the young sprouts begin to appear; and as soon as they rise a few inches above the ground, they are, or ing it, ought to be, carefully cleared of weeds, and furnished with an addition of mould from the banks. This is usually performed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. At the end of four or five months the banks are wholly levelled, and the spaces between the rows carefully hoe-ploughed. Frequent cleanings, while the canes are young, are indeed of essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, that no other merit in an overseer can compensate for the want of attention in this particular. A careful manager will remove at the same time all the lateral shoots or suckers that spring up after the canes begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, as they seldom come to maturity, and draw nourishment from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> plants.\n\n\"In the cultivation of other lands, in Jamaica especially (says Mr Edwards, the elegant historian of the West Indies, whose superior excellence has induced us frequently to refer to him in the course of this article), the plough has been introduced of late years, and in some few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to great advantage; but it is not every soil or situation that will admit the use of the plough; some lands being much too stony, and others too steep; and I am sorry I have occasion to remark, that a practice\n\n(c) As the negroes work at this business very unequally, according to their different degrees of bodily strength, it is sometimes the practice to put two negroes to a single square; but if the land has not had the previous assistance of the plough, it commonly requires the labour of 50 able negroes for 13 days to hole 20 acres. In Jamaica, some gentlemen, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their own slaves, have this laborious part of the planting-business performed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">job</a>-work. The usual price for holing and planting is 6l. currency per acre (equal to 4l. 7s. sterling). The cost of falling and clearing heavy wood-land is commonly as much more.\ntice commonly prevails in Jamaica, on properties where this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> is used, which would exhaust the finest lands in the world. It is that of ploughing, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-ploughing, round-ridging, and harrowing the same lands from year to year, or at least every other year, without affording <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>: accordingly it is found that this method is utterly destructive of the ratoon or second growth, and altogether ruinous. It is indeed astonishing that any planter of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> under so pernicious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>. Some gentlemen, however, of late manage better: their practice is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> up stiff and clayey land, by one or two ploughings, early in the spring, and give it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>'s fallow. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> following, being then mellow and more easily worked, it is holed and planted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour after the old method, which has been already described.\n\nBut in truth, the only advantageous system of ploughing in the West Indies is to confine it to the simple operation of holing, which may certainly be performed with much greater facility and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a> by the plough than by the hoe; and the relief which, in the case of stiff and dry soils, is thus given to the negroes, exceeds all estimation, in the mind of a humane and provident owner. On this subject I speak from practical knowledge. At a plantation of my own, the greatest part of the land which is annually planted is neatly and sufficiently laid into cane-holes, by the labour of one able <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, three boys, and eight oxen, with the common single-wheeled plough. The ploughshare indeed is somewhat wider than usual; but this is the only difference, and the method of ploughing is the simplest possible. By returning the plough back along the furrow, the turf is alternately thrown to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and to the left, forming a trench seven inches deep, about two feet and a half wide at the top, and one foot wide at the bottom. A space of 18 or 20 inches is left between each trench, on which the mould being thrown by the share, the banks are properly formed, and the holing is complete. Thus the land is not exhausted by being too much exposed to the sun; and in this manner a field of 20 acres is holed with one plough, and with great ease, in 13 days. The plants are afterwards placed in the trench as in the common method, where manual labour alone is employed.\n\nIn most parts of the West Indies it is usual to hole and plant a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the cane-land, commonly one-third, in annual rotation. Canes of the first year's growth are called plant canes, as has been already observed. The sprouts that spring from the roots of the canes that have been previously cut for sugar are called ratoons; the first yearly returns from their roots are called first ratoons; the second year's growth second ratoons.\n\nMr Edwards informs us, that the manure generally used is a compost formed, 1st, Of the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> drawn from the fires of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> and still houses, 2dly, Feculencies discharged from the still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, mixed up with rubbish of buildings, white-lime, &c., 3dly, Refuse, or field-trash (i.e.), the decayed leaves and stems of the canes; to called in contradistinction to cane-trash, reserved for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>. 4thly, Dung, obtained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULE\">mule</a> stables, and from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> pens, or small inclosures made by posts and rails, occasionally shifted upon the lands intended to be planted, and into which the cattle are turned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. 5thly, Good mould, collected from gullies and other waste places, and thrown into the cattle-pens.\n\nThe sugar-cane is liable to be destroyed by monkeys, rats, and insects. The upland plantations suffer greatly cane destroyed from monkeys; these creatures, which now abound in the mountainous parts of St Christopher's, were first brought thither by the French, when they possessed half that island; they come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from the rocks in silent parties by night, and having posted sentinels to give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> if anything approaches, they destroy incredible quantities of the cane, by their gambols as well as their greediness. It is in vain to set traps for these creatures, however baited; and the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to protect the plantation, and destroy them, is to set a numerous watch, well armed with fowling-pieces, and furnished with dogs. The negroes will perform this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> cheerfully, for they are very fond of monkeys as food. The celebrated Father Labat says, they are very delicious, but the white inhabitants of St Kitt's never eat them.\n\nThe low-land plantations suffer as much by rats as those on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> do from monkeys; but the rats, no more than the monkeys, are natives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; they came with the shipping from Europe, and breed in the ground under loose rocks and bulks: the field negroes eat them greedily, and they are said to be publicly sold in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> at Jamaica. To free the plantations from these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>, the breed of wild cats should be encouraged, and snakes suffered to multiply unmolested; they may also be poisoned with arsenic, and the rasped root of the caltava made into pellets, and plentifully scattered over the grounds. This practice, however, is dangerous; for as the rats when thus poisoned become exceeding thirsty, they run in droves to the neighbouring streams, which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> as they drink, and the cattle grazing on the banks of these polluted waters have frequently perished by drinking after them. It is safer therefore to make the pellets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a>, kneaded with the juice of the nightshade, the scent of which will drive them away though they will not eat it. There is an East Indian animal called mungoos, which bears a natural antipathy to rats; if this animal was introduced into our sugar islands, it would probably extirpate the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of these noxious vermin. The formica omnivora of Linn\u00e6us, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANT\">ant</a>, which is called in Jamaica the raffle's ant, would soon clear a sugar plantation of rats.\n\nThe sugar-cane is also subject to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> which no and inoffensive can obviate, and for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> has hitherto in vain attempted to find a remedy. This disease is called the blight, and is occasioned by a species of aphis. When this happens, the fine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, green blades become sickly, dry, and withered; soon after they appear flattened in spots; and if these spots are carefully examined, they will be found to contain innumerable eggs of an insect like a bug, which are soon quickened, and cover the plants with the vermin: the juice of the canes thus affected becomes sour, and no future shoot issues from the joints. Ants also concur with the bugs to spoil the plantation, and against these evils it is hard to find a remedy.\n\nThe crops of sugar-can\u00e9s do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> precisely at the same period in all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>. In the Danish, Spanish, and Dutch settlements, they begin in January, and continue till October. This method does not imply any fixed season for the maturity of the sugar-cane. The crop ripens\nplant, however, like others, must have its progress; and it hath been justly observed to be in flower in the months of November and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>. It must necessarily follow, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> these nations have adopted of continuing to gather their crops for 10 months without intermission, that they cut some canes which are not ripe enough, and others that are too ripe, and then the fruit hath not the requisite qualities. The time of gathering them should be at a fixed season, and probably the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> are the fittest for it; because all the sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> are ripe at that time, while the four ones do not arrive at a state of maturity till the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> and August.\n\nThe English cut their canes in March and April; but they are not induced to do this on account of their ripeness. The drought that prevails in their islands renders the rains which fall in September necessary to their planting; and as the canes are 18 months in growing, this period always brings them to the precise point of maturity (D).\n\n\"The time of crop in the sugar islands (says Mr Edwards) is the season of gladness and festivity to man and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>. So palatable, salutary, and nourishing, is the juice of the cane, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, drinking freely of it, derives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and vigour from its use. The meagre and sickly among the negroes exhibit a surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in a few weeks after the mill is set in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. The labouring horses, oxen, and mules, though almost constantly at work during this season, yet, being indulged with plenty of the green tops of this noble plant, and some of the scumblings from the boiling-house, improve more than at any other period of the year. Even the pigs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> fatten on the refuse. In short, on a well-regulated plantation, under a humane and benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>, there is such an appearance during crop-time of plenty and busy cheerfulness, as to soften, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, the hardships of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, and induce a spectator to hope, when the miseries of life are represented as insupportable, that they are sometimes exaggerated through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of fancy.\"\n\nThe plants being cut, the branches at the top are given to the cattle for food; the top-shoot, which is full of eyes, is preserved for planting. The canes are cut into pieces about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> long, tied up in bundles, and carried in carts to the mill, where they are bruised, and the juice is extracted from them. The mill consists principally of three upright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-plated rollers or cylinders, from 30 to 40 inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and from 20 to 25 inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>; and the middle one, to which the moving power is applied, turns the other two by means of cogs. Between these rollers, the canes (being previously cut short, and tied into bundles) are twice compressed; for having passed through the first and second rollers, they are turned round the middle one by a circular piece of frame-work or screen, called in Jamaica the Dumb-returner, and forced back through the second and third; an operation which squeezes them completely dry, and sometimes even reduces them to powder. The cane juice is received in a leaden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and thence conveyed into a vessel called the receiver. The refuse, or macerated rind of the cane (which is called cane-wood, in contradistinction to field-wood), serves for fuel to boil the liquor.\n\nThe juice as it flows from the mill, taken at a medium, contains eight parts of pure water, one part of extracted sugar, and one part consisting of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and mucilaginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, with a portion of essential oil.\n\nAs this juice has a strong disposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, vessels used must be boiled as soon as possible. There are some water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> that will grind with great ease canes sufficient for 30 hogheads of sugar in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. It is necessary to have boiling vessels, or clarifiers, that will correspond in dimensions to the quantity of juice flowing from the receiver. These clarifiers are commonly three in number, and are sometimes capable of containing 1000 gallons each; but it is more usual to see them of 300 or 400 gallons each. Besides the clarifiers which are used for the first boiling, there are generally four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> or boilers. The clarifiers are placed in the middle or at one end of the boiling-house. If at one end, the boiler called the teache is placed at the other, and several boilers (generally three) are ranged between them. The teache is ordinarily from 70 to 100 gallons, and the boilers between the clarifiers and teache diminish in size from the first to the last. Where the clarifiers are in the middle, there is usually a set of three boilers of each side, which constitute in effect a double boiling-house. On very large estates this arrangement is found useful and necessary. The objection to so great a number is the expense of fuel; to obviate which, in some degree, the three boilers on each side of the clarifiers are commonly hung to one fire.\n\nThe juice runs from the receiver along a wooden gutter, lined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> into the boiling-house, where it is received into one of the clarifiers. When the clarifier is filled, a fire is lighted, and a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> quicklime in powder, which is called temper, is poured into the vessel. The use of the lime is to unite with the superabundant acid, which, for the success of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, it is necessary to get rid of. The quantity sufficient to separate the acid must vary according to the strength of the quicklime and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the liquor. Some planters allow a pint of lime to every 100 gallons of liquor; but Mr Edwards thinks that little more than half the quantity is a better medium proportion, and even then, that it ought to be dissolved in boiling water, that as little of it as possible may be precipitated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is suffered gradually to increase till it approaches within a few degrees of the heat of boiling water, that the impurities\n\n(D) The account given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a> concerning the time when the sugar-canies are collected, we have taken from the Able Raynal's History of the Trade and Settlements of the East and West Indies; but Mr Cazaud observes, that in February, March, and April, all the canes, whatever be their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, are as ripe as the nature of the soil ever allows them to be. He says farther, that the dryness of the weather, and not the age of the canes, which increases from January to April, is the cause that in January 400 gallons of juice commonly yield 48 gallons of sugar and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLASSES\">molasses</a>, one with another; in February from 56 to 64; in March from 64 to 72; in April sometimes 80; after which period the sugar ferments, and even burns, when the refiner is not very expert at his business.\npurities may be thoroughly separated. But if the liquor were suffered to boil with violence, the impurities would again incorporate with it. It is known to be sufficiently heated when the foam begins to rise in blisters, which break into white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a>, and appear generally in about 45 minutes. The fire is then suddenly extinguished by means of a damper, which excludes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the liquor is allowed to remain about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> undisturbed, during which period the impurities are collected in scum on the surface. The juice is then drained off either by a syphon or a cock; the scum being of a tenacious gummy nature, does not flow out with the liquor, but remains behind in the clarifier. The liquid juice is conveyed from the clarifier by a gutter into the evaporating boiler, commonly termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> copper; and if it has been obtained from good canes it generally appears transparent.\n\nIn the evaporating boiler, which should be large enough to receive the contents of the clarifier, the liquor is allowed to boil; and as the foam rises it is taken off. The scumming and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the liquor becomes finer and thicker, and so far diminished in bulk that it may be easily contained in the second copper. When put into the second copper, it is nearly of the colour of Madeira wine; the boiling and scumming are continued, and if the impurities be considerable, a quantity of lime-water is added. This process is carried on till the liquor be sufficiently diminished in quantity to be contained in the third copper. After being purified a third time, it is put into the fourth copper, which is called the teache, where it is boiled and evaporated till it is judged sufficiently pure to be removed from the fire. In judging of the purity of the liquor, many of the negroes (says Mr Edwards) guess solely by the eye (which by long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> they do with great accuracy), judging by the appearance of the grain on the back of the ladle; but the practice most in use is to judge by what is called the touch; i.e. taking up with the thumb a small portion of the hot liquor from the ladle; and, as the heat diminishes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> with the fore-finger the liquid into a thread. This thread will suddenly break, and shrink from the thumb to the suspended finger, in different lengths, according as the liquor is more or less boiled. The proper boiling height for strong mulecado sugar is generally determined by a thread of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch long. It is evident, that certainty in this experiment can be attained only by long habit, and that no verbal precepts will furnish any degree of skill in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> depending wholly on constant practice.\n\nThe juice being thus purified by passing through the clarifier and four coppers, it is poured into coolers, which are usually six in number. The removal from the teache to the cooler is called striking. The cooler is a shallow wooden vessel seven feet long, from five to six wide, about 11 inches deep, and capable of containing a hoghead of sugar. As the liquor cools, the sugar grains, that is, collects into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a>, separating itself from the molasses. It is then removed from the cooler, and conveyed to the curing-house, where the molasses drain from it. For receiving them there is a large cistern, the sloping sides of which are lined with boards. Directly above the cistern a frame of joint-work without boarding is placed, on which empty hogheads without heads are ranged. The bottoms of these hogheads are pierced with 8 or 10 holes, in each of which the stalk of a plantain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> is fixed so as to project six or eight inches below the joints, and rise a little above the top of the hoghead. The hogheads being filled with the contents of the cooler, consisting of sugar and molasses, the molasses being liquid, drain through the spongy stalk, and drop into the cistern. After the molasses are drained off, the sugar becomes pretty dry and fair, and is then called myconado or raw sugar.\n\nWe have described the process for extracting sugar, which is generally adopted in the British West India islands, according to the latest improvements; and have been anxious to present it to our readers in the simplest and most perspicuous form, that it might be intelligible to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; and have therefore avoided to mention the observations and proposed amendments of those who have written on this subject. Had we done so, we should have swelled the present article to too great a size, without accomplishing the purpose which we have in view; for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> is not to instruct the planters, but to give a distinct account of the most approved methods which the planters have generally adopted. But though we judge it useless to trouble our readers with all the little varieties in the process which different persons employ, we flatter ourselves it will not be disagreeable to learn by what methods the French make their sugar purer and whiter than ours. A quantity of sugar from the cooler is put into conical pans or earthen purifying pots, called by the French former, having a small perforation at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>, which is kept closed. Each cone, reversed on its apex, is supported in another earthen vessel. The syrup is filtered together, and then left to crystallize. At the end of 15 or 16 hours, the hole in the point of each cone is opened, that the impure syrup may run out. The base of these sugar loaves is then taken out, and white pulverized sugar substituted in its stead; which being well pressed down, the whole is covered with clay moistened with water. This water filters through the mass, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> the syrup with it which was mixed with the sugar, but which by this management flows into a pot substituted in the place of the first. This second fluid is called fine syrup. Care is taken to moisten and keep the clay to a proper degree of softness as it becomes dry. The sugar loaves are afterwards taken out, and dried in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a> for eight or ten days; after which they are pulverized, packed, and exported to Europe, where they are still farther purified. The reason assigned why this process is not universally adopted in the British sugar islands is this, that the water which dilutes and carries away the molasses dissolves and carries with it so much of the sugar, that the difference in quality does not pay for the difference in quantity. The French planters probably think otherwise, upwards of 400 of the plantations of St Domingo having the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> for claying and actually carrying on the system.\n\nThe art of refining sugar was first made known to the Europeans by a Venetian, who is said to have received refining for 100,000 crowns for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. This discovery was made before the new world was explored; but whether it was an invention of the person who first communicated it, or whether it was conveyed from China, where it had been known for a considerable time before, cannot now perhaps be accurately ascertained. We find no mention\nSugar.\n\nSugar. Mention made of the refining of sugar in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> till the year 1659, though it probably was practiced several years before. For in the Portuguese island of St Thomas in 1624 there were 74 sugar ingenios, each having upwards of 200 slaves. The quantity of raw sugar imported into England in 1778 amounted to 1,403,995 cwts.; the quantity imported into Scotland in the same year was 117,285 cwts.; the whole quantity imported into Great Britain in 1787 was 1,926,741 cwts.\n\nThe sugar which undergoes the operation of refining in Europe is either raw sugar, sometimes called mucovado or caffonado, which is raw sugar in a purer state. The raw sugar generally contains a certain quantity of molasses as well as earthy and feculent substances. The caffonado, by the operation of earthing, is freed from its molasses. As the intention of refining these sugars is to give them a higher degree of whiteness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, it is necessary for them to undergo other processes. The first of these is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARIFICATION\">clarification</a>. It consists in dissolving the sugar in a certain proportion of lime-water, adding a proper quantity of bullock's blood, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> it to heat in order to remove the impurities which still remain. The heat is increased very gradually till it approaches that of boiling water. By the assistance of the heat, the animal matter which was thrown in coagulates, at the same time that it attracts all the solid feculent and earthy matter, and raises it to the surface in the appearance of a thick foam of a brownish colour. As the feculencies are never entirely removed by a first process, a second is necessary. The solution is therefore cooled to a certain degree by adding some water; then a fresh quantity of blood, but less considerable than at first, is poured in. The fire is renewed, and care is taken to increase the heat gently as before. The animal substance settles on the impurities which remain, collects them on the surface, and they are then skimmed off. The same operation is repeated a third and even a fourth time, but no addition is made to the liquor except water. If the different processes have been properly conducted, the solution will be freed from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPURITY\">impurity</a>, and appear transparent. It is then conveyed by a gutter into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> balkeet about 16 inches deep, lined with a woollen cloth; and after filtering through this cloth, it is received in a cistern or copper which is placed below.\n\nThe solution being thus clarified, it undergoes a second general operation called evaporation. Fire is applied to the copper into which the solution was received, and the liquid is boiled till it has acquired the proper degree of consistence. A judgement is formed of this by taking up a small portion of the liquid and drawing it into a thread. When, after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, it is found sufficiently viscous, the fire is extinguished, and the liquid is poured into coolers. It is then stirred violently by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> called an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, from the resemblance it bears to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAR\">oar</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>. This is done in order to diminish the viscosity, and promote what is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATION\">granulation</a>, that is, the forming of it into grains or imperfect crystals. When the liquid is properly mixed and cooled, it is then poured into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> of the form of a sugar loaf. These moulds are ranged in rows. The small ends, which are lowest, are placed in pots; and they have each of them apertures stopped up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> for filtering the syrup, which runs from the moulds into the pots. The liquor is then taken out slowly in ladles from the coolers, and poured into the moulds. Sugar. When the moulds are filled, and the contents still in a fluid state, it is necessary to stir them, that no part may adhere to the moulds, and that the small crystals which pour into are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> formed may be equally diffused through the moulds, whole mass. When the sugar is completely crystallized where the zed, the linen is taken away from the apertures in the syrup moulds, and the syrup, or that part which did not crystallize, descends into the pots in which the moulds are placed. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATION\">purgation</a> the moulds are removed and fixed in other pots, and a stratum of fine white clay diluted with water is laid on the upper part of the loaf. The water descending through the sugar by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, mixes with the syrup which still remains in the body of the loaf, and washes it away. When the clay dries, it is taken off, and another covering of moist clay put in its place; and if it be not then sufficiently walled, a third covering of clay is applied. After the lastly exposed loaves have stood some days in the moulds, and have acquired a considerable degree of firmness and solidity, certain of them are taken out, and carried to a stove, where they are gradually heated to the 50\u00b0 of Reaumur (64\u00b0 of Fahrenheit), in order to dissipate any moisture which may be still confined in them. After remaining in the stove eight days, they are taken out; and after cutting off all discolouring specks, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> if still wet, they are wrapped in blue paper, and are ready for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. The several syrups collected during the different parts of the process, treated in the same manner which we have just described, afford sugars of inferior quality; and the last portion, which no longer affords any sugar, is sold by the name of molasses.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of refined sugar, when formed into loaves, consists in whiteness, joined to a smallness of grain; in the beauty being dry, hard, and somewhat transparent. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of sugar cells which we have described above refers to sugar once refined; but some more labour is necessary to produce how far double refined sugar. The principal difference in the other refined operation is this, the latter is clarified by white of eggs instead of blood, and fresh water in place of lime-water.\n\nSugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDY\">candy</a> is the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of the cane formed How into large crystals by a flow process. When the syrup sugar candy is well clarified, it is boiled a little, but not so much as is made, is done for the proof mentioned in the process for making common sugar. It is then placed in old moulds, having their lower ends stopped with linen, and crossed at little distances with small twigs to retain the sugar as it crystallizes. The moulds are then laid in a cool place. In proportion as the syrup cools crystals are formed. In about nine or ten days the moulds are carried to the stove, and placed in a pot; but the linen is not removed entirely, so that the syrup falls down slowly in drops. When the syrup has dropped away, and the crystals of the sugar-candy are become dry, the moulds are taken from the stove and broken in pieces, to disengage the sugar, which adheres strongly to the sides of the moulds. If the syrup has been coloured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, the crystals take a slight tinge of red; if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> has been mixed, they assume a bluish colour. If it be desired to have the candy perfumed, the essence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> may be dropped into the moulds along with the syrup.\n\nHaving now given some account of the method usually employed for refining sugar, it will not be im-\nproper to say a few things concerning its nature and its uses.\n\nSugar is soluble in water, and in a small degree in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>. When united with a small portion of water, it becomes fusible; from which quality the art of preserving is indebted for many of its preparations. It is phosphoric and combustible; when exposed to fire emitting a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> be slow, and a white flame if the combustion be rapid. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> it produces a quantity of phlegm, acid, oil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>. Bergman, in treating sugar with the nitrous acid, obtained a new acid now known by the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXOTIC\">exotic</a> acid: but he has omitted to mention the principles of which sugar is composed. Lavoisier, however, has supplied this omission; and after many experiments has assigned three principles in sugar, hydrogen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, and carbone. If the juice expressed from the sugar-cane be left to itself, it passes into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a> fermentation; and during the decomposition of the sugar, which is continued for three or four months, a great quantity of glutinous matter is separated. This matter when distilled gives a portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>. If the juice be exposed to the spirituous fermentation, a wine is obtained analogous to cider. If this wine, after being kept in bottles a year, be distilled, we obtain a portion of eau de vie.\n\nThe uses to which sugar are applied are indeed numerous and important: It can be made so solid as in the art of preserving to receive the most agreeable colours and the greatest variety of forms. It can be made so fluid as to mix with any soluble substance.\u2014It preserves the juice and substance of fruits in all countries and in all seasons. It affords a delicious seasoning to many kinds of food. It is useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a>, for it unites with medicines, and removes their disagreeable flavour: it is the basis of all syrups. M. Macquer has shown in a very satisfactory manner how useful sugar would be if employed in fermenting wines. Sugar has also been found a remedy for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCURVY\">scurvy</a>, and a valuable article of food in cases of necessity. M. Imbert de Lennes, first surgeon to the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, published the following story in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAZETTE\">Gazette</a> de Sant\u00e9, which confirms this assertion. A vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with sugar bound from the West Indies was becalmed in its passage for several days, during which the stock of provisions was exhausted. Some of the crew were dying of the scurvy, and the rest were threatened with a still more terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In this emergency recourse was had to the sugar. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, the symptoms of the scurvy went off, the crew found it a wholesome and substantial aliment, and returned in good health to France.\n\n\"Sugar (says Dr Ruth) affords the greatest quantity of nourishment in a given quantity of matter of any substance in nature; of course it may be preserved in less room in our houses, and may be consumed in less time, than more bulky and less nourishing aliment. It has this peculiar advantage over most kinds of aliment, that it is not liable to have its nutritious qualities affected by time or the weather; hence it is preferred by the Indians in their excursions from home. They mix a certain quantity of maple sugar, with an equal quantity of Indian corn, dried and powdered, in its milky state. This mixture is packed in little baskets, which are frequently wetted in travelling, without injuring the sugar. A few spoonfuls of it mixed with half a pint of spring water afford them a pleasant and strengthening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>.\n\nFrom the degrees of strength and nourishment which are conveyed into animal bodies by a small bulk of sugar, it might probably be given to horses with great advantage, when they are used in places or under circumstances which make it difficult or expensive to support them with more bulky or weighty aliment. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of sugar with grass or hay has supported the strength and spirits of a horse during a whole day's labour in one of the West-India islands. A larger quantity given alone has fattened horses and cattle, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> before last in Hispaniola, for a period of several months, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of sugar, and the importation of grain, were prevented by the want of ships.\n\n\"The plentiful use of sugar in diet is one of the best preventives that has ever been discovered of the diseases which are produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>. Nature seems to have implanted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for this aliment in all children, as if it were on purpose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> them from those diseases. Dr Ruth knew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, who early adopted this opinion, and who, by indulging a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of children in the use of sugar, has preserved them all from the diseases usually occasioned by worms.\n\n\"Sir John Pringle has remarked, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> has never been known in any country where sugar composes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> part of the diet of the inhabitants. Dr Ruth thinks it probable that the frequency of malignant fevers of all kinds has been lessened by this diet, and that its more general use would defend that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of people who are most subject to malignant fevers from being so often affected by them.\n\n\"In the numerous and frequent disorders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, which occur in all countries where the body is exposed to a variable temperature of weather, sugar affords the basis of many agreeable remedies. It is useful in weaknesses, and acid delusions upon other parts of the body. Many facts may be adduced in favour of this assertion. Dr Ruth mentions only one, which, from the venerable name of the person whose case furnished it, cannot fail of commanding attention and credit. Upon my inquiring of Dr Franklin, at the request of a friend (says our respectable author), about a year before he died, whether he had found any relief from the pain of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, the stone from the blackberry jam, of which he took large quantities, he told me that he had, but that he believed the medicinal part of the jam resided wholly in the sugar; and as a reason for thinking so, he added, that he often found the same relief by taking about half a pint of syrup, prepared by boiling a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> sugar in water, just before he went to bed, that he did from a dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPIUM\">opium</a>. It has been supposed by some of the early physicians of our country, that the sugar obtained from the maple-tree is more medicinal than that obtained from the West India sugar-cane; but this opinion I believe is without foundation. It is preferable in its qualities to the West India sugar only from its superior cleanliness.\n\n\"Cases may occur in which sugar may be required in medicine, or in diet, by persons who refuse to be benefited, even indirectly by the labour of slaves. In such cases the innocent maple sugar will always be preferred. It has been said, that sugar injures the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; but this opinion now has so few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, that it does not deserve a serious refutation.\"\nIn the account which we have given above of the method of cultivating and manufacturing sugar, we have had in our eye the plantations in the West Indies, where slaves alone are employed; but we feel a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in having it in our power to add a short description of the method used in the East Indies, because there sugar is manufactured by free men, on a plan which is much more economical than what is followed in the West Indies. The account which we mean to give is an extract from the report of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of Privy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> for trade on the subject of the African slave-trade, drawn up by Mr Batham. We shall give it in the author's own words.\n\n\"Having been for two years in the English and French West India islands, and since conducted sugar estates in the East Indies; before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of the slave-trade was agitated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, it may be desirable to know that sugar of a superior quality and inferior price to that in our islands is produced in the East Indies; that the culture of the cane, the manufacture of the sugar and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARRACK\">arrack</a>, is, with these material advantages, carried on by free people. China, Bengal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Malabar, all produce quantities of sugar and spirits; but as the most considerable growth of the cane is carried on near Batavia, I shall explain the improved manner in which sugar estates are there conducted. The proprietor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> is generally a wealthy Dutchman, who has erected on it substantial mills, boiling and curing houses. He rents this estate to a Chinese, who resides on it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERINTENDENT\">superintendent</a>; and this renter (supposing the estate to consist of 300 or more acres) relents it to free men in parcels of 50 or 60 on these conditions: 'That they shall plant it in canes, and receive so much per pecul of 133\u00bd pounds for every pecul of sugar that the canes shall produce.'\n\nWhen crop time comes on, the superintendent collects a sufficient number of persons from the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> or villages, and takes off his crop as follows. To any set of tradesmen who bring their carts and buffaloes he agrees to give such a price per pecul to cut all his crop of canes, carry them to the mill and grind them. A second to boil them per pecul. A third to clay them and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a> them for market per pecul. So that by this method of conducting a sugar estate the renter knows to a certainty what the produce of it will cost him per pecul. He has not any permanent or unnecessary expense; for when the crop is taken off, the taskmen return to their several pursuits in the towns and villages they came from; and there only remain the cane planters who are preparing the next year's crop. This like all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> arts, by being divided into several branches, renders the labour cheaper and the work more perfectly done.\n\nOnly clayed sugars are made at Batavia; these are in quality equal to the best from the West Indies, and are sold so low from the sugar estates as eighteen shillings sterling per pecul of 133\u00bd lbs. This is not the selling price to the trader at Batavia, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> there is arbitrary, and sugar subject to duties imposed at will. The Shabander exacts a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOLLAR\">dollar</a> per pecul on all sugar exported. The price of common labour is from 9d. to 10d. per day. By the method of carrying on the sugar estates, the taskmen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> considerably more than this not only from working extraordinary hours, but from being considered artists in their several branches. They do not make spirits sugar on the sugar estates. The molasses is sent for sale to Batavia, where one distillery may purchase the produce of an hundred estates. Here is a vast saving and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of the price of spirits; not as in the West Indies, a distillery, for each estate; many centre in one, and arrack is sold at Batavia from 21 to 25 rixdollars per leaguer of 160 gallons; say 8d. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLON\">gallon</a>.\"\n\nThe SUGAR MAPLE, (the acer saccharinum of Lin-Description), as well as the sugar-cane, produces a great quantity of sugar. This tree grows in great numbers in the western counties of all the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>. Those which grow in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a> yield the sugar in a greater quantity than those which grow on the waters of the Ohio.\u2014These trees are generally found mixed with the beech, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a>, white and water ash, the cucumber tree, linden, aspen, butternut, and wild cherry trees. They sometimes appear in groves covering five or six acres in a body, but they are more commonly interspersed with some or all of the forest trees which have been mentioned. From 30 to 50 trees are generally found upon an acre of ground. They grow only in the richest American soils, and frequently in stony ground. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">Springs</a> of the purest water abound in their neighbourhood. They are, when fully grown, as tall as the white and black oaks, vol. iii., and from two to three feet in diameter. They put forth a beautiful white blossom in the spring before they show a single leaf. The colour of the blossom distinguishes them from the acer rubrum, or the common maple, which affords a blossom of a red colour. The wood of the sugar maple-tree is extremely inflammable, and is preferred upon that account by hunters and surveyors for fire-wood. Its small branches are so much impregnated with sugar as to afford support to the cattle, horses, and sheep of the first settlers, during the winter, before they are able to cultivate forage for that purpose. Its ashes afford a great quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, exceeded by few, or perhaps by none, of the trees that grow in the woods of the United States. The tree is supposed to arrive at its full growth in the woods in twenty years.\n\nIt is not injured by tapping; on the contrary, the more often it is tapped, the more syrup is obtained from it. In this respect it follows a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of animal secretion. A single tree had not only survived, but flourished after syrup is obtained from the yearly discharge of sap from the tree, in improving and increasing the sap, are demonstrated from the superior excellence of those trees which have been perforated in an hundred places, by a small wood-pecker which feeds upon the sap. The trees, after having been wounded in this way, distil the remains of their juice on the ground, and afterwards acquire a black colour. The sap of these trees is much sweeter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> than that which is obtained from trees which have not been previously wounded, and it affords more sugar.\n\nFrom twenty-three gallons and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of sap, procured in twenty-four hours from only two of these dark coloured trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Noble, Esq. of the state of New York, obtained four pounds and thirteen ounces of good grained sugar.\n\nA tree of an ordinary size yields in a good season from twenty to thirty gallons of sap, from which are made from five to six pounds of sugar. To this there are sometimes\ntimes remarkable exceptions. Samuel Lowe, Esq., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of peace in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>, in the state of New York, informed Arthur Noble, Esq., that he had made twenty pounds and one ounce of sugar between the 14th and 23rd of April, in the year 1789, from a single tree that had been tapped for several successive years before.\n\nFrom the influence which culture has upon forest and other trees, it has been supposed, that by transplanting the sugar maple-tree into a garden, or by destroying such other trees as shelter it from the rays of the sun, the quantity of the sap might be increased, and its quality much improved. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a> county, in the state of Pennsylvania, planted a number of these trees above twenty years ago in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, from three gallons of the sap of which he obtains every year a pound of sugar. It was observed formerly, that it required five or six gallons of the sap of the trees which grow in the woods to produce the same quantity of sugar.\n\nThe sap diffuses from the wood in the spring months. Trees which have been cut down in the winter for the support of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals of the new settlers, yield a considerable quantity of sap as soon as their trunks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> feel the rays of the sun in the spring of the year. It is in consequence of the sap of these trees being equally diffused through every part of them, that they live three years after they are girdled, that is, after a circular incision is made through the bark into the substance of the tree for the purpose of destroying it. It is remarkable that grafts thrive better under this tree in a meadow, than in situations exposed to the constant action of the sun. The season for tapping the trees is in February, March, and April, according to the weather which occurs in these months.\n\nWarm days and frothy nights are most favourable to a plentiful discharge of sap. The quantity obtained in a day from a tree is from five gallons to a pint, according to the greater or less heat of the air. Mr. Lowe informed Arthur Noble, Esq., that he obtained near three and twenty gallons of sap in one day (April 14, 1789,) from the single tree which was before mentioned. Such instances of a profusion of sap in single trees are however not very common.\n\nThere is always a suspension of the discharge of sap in the night if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> succeed a warm day. The perforation in the tree is made with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-AXE\">axe</a> or an auger. The latter is preferred from experience of its advantages. The auger is introduced about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch, and in an ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> (that the sap may not be frozen in a slow current in the mornings or evenings), and is afterwards deepened gradually to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of two inches. A spout is introduced about half an inch into the hole made by this auger, and projects from three to twelve inches from the tree. The spout is generally made of the hawthorn or elder, which usually grows in the neighbourhood of the sugar trees. The tree is first tapped on the south side; when the discharge of its sap begins to lessen, an opening is made on the north side, from which an increased discharge takes place. The sap flows from four to six weeks, according to the temperature of the weather. Troughs large enough to contain three or four gallons made of white pine, or white ash, or of dried water ash, aspen, linden, poplar, or common maple, are placed under the spout to receive the sap, which is carried every day to a large receiver, made of either of the trees before mentioned. From this receiver it is conveyed, after being strained, to the boiler.\n\nWe understand that there are three modes of reducing the sap to sugar; by evaporation, by freezing, and by boiling; of which the latter is most general, as being the most expeditious. We are farther assured, that the profit of the maple tree is not confined to its sugar. It affords most agreeable melodies, and an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>. The sap which is suitable for these purposes is obtained after the sap which affords the sugar has ceased to flow, so that the manufacturers of these different products of the maple tree, by succeeding, do not interfere with each other. The melodies may be made to compose the basis of a pleasant summer beer. The sap of the maple is moreover capable of affording a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>; but we hope this precious juice will never be prostituted to this ignoble purpose. Should the use of sugar in diet become more general in this country (says Dr. Rush) it may tend to lessen the inclination or supposed necessity for spirits, for I have observed a relish for sugar in diet to be seldom accompanied by a love for strong drink.\n\nThere are several other vegetables raised in our own country which afford sugar; as beet-roots, skirrets, parsnips, potatoes, celery, red cabbage stalks, the young shoots of Indian wheat. The sugar is most readily obtained from these, by making a tincture of the subject in rectified spirit of wine; which, when saturated by heat, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> the sugar upon standing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>.\n\nSugar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">Milk</a>.
