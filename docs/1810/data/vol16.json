[{"h":"BEFORE MAN HAD RECOURSE TO AGRICULTURE AS THE MOST CERTAIN","t":"e <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> had recourse to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> as the most certain means of procuring subsistence, our acquaintance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> substances was principally that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> historian; confining a knowledge of their fitness for food, medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, their places of growth or habitation, and the means of procuring them, depending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> their manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. It required a studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to these circumstances to give agriculture its appearance after men had been in the practice of keeping flocks; by which means they were more at their leisure, and had some leisure to attend to the objects around them, and in particular to these circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> which affected the growth of their pasture.\n\nWhen agriculture and rude medicine were thus established, they were the first arts which had their foundation in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of laws, by which the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> were observed to be regulated; and with these arts we may begin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of nature, which was thus divided into two different branches.\n\nThe rude physician would be at first a collector of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFICS\">specifics</a>; but by degrees he would observe resemblances among the operations of his drugs, and would classify them according to these resemblances. He would thus come to attend less to the drug than to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of operation, and would naturally speculate concerning the connection between the operation and the economy of animal life. His art now becomes a scientific system, connected by principle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, all proceeding on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of changes produced by one kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> on another, but all out of sight. The frequent recourse to the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> for medicines would cause him to attend much more minutely to the few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> which he has occasion to study than the husbandman can do to the multitude he is obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a>. The physician must learn to think, the husbandman to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> between the economy of animal and vegetable life could hardly fail to engage the attention of the physician, and would make him a botanist, both as a classifier of plants and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>.\n\nHe would naturally expect to unite the services of his drugs by combining them in his recipes, and would be surprised at his disappointments. Curious and unexpected changes would frequently occur in his manipulations: the sensible qualities, and even the external appearances of his simples, would be often changed, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a>; and their medicinal properties would frequently vanish from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, and new ones be induced. These are curious, and to him interesting facts; and he would naturally be inquisitive af-\nter the principles which regulate these changes. His skill in this would by degrees extend beyond the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> for the knowledge; and the more curious speculation would lay the foundations of a most extensive and important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, comprehending all the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and mixture.\n\nAlong with this, and springing from the same source, another science must arise, contemplating the appearances of animal and vegetable life, and founded on a careful observation and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the wonderful machine. The most inquisitive of men have in all ages been affected by the displays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and contrivance in the bodies of animals, and immediately engaged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> into the uses and functions of their various parts and organs. The phenomena have been gradually discriminated and arranged under the various heads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, secretion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a>, rejection, growth, life, decay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the doctrines which have with greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> been established on these subjects, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of medicines, and the whole practice of physic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a>, has been established in the form of a liberal or scientific art.\n\nThe husbandman in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> must labour the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> which lies before him. He, too, is greatly interested in the knowledge of the vegetable economy, and forms some systems on the subject by which he regulates his labours: but he feels, that whatever is the nature of vegetable life, he must work hard, and he searches about for every thing which can tend to diminish his labour. The properties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, the wedge, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, soon become familiar to him; and without being able to tell on what their efficacy depends, he uses them with a certain sagacity and effect. The strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, the pressure and force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, are daily seen and employed by him and other artisans who labour for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> accommodation; and some rude principles on these subjects are committed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. Many tools and simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> are by this time familiar; and thus the general properties of matter, and the general laws of the actions of bodies on each other, become gradually matter of observation and reflection; and the practical mechanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be frequently improving his tools and machines. The general aim is to produce a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of work by the same exertion. The attempts to improvement will be awkward, and frequently unsuccessful. When a man finds, that by increasing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of his lever he increases his power of overcoming a resistance, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of curiosity is sufficient to make him inquire in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> his advantage increases. When he finds that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> length gives him a double energy, he will be surprised and mortified to find, that at the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> he has not performed twice the quantity of work: but, after much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, he will learn that every increase of energy, by means of a machine, is nearly compensated by an increase of time in the performance of his task; and thus one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> and leading principles of practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> was inculcated in a manner not to be forgotten, and the practical mechanic was brought to speculate about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and force, and by gradual and easy steps the general laws of simple motions were established.\n\nIt is evident that these speculations cannot be carried on, nor any considerable knowledge acquired, without some acquaintance with the art of measurement: and the very questions which the mechanic wishes to solve, presuppose some advances in this art, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time refined itself into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> of all the sciences. All the phenomena of sensible motion afford employment to the mathematician. It is performed in a double or triple time, through a double or triple space, by a double or triple body, by the exertion of a double or triple force, produces a double or triple effect, is more to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or to the left, upwards or downwards, &c. In short, every affection of motion is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>. Such a science must have appeared ere now in the form of an art, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the mutual transactions of men. These among an uncultivated people are chiefly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARTER\">barter</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> I want corn from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, and have nothing to give for it but the cloth which I have made, we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on some way of adjusting our terms in respect of the quantity. We should soon discover that the length, and breadth, and depth, of the box or bag, were equally important; and it was not difficult to see, that if any of them were doubled or tripled, the quantity of grain would be so too; if two of them were doubled, the grain would be quadrupled; and if all the three were doubled the quantity of grain would be increased eight times: the same thing would be observed with respect to my cloth. By such transactions as these, a few of the properties of plane and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> numbers and figures would become known, and the operations of multiplication and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> is combined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>; and daily observation shows us, that the more arbitrary properties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, which to the generality of mankind are so insignificant, lay hold on the fancy of some individuals with such force, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> them from every other intellectual entertainment, and are studied with a keenness and perseverance almost unequalled in any other walk of science. To most men the performance of a machine is a more attractive object than the properties of a figure, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of a figure more entertaining than that of a number; but the fact seems to have been otherwise. Before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> had invented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> that bears his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 15, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> H), and which is among the first elements of geometry, he had reformed the Grecian music by the addition of a note to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, and this addition proceeds on a very refined speculation on the properties of numbers; so that among the Greeks arithmetic must have made considerable progress, while geometry was yet in its cradle: and we know to what astonishing length they prosecuted the science of pure geometry, while their knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> principles was almost nothing. Also the Arabs hardly made any addition to the geometry of the Greeks, if they did not rather almost completely forget it; whilst they improved their arithmetic into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a>, the most refined and abstracted branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge. There is such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, in point of simplicity, between pure mathematics and the most elementary mechanics, that the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make rapid steps to improvement in more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, while the latter languished in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, and hardly deserved the name of science till very lately, when the great demand for it, by the increase and improvement in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, both interested many in the study, and facilitated its progress, by the multitude of machines which were contriving on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> by the manufacturers and artisans: and even at present it must\nbe acknowledged, that it is to them that we are indebted for almost every new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> in mechanics, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> has done more than improve the invention, by exhibiting its principles, and thus enabling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> to correct its imperfections; and now science and art go <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in hand, mutually giving and receiving affluence. The demands of the navigator for mathematical and astronomical knowledge have dignified these sciences; and they are no longer the means of elegant amusement alone, but merit the munificence of princes, who have erected observatories, and furnished voyages of discovery, where the mathematical sciences are at the same time cherished and applied to the most important purposes.\n\nThis short sketch of what may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of physical sciences will not, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, be thought improper or unprofitable. It tends to confirm an assertion often alluded to, that the prosecution of the study of nature will be more successful, if we imitate her mode of proceeding, and divide the labour. It will be still further confirmed by attending to the scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the phenomena, which marks out a different mode of proceeding, and a difference in the knowledge which we shall ultimately acquire, after our most successful researches.\n\nIn both classes of phenomena already distinguished (No. 6.) we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, that the principle which connects the pairs of concomitant events, rendering the one the inseparable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of the other, is totally unknown to us, because it is not the immediate object of our perception.\n\nBut in the phenomena of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, we see the immediate exertion of this principle, whatever it may be; we can observe the exertion with accuracy; we can determine its kind and degree, which are the signs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the kind and degree of the unperceived cause. This exertion, being always some modification of motion, allows us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of mathematical knowledge, and thus to ascertain with the precision peculiar to that science the energy of the cause, judging of the tendency and quantity by the tendency and the quantity of the observed effect.\n\nBut in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> class of phenomena the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is very different. In the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, for instance, the immediate exertion of the cause is not perceived: all that we observe is the affinage of particles which obtains before mixture, and that which takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> when it is completed, and which we consider as its result. The procedure of nature in producing the change is unseen and unknown. The steps are hid from our observation. We are not only ignorant of the cause which determines one particle of our food to become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of our body while others are rejected, but we do not see the operation. We are not only ignorant of the cause which determines a particle of vitriolic acid to quit the fossil alkali with which it is united in Glauber <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, and to attach itself to a particle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> already united with the muriatic acid, which also quits it to unite with the alkali, but we do not see the operation. The particles and their motions are not the objects of our senses; and all that we see is the Epsom salt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> salt separated from the water in which we had formerly dissolved the sal mirabile and the muriated magnesia. The motions, which are the immediate effects of the changing causes, and therefore their only indications, characteri-\n\nVol. XVI. Part II.\nthey have been such as, if allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in a way analogous to what we observe in the sensible motions of bodies, would produce effects totally different from those which are observed. These atomic theories, as they are called, transgress every rule of philosophical discussion, and even the best of them are little better than trifling amusements. By far the greatest part of them only serve to raise a smile of pity and contempt in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> at all acquainted with mechanical philosophy. Whenever we see an author attempting to explain these hidden operations of nature by invisible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, by ethers, by collisions, and vibrations, and particularly if we see him introducing mathematical reasonings into such explanations\u2014the best thing we can do is to shut the book, and take to some other subject. That we may not be thought to speak presumptuously on this occasion, we only beg leave to remind our readers, that the united knowledge of the most eminent mathematicians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> has not yet been able to give anything more than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to the solution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of three bodies; that is, to determine with accuracy the motions of three particles of matter acting on each other in the simplest of all possible manners, viz. by forces varying as the squares of the distances inversely: and the vibrations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> bodies, of any but the very simplest possible forms, are to this day beyond the reach of investigation. What then should be our expectations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where millions of particles are acting at once, of forms unobserved, and with forces unknown, and where the object is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> result of many, where the precise state of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> particle need not be known, but where it is this very precise state of each single particle that we want to know? What can it be but uncertainty and mistake?\n\nNotwithstanding these discouraging circumstances, we must observe that this kind of inquiry has greatly improved of late years, along with the improvement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of mathematical philosophy, and since philosophers have given over their incipient attempts to explain every thing by impulse; and we need not despair of making still farther advances, if we will content ourselves with going no farther than Newton has done in his explanation of the planetary motions. He has immortalized his own name, and has added immensely to our stock of useful knowledge: yet he has stopped short at the discovery of the fact of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>; and all who have endeavoured to explain or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for this fact have only exposed themselves to pity. We may perhaps be one day able to demonstrate from the phenomena that the particles of matter have certain mutual tendencies to or from each other, exerted according to fixed or invariable rules; and from these tendencies we may be able to explain many other phenomena, and predict the consequences, with as much certainty and evidence as an astronomer calculates a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a>. This would be a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, and perhaps more is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>: and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to this has been hinted by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, who has expressed his suspicion, that as the great movements of the solar system are regulated by universal gravitation, so the mutual actions of the particles of matter are produced and regulated by tendencies of a similar kind, equally but not more inexplicable, and of which the laws of action are to be discovered by as careful an attention to the phenomena, and by the same patient thinking, which he has employed on the planetary motions. And a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to this new and almost unbounded field of inquiry has been given us by the celebrated Abb\u00e9 Bofcovitch, in his Theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a>, where he has shown how such mutual tendencies, similar in every ultimate particle of matter, and modified by conditions that are highly probable, nay almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRABLE\">demonstrable</a>, will not only produce the sensible forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCTILITY\">ductility</a>, fluidity, and vapour, under an inconceivable variety of subordinate appearances, and the observed laws of sensible motion, but will go far to explain the phenomena of fusion, congelation, solution, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, &c., &c., &c., both in chemistry and physiology. We earnestly recommend this work to the perusal of all who wish to obtain a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of natural bodies, and of the way in which the uniting forces produce their ultimate and sensible effects. Any person, possessed of a moderate share of mathematical knowledge, will be convinced that the process of nature is not very different from what he describes; and that much of what we observe must happen as he says, even although the ultimate atoms of matter are not inextensible mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, accompanied with attracting and repelling forces.\n\nBut we have many steps to make before we begin this Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> study: Nature opens to us an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>; and we cannot doubt that our posterity will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> find employment in the pursuit, even though advancing with the eager heads and heels of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. We have not yet arrived at the threshold in many parts of this research; and are uncertain with respect to the phenomena themselves, which are to be the subjects of this discussion. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of bodies must be fully understood before we begin to speak of the forces which unite their particles, or speculate about their modes of action. As long as water was considered as an element, we were ignorant of the forces inherent in its particles; we are perhaps still ignorant of this; but we now know that they are extremely different from what we formerly supposed them to be. It is but in a very few, if in any, cases of chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, that we even know what are the ingredients: till we know this, it is too soon to speculate about their mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>. Our ignorance in the real events in the animal and vegetable economy is still greater. Our first task therefore is to proceed, as we are now doing, in the accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> and classification of the phenomena themselves; and, without attempting to bring them within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> of mathematical philosophy, by attempting what are called mechanical explanations, let us give up the consideration of these hidden operations, and augment to the utmost our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of secondary laws of visible but remote connections. All the mechanical speculations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Robert Boyle about the sensible qualities of things are now forgotten; but his chemical experiments preserve all their value, and are frequently referred to. The same may be said of the sagacious Dr Hales, whose fanciful notions of internal conflicts, and collisions, and vibrations, derogate nothing from the value of the curious facts which he has established both in the animal and vegetable economy.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> in the nature of the phenomena, and this difference in the nature of the knowledge which is to be acquired, and the means which are to be employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\nployed for the successful prosecution of these two branches of general physics, has occasioned a still farther restriction (at least in Britain) of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It is particularly applied to the study of the phenomena of the first class, while those of the second have produced the sciences of CHEMISTRY and PHYSIOLOGY.\n\nNatural philosophy and chemistry have generally been made particular institutions in our seminaries of learning, but physiology has more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> been taught in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with anatomy, medicine, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>.\n\nThe phenomena of the first class have been usually called MECHANICAL, in order to distinguish them from those observed in the operations of chemistry, and in the animal and vegetable economy; and the explanations which have been attempted of some of the last, by applying the laws observed in the phenomena of the first class, have been called mechanical explanations.\n\nAs this first class is evidently but a part of general physics, there is some impropriety in giving the name natural philosophy to a course of doctrines which is confined to these alone. Indeed at the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, the lectures given in the Schola Physica were much more extensive, comprehending almost all the phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> world; but as all arts and sciences have improved most where the labour has been most divided, it was found more conducive to the advancement of knowledge that separate institutions should be founded for the studies of natural history, chemistry, physiology, &c.; and thus the phenomena purely mechanical, and a few others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, which either were susceptible of mathematical treatment, or had little connection with the studies of chemistry and physiology, were left to the care of the professor of natural philosophy.\n\nAs the terms chemistry and physiology have been applied to two very important branches of general physics, we think that a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> or characteristic name might be appropriated to the other, and that it might very properly be termed MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nIt only remains to make a few observations on the distinctive means of prosecuting these studies with success, and to point out some of the advantages which may reasonably be expected from a careful prosecution of them: and as the second branch has been fully treated under the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of Chemistry, Physiology, &c., we shall confine ourselves to what is usually called NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nMechanical Philosophy may, in conformity with the foregoing observations, be defined, \"the study of the sensible motions of the bodies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, and of their actions producing sensible motions, with the view to discover their causes, to explain subordinate phenomena, and to improve art.\"\n\nThe principle upon which all philosophical discussion proceeds is, that every change which we observe in the condition of things is considered by us as an effect, indicating the agency, characterising the kind, and measuring the degree, of its cause.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of mechanical philosophy, the cause of any change of motion is called a moving or changing force.\n\nThe disquisitions of natural philosophy must therefore begin with the consideration of motion, carefully noticing every affection or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of it, so as to establish marks and measures of every change of which it is susceptible; for these are the only marks and measures of the changing forces. This being done, it only remains to apply them to the motions which we observe in the universe.\n\nFrom the general principle of philosophical discussion already mentioned, there flow directly two axioms.\n\n1. Every body perseveres in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, or of uniform rectilineal motion, unless affected by some moving force.\n\n2. Every change of motion is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> and in the degree of the force impressed.\n\nThese are usually called the LAWS OF MOTION. They are more properly laws of human judgment, with respect to motion. Perhaps they are necessary truths, unless it be alleged that the general principle, of which they are necessary consequences, is itself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> though universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\nBy these two axioms, applied in abstracto to every variety of motion, we establish a system of general doctrines concerning motions, according as they are simple or compound, accelerated, retarded, rectilineal, curvilinear, in single bodies, or in systems of connected bodies; and we obtain corresponding characteristics and measures of accelerating or retarding forces, centripetal or centrifugal, simple or compound.\n\nWe have an illustrious example of this abstract system of motion and moving forces in the first book of Sir Isaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Euler's Mechanica seu Scientia Motus, Herman's Phononima seu de Viribus Corporum, and D'Alembert's Trait\u00e9 de Dynamique, are also excellent works of the same kind. In this abstract system no regard is paid to the casual differences of moving forces, or the sources from which they arise. It is enough to characterise a double accelerating force, for instance, that it produces a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>. It may be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, a stream of water, the pressure of a man; and the force, of which it is said to be double, may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of a magnet, a current of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, or the action of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>.\n\nHaving established these general doctrines, the philosopher now applies them to the general phenomena of the universe, in order to discover the nature of the forces which really exist, and the laws by which their operations are regulated, and to explain interesting but subordinate phenomena. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> business of the mechanical philosopher; and it may with some propriety be called the mechanical history of nature.\n\nSome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> must be followed in this history of mechanical nature. The phenomena must be classified by arrangement of their resemblances, which infer a resemblance in their causes, and these classes must be arranged according to some principle. We have seen no method which appears to us less exceptionable than the following:\n\nThe principle of arrangement is the generality of the phenomena; and the propriety of adopting this principle, arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> which it gives us of more readily discovering the most general actuating forces, whose agency is implicated in all other phenomena of arrangement.\nMechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; and therefore should be previously discussed, that we may detect the discriminating circumstances which serve to characterize the subordinate phenomena, and are thus the marks of the distinguishing and inferior natural powers.\n\nThe most general of all phenomena is the curvilinear motion of bodies in free space; it is observed through first applied the whole extent of the solar system.\n\nThe mechanical history of nature begins therefore with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>. Here, from the general phenomena of the planetary motions, is evinced the fact of the mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a> of every body towards every other body, and this in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> proportion of the squares of the distance, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> proportion of the quantity of matter. This is the fact of universal gravitation, indicating the agency, and measuring the intensity, of the universal force of mutual gravity.\n\nHaving established this as an universal fact, the natural philosopher proceeds to point out all the particular facts which are comprehended under it, and whose peculiarities characterize the different movements of the solar system. That is, in the language of philosophy, he gives a theory or explanation of the subordinate phenomena; the elliptical motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>, their mutual disturbances; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> irregularities; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLATE\">oblate</a> figure of the planets; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTATION\">nutation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>; the precession of the equinoxes; and the phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> and trade winds; and he concludes with the theory of the parabolic motion of bodies projected on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of this globe, and the motion of pendulums.\n\nAs he goes along, he takes notice of the applications which may be made to the arts of life of the various doctrines which are successively established; such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, astronomical calculation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALLING\">dialling</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNNERY\">gunnery</a>, and the measuring of time.\n\nIf a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> parcel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> be lying on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, and the finger be applied to any part of it to push it along the table, that part is removed where you will, but the rest remains in its place; but if it is a piece of sandstone of the same materials and shape, and the finger is applied as before, the whole is moved; the other parts accompany the part impelled by the finger in all its motions.\n\nFrom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>'s accompanying the earth in all its motions round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, we infer a moving force which connects the moon and earth. In like manner, we must conclude that a moving force connects the particles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; for we give the name force to every thing which produces motion: We call it the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>; a term which, like gravitation, expresses merely a fact.\n\nThis seems to be the next phenomenon of the universe in point of extent.\n\nHaving, from the general phenomenon, established the existence of this force, the philosopher proceeds to ascertain the laws by which its exertions are regulated; which is the ascertaining its distinctive nature and properties. This he does in the same way that he ascertained the nature of planetary gravitation, viz. by observing more particularly the various phenomena.\n\nHere is opened a most extensive and varied field of observation, in which it must be acknowledged that very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and marked progress has been made. The variety in the phenomena, and the consequent variety in the nature of the connecting forces, appear as yet inconceivably great; and there seems little probability of our being able to detect in them all any familiars, combined with the other distinguishing circumstances, as we have done in the case of gravity. Yet we should not despair. Bolzovich has shown, in the most unexceptionable manner, that although we shall suppose that every atom of matter is endowed with a perfectly similar force, acting in a certain determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the small and imperceptible distances at which the particles of matter are arranged with respect to each other, the external or sensible appearances may, and must, have all that variety which we observe. He also shows very distinctly how, from the operation of this force, must arise some of the most general and important phenomena which characterize the different forms of tangible bodies.\n\nWe observe the chief varieties of the action of this corpuscular force on the bodies which we denominate hard, soft, solid, fluid, vaporous, brittle, ductile, elastic. We see instances where the parts of bodies avoid each other, and require external force to keep them together, or at certain small distances from each other. This is familiar in air, vapours, and all compressible and elastic bodies.\n\nThis is evidently a most curious and interesting subject of investigation. On the nature and action of these corpuscular forces depends the strength or firmness of solids, their elasticity, their power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> motion, the pressure, and motion, and impulse of fluids; nay, on the same actions depend all the chemical and physiological phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, fusion, congelation, vaporization, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a>, solution, precipitation, absorption, secretion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, and animal and vegetable conception and assimilation.\n\nOut of this immense store of phenomena, this inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of employment for our powers of investigation, the natural philosopher selects those which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> directly to the production or modification of sensible motion.\n\nHe will therefore consider,\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion among detached and free bodies, establishing the laws of impulse or collision. This has always been considered as the elementary doctrine of mechanical philosophy, and as the most familiar been fact observed in the material world; and in all ages thought the philosophers have been anxious to reduce all actions of most familiar bodies on each other to impulse, and have never thought it a fact till it has been shown to be a case of impulse. This it is which has given rise to the hypotheses of vortices, ethers, magnetic and electric fluids, animal spirits, and a multitude of fancied intermediaries between the sensible masses of matter, which are said in common language to act on each other. A heavy body is supposed to fall, because it is impelled by a stream of an invisible fluid moving according to certain conditions suited to the case. The filings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> are supposed to be arranged round a magnet, by means of a stream of magnetic fluid issuing from one pole, circulating perpetually round the magnet, and entering at the other pole, in the same manner as we observe the flore-grafs arranged by the current of a brook.\n\nBut the philosopher who has begun the mechanical study of nature by the abstract doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">dynamics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is and made its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the celestial phenomena, and who has attended carefully to the many analogies.\nMechanical logics between the phenomena of gravitation and cohesion, will be at least ready to entertain very different notions of this matter. He will be so far from thinking that the production of motion by impulse is the most familiar fact in nature, that he will acknowledge it to be comparatively very rare; nay, there are some appearances in the facts, which are usually considered as instances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a>, which will lead him to doubt, and almost to deny, that there has ever been observed an instance of one body putting another in motion by coming into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> contact with it, and striking it; and he will be disposed to think that the production of motion in this case is precisely similar to what we observe when we gently push one floating magnet towards another, with their similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> facing each other. There will be the same production of motion in the one and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of it in the other, and the same uniform motion of the common centre of gravity: and, in this case of the magnets, he feels completely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of motion, which is not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, but is observed through the whole of nature, and which receives no explanation from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of an intervening fluid, but is even totally inconsistent with them. We mean, \"that every action of one body on another is accompanied by an equal and opposite action of that other on the first.\" This is usually called the equality of action and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a>: it is not intuitive, but it is universal; and it is a necessary consequence of the perfect similarity of the corporeal forces of the same kinds of matter. This general fact, unaccountable on the hypothesis of impelling fluids, is considered in the planetary motions as the unequivocal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of the sameness of that gravity which regulates them all. The rules of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> should make us draw the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> here, that the particles of tangible matter are connected by equal and mutual forces, which are the immediate causes of all their sensible actions, and that these forces, like gravitation, vary with every change of distance and situation.\n\nThe laws of collision and impulsion being now established, either as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> facts or as consequences of the agency of equal and mutual forces which connect the particles of matter, the philosopher considers,\n\n2. The production of motion by the intervention of solid bodies, where, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of the cohesion of matter, some of the motions are necessarily confined to certain determinate paths or directions. This is the case in all motions round fixed points or axes, or along planes or curves which are oblique to the action of the forces.\n\nThis part of the study contains the theory of machines, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out the principles on which their energy depends, and consequently furnishing maxims for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and improvement. But these observations do not complete the discussion of the mechanism of solid bodies: they are not only solid and inert, but they are also heavy; therefore the action of gravity must be combined with the consequences of solidity. This will lead to discussions about the centre of gravity, the theory and construction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> and roofs, the principles of stability and equilibrium, the attitudes of animals, and many particulars of this kind.\n\n3. The philosopher will now turn his attention to another form, in which tangible matter exhibits many interesting phenomena, viz. FLUIDITY. The first thing to be attended to here is, What is that particular form of existence? What is the precise phenomenon which characterizes fluidity? What is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of a fluid?","sp":29,"ep":35},{"h":"END OF THE SIXTEENTH VOLUME","t":"DIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES OF VOL.

On examining the writings of the earliest philosophers, we meet with little more than a collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> principles and hypothetical reasonings, especially previous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>. He considered man as a microcosm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> an epitome of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, in which were produced the same phenomena as in the larger world, only to a less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. He admitted more than one intelligent principle, conducing all the operations of the human body. He supposed that the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> nourished by the blood, fixed by the veins, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, as so many visible situations, became obedient to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>. He did not pretend that the eternal power of numbers had prefabricated all the phenomena of nature, and that the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> harmonies regulated the motions of the bodies which filled the universe, though he has been made so to express himself by his disciples. He was contented with asserting, that every thing in nature was brought about according to the qualities and proportions of numbers, without attributing to them an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and a positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. He perceived that the phenomena of the animal economy succeeded each other with a strict regularity, by which they concurred in maintaining order; and in this order he found the principle of the existence and preservation of all beings; a principle without which they could not exist. He considered the souls of men as emanations from the general soul of the universe, or anima mundi.\n\nAlcmaeon considered the brain as the seat of the soul. He supposed found to be produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERBERATION\">reverberation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> within the cavity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>; and he thought that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> was owing to the moisture of the tongue.

According to him, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the blood was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and he supposed that the stagnation of this fluid in the veins produced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> brought back the waking state of the body. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">Health</a> consisted in the equilibrium and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> proportioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> qualities; and that whenever any of these became too predominant, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMPEDOCLES\">Empedocles</a> involved himself in a multitude of absurd hypotheses, in order to explain the formation of man, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the elements from which he was produced. He too, like the disciples of Pythagoras, sought among the properties of numbers, for the general principles both of physical and moral science. In uniformity with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> it was, that he reckoned the four elements, and admitted among the particles of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> principles a kind of affection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>, of desire and antipathy, capable of separating and reuniting them, as occasion might require. He believed that respiration commenced within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UTERUS\">uterus</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> was provided from each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> with certain organic particles, which tended to unite into one uniform whole. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a>, convinced that we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the arrangement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to the intelligence of a superintending being, imagined that the body of every animal was formed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a> particles, which were brought together by a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>. It appeared to him, that bodies which were endowed with thought, were composed of sensible elements; that these elements remained unalterable, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> power in nature could exert any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> on them.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a> dedicated his life to repeated experiments on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals. He explained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> phenomena of organized bodies by the action and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of atoms, which he supposed to be endowed with powers essentially active, and susceptible of repelling and attracting each other. According to him, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> consisted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of homogeneous atoms. He conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> inherent in the elements of the body to be the sole active principle with which man was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>; and that by increase of this he became capable of life and motion. He compared the organs of the senses to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a>, on which were painted the images of things, and he reduced all sensations to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of feeling, which he supposed to be more or less delicate according to circumstances.\n\nThese philosophers, who lived before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, had, as we see, but very rude and indistinct notions of the animal economy; nor were those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> father of physic much superior. Excellent as was his practice, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> his knowledge of the symptoms and progress of diseases, the physiology of Hippocrates was very lame and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. He seems, indeed, to have understood the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a> better than most others; he traces the aliment into the stomach, seems aware of the processes it has to undergo there, and hazards a conjecture that part of the chyle is taken up immediately by the pores of the cellular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>; and that the juices admitted into this membrane, served for the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, the matter of which is afterwards transported, and laid up within the breasts. He attributes to each vital part an attractive force, which it exerts on the nutritious particles, in order to incorporate and appropriate to itself those which bear to it a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>. He thought that the heat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in a living body was kept up entirely by the powers of vitality; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air introduced by respiration, served rather to check it, by exerting a cooling effect on the pulmonary organs. He represents the human body as agitated in all its parts by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFLUX\">reflux</a>, which carried the matters from within outwards, or brought them from without inwards. From this some have supposed that he understood the circulation of the blood, a supposition made two hundred years ago, and lately again brought forward by the French physiologists. We shall not at present lay to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, which, however, we conceive to be founded on very unsatisfactory arguments.\n\nAfter Hippocrates, the science of man was again left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of philosophy, from which he had first separated it. Plato is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> whose opinions merit particular notice. He wrote on the physiology of man, with his accustomed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and splendor of diction; and he assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of an inspired prophet in describing, with the force of enthusiasm, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> images that suggested themselves to his mind. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">Accord</a>-\nAccording to him, the human body does not contain within itself the cause of the phenomena which are the consequence or the attendants of life. It is only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> subject, on which the soul expresses the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of its functions, like the canvas on which the painter traces the conceptions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. He distinguishes two principles of action in man, a rational soul, on which depend reflection and intelligence, and an irrational soul, on which depend life and motion. The latter is diffused through every part of the body; and it is by means of these parts that it feels, suffers pain, or enjoys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. Thus it is by means of the heart it is susceptible of courage and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> of desire. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is the seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and especially the heart, the seat of strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>; the lungs, the general coolers of the body. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the irrational soul, which possesses an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> for food, and all the necessary refreshments of the body, resides in the epigastric region; which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Plato, is a sort of stable, in which resides a voracious animal. During nutrition, the vital parts assimilate to their substance the aliment which are presented to them; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a> is the consequence of an affinity that takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between these parts and the nutritious juices. He thus seems to regard nutrition as the effect of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> between the aliments and the parts of the animal. A young animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> receive more nourishment than one which is old, because the force of its body has more effect in overcoming the force of the nutritious substances.\n\nAs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> action of the soul and the body on each other did not appear to him capable of being explained on the supposition of immateriality, he proposed the idea of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLASTIC_NATURE\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTIC\">plastic</a> nature, which he supposed to be an intermediate principle connecting the soul and the body.\n\nThe human body, which is entirely spongy, is exposed through every part to opposite currents of air and fire, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> and penetrate it, being introduced alternately by the lungs and by the skin. Hot, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, dense, rare, and the other sensible properties of bodies, are only the causes of the phenomena which we perceive, and are, as it were, the occasions or accidents that are required to keep in play the intelligent force disseminated through nature.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Plato, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time disputed with him the palm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and celebrity; but, as his physiological doctrines differed very little from those of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, it is unnecessary to detail them, except to remark, that he attributed to the soul three faculties, a nutritive, a sensitive, and a rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>; in the first of which life is the only principle; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, feeling is produced; and the third is peculiar to man, and is that part of him which knows or judges. This part is either an active or a passive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, of which the first may be separated from the body, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a>; whereas the second perishes together with the body. Life, according to this philosopher, is a permanence of the soul, retained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> heat, the principle of which resides in the heart.\n\nAbout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> which we are now considering, philosophy was divided into two feuds; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIALISTS\">materialists</a>, who attributed the formation of all beings to the fortuitous concourse of atoms; and the spiritualists, who held that the soul enjoyed an existence anterior to that of the body, which was no other than a passive organ, in which the phenomena that previously existed in the soul, in an abstract, latent manner, became evident and sensible. To the former feet belonged Democritus and Epicurus; to the latter, Zeno and Plato.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a> school, though they did much for the improvement of anatomy, added little to physiology. Of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEROPHILUS\">Herophilus</a> brought to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> the doctrine of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, and seems to have understood the action of the pulmonary organs more correctly than his predecessors, attributing to them a sort of natural appetite, by which they attracted and rejected the matter of respiration. He considered the nerves, the muscles, and the arteries, as the moving powers of the body.\n\nIn Galen, also a disciple of this school, we find the most scientific physiologist that has yet come under our notice. He seems first to have ascertained by experiment, that the arteries contain blood, and not air, as had been the opinion of Herophilus and his predecessors; and that they possessed a moving force, independent of that which the heart exercises on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of blood, and he found that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the heart always alternated with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a>. He even tried some delicate experiments, in order to ascertain the influence of the nervous system upon the sensitive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> powers of the body, by which he found, that when a nerve was intercepted with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a>, the part to which it led became deprived of sense and motion. He believed that the stomach, in a state of contraction, applied itself to the aliment that had been taken in; that the mesenteric veins absorbed a portion of the chyle prepared in the intestines; that the ductus choledochus carried the bile from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a> bladder into the duodenum; that the kidneys separated a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>; and he supposed, that another part of this fluid palled immediately from the stomach to the bladder, through some unknown passage. He believed that the lungs transmitted to the blood contained within them, an aerial principle, destined to free them from fuliginous vapours, and to temper the excesses of heat generated within the body. The obscure function of generation did not entirely escape his researches; and he made some curious attempts to find out how the sexual organs prepared the seminal fluid, and how this acted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>.\n\nFor more respecting the doctrines of Galen, see the History of Medicine.\n\nThe commencement of the 13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> is the epoch of a material revolution in physiology. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> having penetrated into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, soon exerted its influence on most of the sciences, and especially on those connected with medicine, the doctrines of which were totally changed from their ancient simplicity, and became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a> of the most wild and fanciful opinions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALENISTS\">Galenists</a> sunk into oblivion; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> qualities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> faculties of the ancient school gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the fermentations and effervescences of the chemists. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBERTUS_MAGNUS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBERTUS\">Albertus</a> Magnus and Roger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, when they introduced the science of chemistry, scarcely dreamed of applying it to medicine; but Arnoldus de Villa Nova undertook this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, and fought for the foundation of medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> amid the processes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>. Paracelsus followed, and surpassed him in this chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>. An enlightened chemist and a credulous\ncredulous astrologer, his head <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> with the fire of his furnaces, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> filled with magical reveries, he believed himself capable of constructing a new system of philosophy, from examining the course of the stars, and the products of his alembics. With the daring assurance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, he declared man to be composed of sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; and, having traced the origin of all diseases to certain chemical operations, he flattered himself, that by means of his arcanum he could preserve health, and prolong, to an indefinite extent, the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of human existence.\n\nVan Helmont, the disciple of Paracelsus, not less fanciful, but more scientific than his master, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of something more than chemical principles to explain the functions of the animal machine. He therefore introduced his arch\u00e6us, an intelligent being, who established his throne in the epigastric region, having several subaltern ministers under him, who presided over the several functions of the body, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> seats were, the head, the chest, and the belly.\n\nDes Cartes. In the philosophy of Des Cartes, the separate existence of the vital principle is entirely rejected. He availed himself of the progress that had been made by Willis, and some other anatomists, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the nervous system, to form an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of the vital functions, founded on the supposition of the nervous fluid, or what was then called the animal spirits; and this nervous fluid was assumed independently of the sensitive soul, to explain the appearances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> motion.\n\nThe discovery of the valves in the veins by Fabricius; of the lymphatics by Rudbeck and Bartholin; of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a> by Aellius, and of the circulation of the blood by Harvey, all of which took place during the 17th century, gave to physiology an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and a clearness which it never possessed before that period. Some account of the discoveries in the circulating and absorbing systems, hath been already given under Anatomy; but as these discoveries have been productive of great advantages, both in general physiology, and in medicine, it will be worth while briefly to trace their origin and progress.\n\nTo begin with the circulation of the blood, Hippocrates speaks of the usual and constant motion of the blood, of the veins and arteries as the fountains of human nature, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> the whole body, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they be dried up, man dies. He says, that the blood-vessels are, for this reason, everywhere dispersed through the whole body; that they give spirits, moisture, and motion; that they all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from one; and that this one has no beginning and no end, for where there is a circle there is no beginning. In such language was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of physicians accustomed to express his vague <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of a circulation; for so far was he from having acquired accurate conceptions on this subject, that when he saw the motions of the heart, he believed that the auricles were two bellows to draw in air, and to ventilate the blood.\n\nWhen after his time anatomy came to be more studied, the notions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> respecting the blood were better defined; and, however chimerical they may seem to us, they were partly derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a> and experiment. On opening dead bodies, they found that the arteries were almost empty, and that very nearly the whole of the blood was collected in the veins, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> auricle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENTRICLE\">ventricle</a> of the heart. They therefore concluded that the right ventricle was a sort of laboratory; that it attracted the blood from the cavities; by some operation rendered it fit for the purpose of nutrition, and then returned it by the way that it came. From the almost empty state of the arteries, they were led to suppose that the right ventricle prepared air, and that this air was conveyed by the arteries to temper the heat of the several parts to which the branches of the veins were distributed.\n\nTo this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, entertained by Eraclitatus, Galen added an important discovery. By certain experiments, he proved, that the arteries contained blood as well as the veins. But this discovery was the occasion of some embarrassment. How was the blood to get from the right to the left ventricle? To solve the difficulty in which his new discovery had involved him, he supposed that the branches of the veins and arteries anastomosed; that when the blood was carried to the lungs by the pulmonary vein, it was partly prevented by the valves from returning; that therefore during the contraction of the thorax it passed through the small connecting branches to the pulmonary vein, and was thence conveyed along with the air to the left ventricle to flow in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AORTA\">aorta</a>. This opinion, so agreeable to fact, unfortunately afterwards gave place to another that was the result of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> speculation. This notion was, that the left ventricle received air by the pulmonary vein; and that all its blood was derived through pores in the septum of the heart.\n\nThe passage through the septum being once suggested, and happening to be more easily conceived than one through the lungs, it was generally supposed the only one for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of centuries; and supported likewise, as it was thought, by Galen's authority, it was deemed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLASPHEMY\">blasphemy</a> in the schools of medicine to talk of another. In 1543, however, Vesalius having published his immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> upon the structure of the human body, and given his reasons in the sixth book why he ventured to dissent from Galen, he particularly shewed how it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> that the blood could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the septum of the heart. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> routed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of anatomists; and every one grew eager to discover the real passage which the blood must take in going from the right to the left ventricle. The discovery of this was first made by Michael Servetus, a Spanish physician, who published his opinion in 1553. He expressly says, that the blood does not pass through the septum of the heart, as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> believed, but is conveyed by an admirable contrivance from the right ventricle of the heart, by a long passage through the lungs. This opinion was deemed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERETIC\">heretic</a>, and Servetus's book was suppressed by public authority. Soon after, however, the same discovery was made by Realdo Columbus, an Italian professor, who published his account in 1559. It farther appears, that Andreas C\u0153lafloinis, who published in 1571, and again in 1593, was acquainted, not only with the lesser circulation, but observed, that the blood sometimes flowed from the branches of the veins towards their trunks; and that when a vein was tied with a ligature, it swelled between the ligature and the distal extremity of the vein, and not between the ligature and the heart. He thence inferred, that the veins and arteries opened into each other, and ventured to af-\nfert that the blood could not return by the arteries to the left ventricle of the heart. He did not, however, discover the true circulation, but most unaccountably maintained with Aristotle, of whom he was a zealous disciple, that the blood flowed like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> of Euripus, backward and forward in the same channel, and supposed that it flowed from the arteries into the veins during sleep, and back again from the veins into the arteries till the waking state.\n\nIn 1574, Hieronymus Fabricius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> Aquapendente, while he was seeking for a cause by which to explain the various swellings of some veins, which had arisen from friction and ligature, he, to his great joy and astonishment, discovered their valves in one of his dissections; and here again the true theory of circulation seemed almost unavoidable. Yet whoever reads the small treatise De Venarum Ostioli, first printed by Fabricius in 1603, will soon perceive that he was as far from entertaining a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> notion of the circulation as his predecessors. Notwithstanding all that he saw, he still was of opinion that the blood flowed from the heart to the extremities even in the veins. He thought that the valves were intended by nature only to check and moderate its force. He calls them an instance of admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and mistakes his own awkward conjecture for one of the designs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> intelligence. In another respect, it must be confessed that he bore no inconsiderable share in promoting the discovery of the circulation. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> on the valves, the formation of the fetus, and chick in ovo, he directed the attention of his pupil Harvey to those subjects where it was likely that the motion of the blood would frequently occur.\n\nHarvey, who was born in 1578, and graduated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a> in 1602, examined the valves with more accuracy than Fabricius, and explained their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in a treatise which he published soon after his graduation. In 1616, he taught the true doctrine of the circulation in his lectures, and published on the subject in 1628. He was the first author who spoke confidently of the motion of the blood, and who, unbiassed by the doctrine of the ancients, drew rational conclusions from his experiments and observations. His books present us with many indications of a great mind, acute discernment, unwearyed application, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> remark, bold inquiry, and a clear, forcible, and manly reasoning; and every one who considers the surmise which his doctrine occasioned among the anatomists of those days, the strong opposition that it met with from some, and the numerous and powerful prejudices which it had to encounter from the sanction of time and of great names, must allow it was new; and that the author has from its importance, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of eminent discoverers, ancient or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>.\n\nWe have been the more particular in tracing the progressive discovery of the circulation, and in attempting to show that the real merit of the discovery is due to Harvey, because both the abilities and the originality of this eminent man have been called in question by his countryman Dr William Hunter; and many hints are given in the writings of some foreign physiologists, that the circulation was at least guessed at by Hippocrates and other ancient writers.\n\nWe shall be less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> in tracing the discovery of the lymphatic system, because this has been related more at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in the article ANATOMY.\n\nWe learn from Galen, that certain vessels had been seen in kids by Eraclitratius, which appear to have been lacteals, though he called them arteries. These lacteals were, however, first accurately distinguished in 1622, of the discovery by Afellius, who printed his account in 1627. In 1651, Pecquet published his account of the thoracic duct, which appears, however, to have been seen before by Eustachius. In 1653, Bartholin published on the lymphatics, which had been some time before discovered by Rudbeck. In 1654, Glisson ascribed to these vessels the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> back the lubricating lymph from the arteries into the blood, or considered them as absorbents. In 1664, the valves of these vessels were discovered by Swammerdam, and a year after, an account of them was given by Kuylich. The farther discoveries of Nuck, Nouges, Warton, Steno, Hunter, Monro, Hewson, Cruikshank, Sheldon, Macagni, &c., have nearly completed our knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> system, and its uses.\n\nIn the latter end of the 17th century, some important discoveries were made on the subject of respiration, by our countryman Mayow; and these were supported by the observations of Lower, Verheyen, and Borelli. These discoveries, however, lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DORMANT\">dormant</a> till they were brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> a hundred years after in consequence of the experiments of Priestley and Lavoisier.\n\nDuring the 17th century, considerable progress was made in completing the knowledge of the internal organs of generation. Much was done in this way by De Graaff and Malpighi, and Leuvenhoek, the two latter of whom made several discoveries with the assistance of their microscopes, though Leuvenhoek founded on his observations a theory of generation which at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> appears not a little ridiculous.\n\nThe beginning of the 18th century is remarkable for the promulgation of a new physiological doctrine, founded on a mistaken application of the circulation of the blood. We allude to the system of Boerhaave. This great physician supposed that all the functions of the living body, excepting the will, are carried on by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> movements, susceptible of rigid calculation, which necessarily succeed each other in the organs, from the time that life commences. These movements are brought into action as soon as the animal begins to respire, and are the consequence of an impulsive power in the heart, renewed by means of the influence of the nervous fluid brought from the brain. He conceived the living body to be merely a hydraulic machine, in which the heart performs the office of a piston, and that the alternate contractions and dilatations that take place without intermission in that organ, are owing to the alternately increased and diminished compression of the nerves that are distributed to the heart. When a contraction takes place, the blood fills the large arteries, and thus distends and compresses them; when the principal nerves of the heart, which pass between these arteries, must of course become compressed, and thus their influence being diminished, a relaxation takes place. But in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as the heart is relaxed, the large arteries become empty, and consequently cease to compress the nerves, which thus recovering their influence, reanimate the heart to a new contraction. Thus succeed each other without interruption the movements which form the mechanical principle of all the sensible motions that we observe in the animal machine.\nProceeding on these principles, Boerhaave conceived some very strange notions reflecting the constituent properties of the living <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, in which he saw no other mark of vitality than the globular form of their particles. He confined all the functions of the several organs to the operations of rounding into spheres the particles of the fluids which were presented to them, or of preserving that form in those which they already contained. He thought that the lungs were chiefly of advantage, because they contained within them a complete series of vessels, in which the particles of the blood can receive all those dimensions which may fit them to circulate through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the body. The greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> with which the fluids circulate through the secretory organs, constitutes the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the nature of the secretions. Various orders of vessels receive the blood and other fluids which pass through these divisions, subject to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRAULICS\">hydraulics</a>; and when a fluid got by chance into an order of vessels that was not fitted to receive it, some disease was the consequence. Everything in the animal machine was reduced to an arrangement of conduits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, cords, levers, pulleys, and other mechanical contrivances, put into action by mechanical means.\n\nThus was completed the system of mechanical physiology, which was begun some time before by Bellini and Borelli; and this system maintained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> in defiance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sense, till about the middle of the 18th century. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, however, there arose two men, whose enlarged ideas and acute genius induced them to differ from the received opinions of the day, and to think for themselves. These were Hoffman and Stahl, who, though they did not, any more than Boerhaave, form complete or unobjectionable theories, contributed much to improve our ideas of the animal economy.\n\nHoffman saw, that in the living body we ought not to separate the principle of vitality from the general properties of matter. He believed that that principle, susceptible in itself of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and motion, was sufficient for all the occasions and all the functions of the body which it animated. The animal body was not, in his eyes, an hydraulic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> machine, formed of solids and canals, differing only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, form, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> and force. He saw, that if the solids <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon the fluids, they must, in their turn, react upon the solids; and that life could subsist only by these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> actions and reactions. The essential cause of life, according to Hoffman, is the progressive motion of the blood, occasioned by the impulse of the heart, and kept up by the alternate contractions and dilatations of the vessels. These contractions and dilatations are the consequence of the force of an elasticity inherent in the vascular fibres, and this force is still farther promoted by the different structure of these elastic fibres, which is such that they can be penetrated by the blood and the nervous fluid. This last fluid he imagined to be composed of aerial and ethereal particles enveloped in a certain portion of a very pure subtile lymph, that served them as a vehicle. By this fluid the cavities of the nerves are filled, and it constitutes the sentient soul, in which resides the seat of the passions. Now, all the functions, even those which we attribute to a sentient principle, are the effect of physical powers, whose mechanism has, however, something more sublime and more exalted with respect to the animal operations than to others.\n\nIf all the nervous, vascular, and membranous parts, preserve a moderate degree of action, and a moderate state of tension and relaxation, the solids are subjected to oscillatory motions which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other, and produce a proper equilibrium in the system. In this state, all the operations of the body and the mind take place with proper regularity; and this happy harmony, by afflicting to the animal the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENITUDE\">plenitude</a> of its existence, becomes the foundation of health. This degree of moderate tension is always more or less altered in a state of disease.\n\nLittle satisfied with all the theories founded on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> of Stahl's mechanism, and convinced of their insufficiency to explain the phenomena of vitality, Stahl admitted forces that were something more than mechanical, and that were directed by an intelligent principle which applies them to their destined uses, and which, by distributing them with a wise economy, proportions or accommodates them to the different occasions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>. His disciples consider Stahl as the first modern writer who has treated the science of man on a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and according to a philosophical arrangement; and as his doctrine has still numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> in the medical schools of France, we shall be somewhat more particular on it than on that of Hoffman.\n\nIn determining the limits between medicine and the other physical sciences, Stahl commences with separating from the former all those principles which, though true in themselves, have no relation to the nature of that science, which he considers as originating in observation alone. The knowledge of the physical state of the animal body cannot, he thinks, throw any light, either on the injuries to which it is exposed, or on the means of preventing or removing them. Consequently it is of little use in medicine, and has no right to govern an art, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of which is, to remedy those injuries that threaten the human body. He proves that living bodies are freed from the necessary laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, because all their actions tend to one common end\u2014an end which embraces the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of the movements essential to life, and the means established for its preservation. The human body, by means of this mixture of mechanical and vital powers, tends naturally to self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>; but, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the organic structure to which is attached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the actions peculiar to the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, is founded on this mixture. It is therefore necessary that the body should be in a state of resisting this tendency, in order that it may be sustained; and as the corruptibility inherent in its nature, purifies it through every period of its existence, the opposing action necessary to prevent the corruption from taking place, must also be exercised without intermission. It is this preserving action that constitutes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of life.\n\nThe preservation of the body is indeed effected by a sort of mechanical action; it requires the corporeal organs as its instruments, and it depends on different coexistent and successive actions. Health is the result of that just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a> of the organs which enables them to perform their functions with ease.\n\nThe exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> which subsists between the structure of each organ, and the functions it is destined to perform, demonstrates to the philosophical eye an intelligent and wise principle, that in the formation of organized bodies directs and prescribes every thing in","sp":58,"ep":63},{"h":"HORACE","t":"M.

Those animals which live chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> animal food, have most of their teeth sharp and pointed, for the purpose of seizing and tearing their prey, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANIVOROUS\">granivorous</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> animals have very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and strong grinders, in which the hard substance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called enamel (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> what Blake calls corpus stratum,) forms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>. Such are also found in most reptiles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, and in many fishes; but in some of these the teeth seem less to serve the purpose of dividing the food, than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> and retain it till swallowed. Birds of the Teeth have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> teeth, though some of them have the mandibles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> so formed as to divide and cut in pieces their food.\n\nDuring mastication the food is mixed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALIVA\">saliva</a>, and is thus better fitted for easy solution in the stomach. This infalivation of the food may, however, take place, without previous mastication. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> for serpents to swallow their food whole; but in order to facilitate its passage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the throat, they first besmear it all over with their mucous saliva. In many animals, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> similar to infalivation takes place, while the food remains in the mouth. In several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the ape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> there is a pouch situated on each side of the jaw, and in these pouches the greater part of the food is retained, not merely as some supposito, to serve as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, but to undergo a dilution by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> that are there secreted. In granivorous birds, the food is first received into a membranous bag, formed by a dilation of the gullet, and commonly called the crop, where it is macerated by the fluids that are there separated by means of glands or exhaling velluses, and passes down, as the animal requires, to be further prepared by the stomach. The buffard, indeed, though a granivorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, has no proper crop, but the gullet is furnished with numerous and large glands.\n\nFor an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and properties of saliva, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, No. 2723.\n\nThe operation of deglutition depends chiefly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the tongue, and on that of the muscles which surround the pharynx and gullet. It is more or less speedy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as these are more or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and vigorous. Most animals, after having once swallowed their food, do not receive it again into the mouth; but this takes place in several tribes, and is called rumination, or chewing the cud.\n\nRumination takes place chiefly in those animals that feed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a>, and have not a muscular stomach; such as all the tribes that Linnaeus has ranked under the order pecora. In these the food, after being slightly chewed, is received into the first stomach, and after remaining there for a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it is gradually brought by a retrograde action of the gullet into the mouth, where it undergoes a complete tituration and infalivation.\ntion, and is then conveyed into the 2d, 3d, and 4th stomachs, to be mixed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GASTRIC_JUICE\">gastric juice</a>.\n\nSome of those birds which have a diluting sac or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGLUVIES\">ingluvies</a>, seem likewise to ruminate. This in the parrot was observed by the gentlemen of the French academy. It has since been observed in rooks, macaws, cockatoos, and others; and Mr Hunter, to whom physiology is so much indebted, discovered that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> pigeon secrete in their ingluvies a certain liquor for feeding their young; and that most kinds of what have been thought ruminating birds do very often in expressing their fondness regurgitate their food. Yet both this and another species of regurgitation which is very common with those animals that swallow indigestible substances with their food, should be carefully distinguished from rumination. For a farther account of rumination, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs of ruminating animals, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARATIVE_ANATOMY\">Comparative Anatomy</a>, No. 228\u2014234, and Phil. Trans. 1807, Part ii.\n\nThe food having entered the stomach, undergoes at that organ processes that are partly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>, or rather organic, and partly chemical, depending on the structure of the stomach, and the nature of the juices secreted into its cavity. By these actions it is reduced into a pulpy substance commonly called chyme.\n\nThe organic action of the stomach is greater or less, according as this organ is more or less muscular. There are many animals, chiefly birds of the granivorous tribes, that have a very muscular stomach, commonly called gizzard, capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a>, not only the grains received into it, but even of reducing to powder small pieces of glass, and of blunting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a> and lancets. These facts were first proved by Borelli, who introduced into the gizzards of fowls, nuts, filberts, hollow spheres of glass, hollow cubes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, small pyramids of wood, and several other substances, which he found were either crushed together, or broken to pieces. He computes the power exerted by the stomach of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> cock as equal to the pressure of 1350 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. These experiments were repeated and verified by Spallanzani.\n\nSome animals that are not possessed of a muscular stomach have, within that organ, teeth, or other hard bodies, for the purpose of breaking or grinding their food. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSTACEA\">crustacea</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a> and lobsters.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many animals have what Spallanzani calls intermediate stomachs, i.e., not so muscular as the gizzard of fowls, nor so membranous as the stomachs of ruminating animals; this is the case with many birds, as ravens, crows, herons, &c. The stomachs of these animals are possessed of considerable force, though this is not nearly equal to that exerted by the gizzard. These animals possess the power of rejecting by the mouth the substances that are incapable of digestion in the stomach, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, or sometimes every three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>.\n\nThe animals with membranous stomachs are very numerous, comprehending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, most beasts and birds of prey; many reptiles, snakes, fish, &c. The stomachs of these animals are susceptible of but little muscular action, though in many species they both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> upon the food, and reject it through the gullet, on various occasions. Birds of prey, like the ravens, crows, &c., possess the power of rejecting, in the form of pellets, the indigestible parts of their food, which usually takes place every 24 hours.\n\nA most interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> by Mr Everard Home is published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1807, Discoveries part ii. on the structure and functions of the stomachs of various animals. We regret that we can here give Home little more than the results of his inquiries.\n\nFrom previous investigations respecting the stomachs of ruminating animals, Mr Home was led to believe that the fourth stomach in these tribes was either always, or during digestion, divided into two portions, each performing a different office in the digestive process; and he even conjectured, that a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> might take place in other animals.\n\nMr Home has examined the stomachs of a great variety of animals, and investigated the progress of digestion in ruminants, the hare tribe, which occasionally ruminate, the beaver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DORMOUSE\">dormouse</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAT\">rat</a>, common rat, mouse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and ass, kangaroo, peccary, hippopotamus, elephant, the cetacea, fowls, and lastly in man.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> stomach appears to be the uniting link between those that are fitted only to digest vegetable substances, and those of animals that are entirely carnivorous; and yet we find, that in its internal structure it is in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> respect similar both to those of the plantigrade monkey and squirrel, which usually digest only vegetable food, and to those of carnivorous animals.\n\nThe human stomach is occasionally divided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDIAC\">cardiac</a> and a pyloric portion, by a muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> similar to that of other animals; and as this circum-pyloric formation has not before been noticed, it is proper to be more particular in describing it.\n\nThe first instance in which Mr Home observed this muscular contraction in the human stomach, was in a woman who died in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of being burnt, and who had been unable to take much nourishment for several days before her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. The stomach was found empty, and was taken out of the body at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> after death. It was carefully <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> to expose its internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, and gently distended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The contraction was so permanent, that after the stomach had been kept in water, in an inverted state, for several days, and at different times distended with air, the appearance was not altogether destroyed.\n\nSince that time, Mr Home has taken every opportunity of examining the human stomach shortly after death; and he finds that this contraction, in a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, is very generally met with. He is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that this effect is not produced by a peculiar band of muscular fibres, but that it arises from the muscular coat, in the middle part of the stomach, being thrown into action to a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> according to circumstances. When this part of the stomach is examined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a>, its muscular fibres are not to be distinguished from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the body be examined so late as 24 hours after death, this appearance is rarely met with, a circumstance which accounts for its not having before been particularly noticed.\n\nThat the food is dissolved in the cardiac portion of food first the human stomach, is proved by this part only being dissolved in found digested after death; the instances of which are diac sufficiently numerous to require no addition being made to them. This could not take place unless the solvent liquor was deposited there. Mr Hunter goes so far as to\nto say in his paper on this subject, \"there are few dead bodies in which the stomach at its great end is not in some degree digested.\"\n\nThat the chyle is not formed there, and that it is commonly formed before the food passes through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYLORUS\">pylorus</a>, is proved by the result of some experiments made by Mr Hunter upon dogs, in the year 1765. The dogs were killed while digestion was going on; and in all, the food was least dissolved, or even mixed, towards the great end of the stomach, but became more and more towards the pylorus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> within which it was mixed with a whitish fluid like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREAM\">cream</a>.\n\nFrom the result of these experiments, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of other animals, it is reasonable to believe, that the glands situated at the termination of the cuticular lining of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>, which are described by Mr Home, secrete the solvent liquor, which is occasionally poured on the food, so as to be intimately mixed with it before it is removed from the cardiac portion; and the muscular contraction retains it there, till this takes place.\n\nSuch contraction being occasionally required in the stomach, accounts for its being more or less bent upon itself, as by this structure it is more readily divided into two portions, by the action of the muscular fibres at that part where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> is formed.\n\nThis contraction also explains why the contents of the stomach are not completely discharged from the first effect of an emetic; and by it Mr Home thinks we may explain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a> of the stomach, and some kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>.\n\nAfter comparing the stomachs of several carnivorous animals with that of man; in tracing the gradation from carnivorous beasts through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAT\">bat</a> tribe to birds of prey, Mr Home remarks that \"the only real link between the stomachs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> and birds is that of the ornithorhynchus (or platypus), which, however, is more an approach to the gizzard, being lined with a cuticle containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and having the same relative situation to the oesophagus and duodenum. The food of this animal is not known; it is probably of both kinds; the papillae at the pylorus, which appear to be the secreting ducts of glands, are peculiar to it.\n\nFrom the facts and observations brought forward in this valuable paper, Mr Home deduces the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> conclusions. \"That the solvent liquor is secreted from glands of a somewhat similar structure in all animals, but much larger and more conspicuous in some than in others.\n\n\"That these glands are always situated near the orifice of the cavity, the contents of which are exposed to their secretion.\n\n\"That the viscid substance found on the internal membrane of all the stomachs that were examined recently after death, is reduced to this state by a secretion from the whole surface of the stomach, which coagulates albumen. This appears to be proved, by every part of the fourth cavity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>'s stomach having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of coagulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>.\n\n\"This property in the general secretion of the stomach leads to an opinion, that the conglutination of fluid substances is necessary for their being acted on by the solvent liquor; and a practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the late Mr Hunter, that weak stomachs can digest only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> food, is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of it.\n\n\"That in converting animal and vegetable substances into chyle, the food is first intimately mixed with the general secretions of the stomach, and after it has been acted on by them, the solvent liquor is poured upon it, by which the nutritious part is dissolved. This solution is afterwards conveyed into the pyloric portion, where it is mixed with the secretions peculiar to that cavity, and converted into chyle.\n\n\"The great strength of the muscles of the pyloric portion of some stomachs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, by their action, compress the contents, and separate the chyle from the indigestible part of the food.\n\n\"In animals whose food is easy of digestion, the stomach consists of a cardiac and pyloric portion only; but in those whose food is difficult of digestion, other parts are superadded, in which it undergoes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> before it is submitted to that process.\"\n\nThe action of the juices of the stomach, or of what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the gastric juice, appears to have much more effect in the process of chymification, than the muscular juice. Action of the stomach, though the dissolving power of this fluid seems to be proportionally less in those animals that have the most muscular stomachs. The gastric juice of granivorous birds is capable of dissolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>; but when this is entire, it requires four or five days for solution; whereas when bruised, half that time is sufficient. Even grain is not dissolved in it except when bruised. The gastric juice of animals with intermediate stomachs dissolves flesh and cartilage, but not bone. It is incapable of dissolving entire seeds. In animals with membranous stomachs, the gastic juice is extremely active, and seems to be almost the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in the digestive process. In some of these animals, however, as the ruminating tribes, this fluid has no effect on the food, unless it be bruised, or thoroughly masticated. Spallanzani found, that owls digest flesh and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, but not grain\u2014that the gastic juice of the eagle dissolves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and bone, and even animal and vegetable matters, when it is taken out of the body\u2014that a wood pigeon may be gradually brought to live on flesh\u2014that the owl and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALCON\">falcon</a> do not digest bread\u2014that the gastic juice of the dog dissolves even the enamel of the teeth.\n\nHence, in every order of animals, the gastic juice is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cause of digestion, and it agrees in all in many properties, and differs in others. In the frog, the newt, fleshy fishes, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>-blooded animals, it produces digestion in a temperature nearly equal to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. In warm blooded animals it is capable of dissolving the aliment in a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> lower than that of these animals. In them too the food is digested in a few hours, whereas in the opposite kind it requires several days, and even weeks, particularly in serpents; likewise, the gastic juice of the gallinaceous clafs can dissolve only bodies of a soft and yielding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, and previously triturated; whilst in others, as serpents, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERON\">heron</a>, birds of prey, and the dog, it decomposes substances of great tenacity, as ligaments and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENDONS\">tendons</a>; and even of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, as the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> bone. Man belongs to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, but his gastic juice seems to have no action on the hardest kinds of bones. Some species, likewise, are incapable of digesting vegetables, as birds of prey; but man, the dog, cat, crows, &c., dissolve the individuals of both kingdoms alike, and are omnivorous, and in general their gastic juices produce these effects out of the body.\nFor an account of the chemical nature and properties of the gastric juice, see Chemistry, No. 2551.\n\nThe process of chymification depends also, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, on the nature of the substances employed as food, as some of these are much more soluble than others. On this subject much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> may be derived by consulting the experiments of Dr Stark*, and those of M. Goffe of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of which is given in Johnson's Animal Chemistry, vol. i. p. 207. From the latter experiments it appears, 1/3, That the following substances are either insoluble, or are not digested in the usual time in the stomach.\n\n**Animal substances.**\n1. Tendinous parts.\n2. Bones.\n3. Oily or fatty parts.\n4. Indurated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>.\n\n**Vegetable substances.**\n1. Oily or emulsive seeds.\n2. Expelled oils of different nuts and kernels.\n3. Dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>.\n4. Kind of farinaceous substances.\n5. Pods of beans and peas.\n6. Skins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>.\n7. Hulks of fruits, with grains or seeds.\n8. Capsules of fruit, with grains.\n9. Ligneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of fruits.\n10. The gastric juice does not destroy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of some seeds; hence bitter-root, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, miltetoe, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> which sometimes grow upon trees, are produced by the means of the excrements of birds, the kernels of seeds being defended from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MENSTRUM\">menstrum</a> by their exterior covering.\n\n2d, That the following are partly soluble, viz:\n1. Pork dressed various ways.\n2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> puddings.\n3. Fritters of eggs, fried eggs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">bacon</a>.\n\n**Vegetable Substances.**\n1. Salads of different kinds, rendered more so when dressed.\n2. White of cabbage less soluble than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>.\n3. Beet, cardoons, onions, and leeks.\n4. Root of curvy-grafts, red and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARROTS\">carrots</a>, fiscory, are more insoluble in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALAD\">salad</a> than any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>.\n5. Pulp of fruit with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, when not fluid.\n6. Warm bread and sweet pastry, from their producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDITY\">acidity</a>.\n7. Fresh and dry figs. By frying all these substances in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> they become still less soluble. If they are not dissolved in the stomach, they are, however, in the course of their passage through the intestines.\n\n3d, That the following are soluble, or easy of digestion, being generally reduced to chyme in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, or an hour and a half.\n\n**Animal Substances.**\n1. Veal, lamb, and in general the flesh of young animals, are sooner dissolved than that of old.\n2. Fresh eggs.\n3. Cows milk.\n4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERCH\">Perch</a> boiled with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and parsley. When fried or seasoned with oil, wine, and white sauce, it is not so soluble.\n\n**Vegetable Substances.**\n1. Herbs, as spinach, mixed with horseradish, are less soluble.\n2. Celery. Tops of alfalfa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>, and the ornithogalum of the Pyrenees.\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">Bottom</a> of artichokes.\n4. Boiled pulp of fruits, seasoned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>.\n5. Pulp or meal of farinaceous seeds.\n6. Different sorts of wheaten bread, without butter, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKING\">baking</a>; the crust more so than the crumb.\n7. Salted bread of Geneva more so than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> without salt; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> bread in proportion as it contains more bran is less soluble.\n8. Rapes, turnips, potatoes, parsnips, not too old.\n9. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> arabic, but its acid is soon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>. The Arabians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> it as food.\n\nThe solvent power of the gastric juice is increased by various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIMULANTS\">stimulants</a>, especially by those called condiments, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> salt, spices, mustard, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, as well as by various and spirituous liquors and old cheese in small quantities, and by various bitters. It is retarded by large quantities of diluting liquors, especially when taken hot; by acids and astringents taken a short time after eating; by unctuous substances; by mental employment, or severe bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, too soon after a meal; and by leaning with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\n\nIt may be proper here to notice the various opinions that have been entertained respecting the immediate theories of cause of digestion. The principal of these opinions are, digestion, that it is produced by coction or heat; by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRITURATION\">trituration</a> in the stomach; by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>.\n\nThat it is not brought about by heat alone, will appear from the circumstance, that many cold-blooded animals digest their food as completely, though not so expeditiously, as warm-blooded animals.\n\nThat it is not effected by trituration in the stomach alone, is evident from the experiments that have been made by Spallanzani, Stevens, and others, of giving to animals food enclosed in hollow perforated balls, sufficiently strong to resist the muscular power of the stomach; as the balls have been found empty, and not compressed.\n\nThat it is not owing to fermentation is proved by the circumstance, that the more perfectly digestion proceeds, the less is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> of gases in the stomach; the contrary of which would be the case, if digestion consisted in a fermentation of the aliment.\n\nThat it does not depend on putridity, is evidenced by the observations that have been made on putrid food given to dogs, and examined some time after, when it was found perfectly sweet.\n\nOn the whole it appears, that in most animals the digestion of food in the stomach depends partly on a due degree of heat, partly on the vital action of the stomach, but chiefly on the action of the gastric juice.\n\nWhen the aliment has been converted into the stomach, the crude pulp called chyme, they are gradually propelled through the pylorus into the duodenum, where they are mixed with the bile, the pancreatic juice, and the fluids that are separated by the mucous coat of that intestine, and are thus reduced to a still finer pulp, containing, as one of its principal ingredients, the nutritious fluid called chyle, the nature and properties of which, as they have been but slightly mentioned in the former parts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be noticed here.\n\nThe properties of chyle have not been minutely investigated; but according to Fordyce, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has been carried, the chyle of quadrupeds is so similar to that of man, and of each other, as hardly to be distinguished, even in tribes the most opposite to each other in their structure, food, and habits of life. As far as we can perceive, the chyle of a dog or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a> differs in nothing from that of a sheep or an ox.\n\nThe chyle consists of three parts; one part which is fluid, and contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>, but coagulates on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAVASATION\">extravasation</a>.\n\nThe second part consists of a fluid, which is coagulable by heat, and in all its properties hitherto observed, it is similar to the serum of the blood.\n\nThe third part consists of globules, which render the whole white and opake. These globules have been supposed by many to be an expressed oil; but this has not been proved. Neither has it been perfectly demonstrated that sugar is contained in the chyle, although it has\nbeen made very probable. The difficulty of determining these points arises from the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> that can be collected, the largest animals not supplying more than one ounce or two, at the most. However, the part coagulating on extravasation; the part agreeing with serum in its qualities; the globular part, which in some animals, but not in quadrupeds, exits without giving whiteness to the chyle\u2014alone, or along with sugar, form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> parts of the chyle.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> pulpy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> containing the chyle is carried forward from the duodenum through the whole course of the intestines, where it is subjected to the continual action of the internal wrinkled membrane of the bowels, and its nutritious particles, or chyle, selected and absorbed by the lacteals that are abundantly distributed there, and open their mouths directly within the cavity.\n\nAs to the movements of the alimentary canal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of hairs found in the stomach, and the balls through the intestines, where they are thrown up, would appear to indicate a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. The intestinal part has a motion similar to that of a worm, and is called the vermicular or peristaltic. Here every portion retains its own motion, although it be separated from the rest by ligatures. The stomach of the polype, the gullets of the ruminating kinds, and the ceca, have the motion in different directions at different times; and that observed in the alimentary canal of a loupe is, when viewed through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> in the time of action, amazingly rapid; the stimulating causes employed are the food, the different liquids with which it is mixed, the air, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> where they exist, and a portion of heat. Some degree of heat is necessary to every process of digestion, both in the animal and vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; what that degree is depends on the nature of the living body; and is various according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, its employments, and habits.\n\nWith respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of digestion in the lower classes of animals, we can say but little. We know that their food is dissolved in the stomachs of the crustacea, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">mollusca</a>, and of polypes; but whether this process in most insects and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> is anything more than imbibition, or taking in aliment, which is to undergo little change, we are uncertain. We know, indeed, that many insects live on substances which must be dissolved before they enter into the pores of their bodies, and that many of them abound in acid juices, which are well fitted for this solution. It does not appear that plants possess what may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of digestion.\n\nThe relations between digestion and the functions we have already considered, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, are various and important. The sympathies that exist between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and the stomach, have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> acknowledged. Several affections of the brain are accompanied with sickness at the stomach, loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a>, and indigestion; while, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the deranged state of the digestive organs seldom fails to produce giddiness, headache, ringing in the ears, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRIVATION\">deprivation</a> of sight, &c.; and if the former symptoms arise to a great height, as in the case of overloaded stomach or surfeit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMA\">coma</a>, or even apoplexy, is frequently produced. In many nervous affections, particularly hysteria and hypochondriasis, in which there frequently takes place alternating accumulations of air in the stomach and bowels, the affections of the head, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUPOR\">stupor</a>, confusion of thought, partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, &c., sometimes proceed to such a height, as to threaten, or even sometimes to produce, an apoplectic paroxysm. In many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> these affections are referred immediately to the head; but are proved, in most instances, to depend on the disordered state of the alimentary canal, from the immediate relief procured by those remedies which promote the discharge of air, or produce copious evacuation from the bowels.\n\nOn the other hand, in some diseases, where the head is primarily affected, as in phrenitis hydrocephalica (water in the head), the complaint is referred to the bowels, from the colic pains or other disordered state of these. The daily experience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> men shows how much intense thought diminishes the digestive powers, and how imperfectly studious occupations can be carried on after a full meal. The action of the digestive organs is also considerably influenced by the mind, or the passions. We know how readily the appetite may be diminished or destroyed by sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> or affliction.\n\nThe action of the stomach may even be influenced by the will. We have known a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who could vomit whenever he pleased; and Dr Darwin speaks of another who had acquired this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> command over the inverted motions of the stomach and throat, to such a degree, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a subsistence by exhibiting these unnatural powers to the public. At these exhibitions he was accustomed to swallow a pint of red rough gooseberries, and a pint of white smooth ones; to bring them up in small parcels into his mouth, and restore them separately to the spectators, who called for red or white, as they pleased, till the whole were redelivered.\n\nThe sympathies that take place between the brain and the digestive organs, are easily explained, from considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the great sympathetic nerve, to illustrate which we have given a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> (fig. 1) showing its course and distribution from the head through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, as far as the stomach.\n\nThe relations between the digestive and the locomotive functions, are not less obvious. Experience shows between how much digestion depends on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> exercise, and how imperfectly it is carried on in the stomach of the indolent and sedentary; while, on the other hand, when the stomach is overloaded, voluntary motion becomes difficult and fatiguing. Spasmodic contractions of the muscles, twitchings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and similar affections, are the common attendants of indigestion, though these may perhaps be referred equally to the nervous as to the muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>.\n\nThe principal morbid affections of digestion are, nausea, flatulence, eructation, rumination (G), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOMITING\">vomiting</a>, heartburn, digestion.\n\n(c) That ruminating power which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to the quadrupeds of the order Pecora, is sometimes met with in man. We have heard of persons who regularly brought up their food into the mouth soon after eating, chewed it over again, swallowed the juices with the saliva, and spat out the more solid parts. In these cases, the rumination is\nChap. VI. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">Absorption</a>.\n\nWe have said that the chyle is taken up from the compound pulpy matter composed of the food and the animal juices, as it passes through the intestines, by the lacteals. This, however, is not the only absorption that takes place in the animal body. The fluids poured out into cavities by the exhalant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>, as well as all the secreted or exuding fluids, and even the solid materials of the system, are taken up by the lymphatics, and carried into the circulation; the blood poured out into cells in some parts, is evidently absorbed by veins; and, as we shall endeavour to prove, an absorption takes place over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface of the body.\n\nWhat is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> system, is composed, in the superior animals, of the lacteals, the mesenteric glands, the thoracic duct, the lymphatics, and the lymphatic glands. For an account of these in man, see Anatomy, Part I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. i. This system, in a greater or less degree, is found in all animals, except some mollusca, insects, worms, and zoophytes. See Cuvier's Legons, tom. iv. lec. xxviii. and Blumenbach's Comparative Anatomy, chap. xiii.\n\nThe action of the lacteals and lymphatics is probably much the same, and is exerted in a similar manner. That of the lacteals is to convey the nourishing parts of the food into the circulating system; that of the lymphatics to carry to the same system watery fluids, for the purpose of diluting the blood, and such fluid or solid materials as are useless, or may prove noxious to the system. The action of the lacteals may be readily seen on opening an animal killed two or three hours after eating; and in this way they were first seen by Afellius. They are then found filled with a milky fluid, while, at other times, they are invisible. That the lymphatics are the principal organs of absorption, is now the general opinion of all physiologists, though their action in this way can seldom be demonstrated. As, however, it has been satisfactorily proved, that the veins do not in general absorb, and as the lymphatics that proceed from parts that contain irritating matters, are often seen inflamed, proving that they have imbibed a part of the irritating matter, there is little doubt that the office of absorption belongs almost exclusively to the action of the lymphatics.\n\nMr John Hunter made several experiments to show that the veins do not absorb. He conveyed milk, coloured with various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> substances, or perfumed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, into the small intestine of an ass, which was soon after killed. On opening the veins of the intestine, and veins allowing the blood to separate into serum and coagulum, the serum was found neither to be tinged with the colouring matters, nor scented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFUME\">perfume</a>, while the coloured milk was evident in the lacteals. That the veins, however, do in some cases perform the office of absorbents, is evident from the speedy depletion of the corpora cavernosa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a>, after having been distended with arterious blood; and from a similar depletion that takes place in the nipple of the female breast.\n\nThe principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in dispute respecting the function of absorption in man and the higher classes of animals, is whether the skin possesses the power of absorption. This question, as it is both curious and important, we shall examine pretty much at large; and for this purpose we shall avail ourselves of an able paper on the subject, by Dr George Kellic.\n\nIt had long been received as an established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that the skin was an inhaling or an absorbing organ, and that sometimes the inhalation balanced, or even surpassed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a> of the cutaneous surface; but of late this doctrine of inhalation has been called in question, and, in the opinion of many, entirely overthrown. It has been said, that this absorption neither does nor can take place on the outside of the cuticle; that in every case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> absorption, the epidermis had been injured, or that the matter absorbed had been mechanically forced through it, and brought into immediate contact with the skin.\n\nHaller had asserted *, on the authority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFAULT\">Default</a>, * Elementa that the body acquired an increase of weight in the Physio-warm bath; and this augmentation of weight was *gise*, tom. v. esteemed an experimentum crucis in favour of cutaneous absorption.\n\nExperiments, however, have since been made with every necessary care, which seem to contradict the position, and to prove, that the body acquires no additional weight in the warm bath.\n\nSeguin, from a great many experiments of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, concludes, that there is no inhalation, because the body, so far from gaining, always loses some part of its weight during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a>, although much less than in the air in equal times +.\n\nIn other experiments again, as in those of Gerard and Currie, there was no increase of weight; but the body was\n\nis to be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, depending on the inability of the stomach to propel the solid food into the duodenum.\n\nMr Home, in the paper we have already quoted, (N\u00b0 161\u2014169), relates a curious instance of habitual rumination in a man 19 years of age, who is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>, and has been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOT\">idiot</a> from his birth. He has a very ravenous appetite, and it is necessary to restrict him in the quantity of his food, since, if he eats too much, it disorders his bowels. Fluid food does not remain on his stomach, but comes up again. He swallows his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, which consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> and a half of meat and vegetables in two minutes, and in about 15 minutes he begins to chew the cud. Mr Home was once present on this occasion. The moriel is brought up from the stomach with apparently a very slight effort, and the muscles of the throat are seen in action when it comes into the mouth; he chews it three or four times, and swallows it; there is then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>, and another moriel is brought up. This process is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for about half an hour, and he appears to be more quiet at that time than at any other. Whether the regurgitation of the food is voluntary or involuntary, cannot be ascertained, the man being too deficient in understanding, to give any information on the subject.\nwas not observed to have lost anything during immersion in the warm bath.\n\nNow, during these experiments, the body was doubtless wasting by the pulmonary and cutaneous discharges, and yet the weight of the body either continued unchanged; or where a loss of weight was observed, this was constantly less, greatly less, than is experienced during the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> in air. And we might be inclined to infer, from a truth so general, and so well ascertained, an argument in favour of absorption.\n\nIt might be argued, that the loss of weight amounts to little or nothing, because, during immersion, the body acquires more by inhalation than it does or can do in the air; that the loss by the pulmonary and cutaneous discharges is counterbalanced, or nearly counterbalanced, by the increased absorption.\n\nThose, however, who deny absorption, will not allow us the advantage of this argument. They tell us, that the exhalation by the skin and lungs is diminished, which sufficiently explains why the body loses less in the warm bath than in air. But that the accustomed discharges are suppressed or diminished in the warm or tepid bath, is, we apprehend, far from being proved; and, till this proposition is made good, the argument against cutaneous inhalation cannot be securely maintained.\n\nOne of Dr Currie's cases deserves farther consideration. We allude to the case of dysphagia, published by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, in which Mr M., the subject of the case, was several times immersed in a warm bath of milk and water, and was weighed when taken out. Mr M. it is true, gained no weight while in the warm bath; but the loss continually going on in the air was, as in other trials, suspended during the immersions. Besides, he always expressed great comfort from the bath, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABATEMENT\">abatement</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>; and, subsequent to the daily use of it, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> flowed more plentifully, and became less pungent. An observation, precisely similar, is made by Mr Cruickshank. \"A patient of mine (says Mr Cruickshank), with a stricture of the oesophagus, received nothing, either solid or liquid, into the stomach for two months; he was exceedingly thirsty, and complained of making no water. I ordered him the warm bath for an hour, evening and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; his thirst vanished, and he made water in the same manner as when he used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> by the mouth (ii) *.\n\nBut to return to the case of Mr M. \u2014 Dr Currie himself remarks, that the discharge by urine alone exceeded much in weight the waste of his whole body; and it cannot be doubted that the discharge by stool and perspiration exceeded the weight of the clysters.\u2014Thus it appears, that the egesta exceeded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGESTA\">ingesta</a> in a proportion much greater than the waste of his body will explain. How is this accounted for, Dr Currie asks, unless by cutaneous absorption?\n\nThat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of these discharges above the ingesta and total waste, can be accounted for by absorption only, was indeed an irresistible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>. Still, however, cutaneous absorption is denied; and, when forced to confess, that there are cases where the egesta exceed the ingesta in a much greater proportion than the waste of the body will explain, and which can only be accounted for by absorption, they refuse this function to the skin, and below it most liberally, and, in so far as we know, most gratuitously, on the lungs. We are not entitled, in return, to deny the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of pulmonary absorption, but we may surely be allowed to urge, that there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the only inhaling organ is in the lungs; and there is none against the possibility of cutaneous absorption.\n\nIs it not, on the other hand, proved, by the experiments of Seguin and Lavoisier, that the exhalation greatly exceeds the absorption by the pulmonary system? And if this is always the case, we cannot explain by pulmonary inhalation alone, why the egesta should, in some cases, exceed the ingesta in a much greater proportion than the waste of the body will account for.\n\nWe now proceed to examine another class of experiments, much insisted on by those who deny cutaneous absorption; we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> those experiments performed by immersing a part of the body in solutions of active drugs, the absorption of which should be indicated by their usual effects on the system.\n\nSeguin made numerous experiments of this kind, with solutions of muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> (corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>), on typhilitic patients. And we are informed, that in cases where the epidermis was perfectly found, neither the known effects of mercury on the body, nor any amelioration of the venereal symptoms, was ever observed.\n\nHe also immersed his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> in a solution of two drams of the mercurial muriate in ten pounds of water. At the temperature of 12\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 R\u00e9aumur, no part of the salt was missing at the end of the experiment; but when the bath was at 18\u00b0 of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, there was a loss of one or two grains of the muriate in the hour, though the quantity of fluid was not diminished.\n\nThe explanation given by Seguin of this unexpected result is curiously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, but embarrassed, and inconsistent.\n\nAt the temperature of 12\u00b0, he observes, the exhalants are in a state of contraction, and their orifices nearly closed. When the heat again is raised to 26\u00b0, the exhalation is so rapid, that nothing can enter the vessels from without; but at 18\u00b0 of temperature, the orifices of the exhalants are sufficiently relaxed, and the exhalation at the same time so conveniently languid, that the solution rests quietly in contact with the matter of perspiration in the mouths of the exhalants, where it is somehow or other decomposed; a part of the salt leaving the water of solution, and combining with the perspirative matter, with which it is carried into the system *. Carried into the circulation by the exhalants! Is not this a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> acknowledgment of the reality of inhalation? But if in one case substances may thus be carried into the circulation, why not in many others?\n\nSurely if the weight continues undiminished, in circumstances\n\n(h) That thirst may be allayed by immersion in water, is fully proved by the experience of shipwrecked mariners, who, when obliged to take to their boats with very little fresh water, frequently have recourse to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> in the sea, or covering themselves with a shirt wetted in salt water, and thus quench their thirst, nearly as well as if they had drunk fresh water.\ncircumstances where the body is continually losing, we may infer, that something has been gained by absorption.\n\nAnd where the egesta exceed the ingesta in a proportion much greater than the waste of the body will explain, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABORTION\">abortion</a> must have been going on.\n\nThe case of Mr M\u2014, published by Dr Currie, is not singular. The writings of physicians abound in similar examples. They had often occurred to that excellent clinical practitioner De Haen, who was therefore persuaded that water was imbibed +. Haller too, with his usual industry, has collected a great many observations of the same kind \u2020.\n\nAgain, when physicians were engaged in their extensive statistical experiments, weighing themselves, their ingesta and egesta, for many months, nay for years together; they sometimes observed, that so far from losing, they had gained weight, especially during cold and moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Thus, Rye, under a cold and humid atmosphere, gained 13 ounces. Limnings, during two hours exposure to cold, acquired 8\u00bd ounces. The Abb\u00e9 Fontana, after two hours exposure to a moist atmosphere, returned home some ounces heavier than he went out. De Gorter gained 6 ounces in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>; and on other occasions, two ounces and four ounces. These observations are confirmed also by the experience of Dr Francis Home, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">Materia Medica</a> in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. Having fatigued myself pretty much (says he) in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, I went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, and was so hungry that I could not fall asleep for some time. Betwixt eleven at night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> next morning I had gained two ounces \u2021.\n\nHere then are examples of the body gaining considerably more than the ingesta will account for, acquiring weight when neither food nor drink had been swallowed. And we have the concurring testimony of the most respectable writers supporting the same truth.\n\nHow can this increase of weight be accounted for, unless by absorption? In such experiments, the loss of weight, which cannot be accounted for by the sensible egesta, is attributed to the exhalation; the increased weight sometimes observed, and which cannot be explained by the sensible ingesta, must in like manner be referred to the inhalation.\n\nThat the system may be affected by active medicines introduced and absorbed by the skin, cannot be denied. And were proofs still wanting to establish the doctrine of cutaneous absorption, this argument might be insisted on. It is true, that friction is commonly employed when we wish to introduce medicines by the skin, by which, it is said, the substance is mechanically forced through the cuticle, and brought into contact with the absorbents of the true skin. The system, however, may be affected without friction, for example, by wearing a mercurial platter, and more certainly by mercurial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a>, as practised by Lalonette and others *.\n\nIt might even be concluded from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the structure of the skin, that absorption must take place at its surface. We know that the cuticle is porous, and is penetrated by exhaling vessels; we know that lymphatics commence immediately below it; and we know that when certain substances are applied to the cuticle, especially when this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> is aided by moderate friction, as in the case of applying garlic poultices to the feet, and the more familiar instance of mercurial immersion, that these substances are taken up by the absorbents, and conveyed into the circulation.\n\nFrom a consideration of all these circumstances, we think it fully proved, that the skin is an absorbing or inhaling organ. For further proofs we may refer our readers to Bichat's Anat. Gener. tom. iv. p. 691.\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Darwin, son of the late Dr Darwin, published in 1782, a Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESIS\">thesis</a>, which is translated in the retrograde action of the lymphatics formed as in particular cases to admit of the regurgitation of the absorbed fluids. The arguments on which he founds this opinion (beside the difficulty of accounting for the phenomena of several diseases on any other principle), are chiefly the following:\n\nFirstly, The mouths of the lymphatics seem to allow water to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through them after death, the inverted way, more easily than in the natural direction.\n\nSecondly, In some diseases, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIABETES\">diabetes</a> and scrofula, it is probable the valves themselves are diseased, and are thence incapable of preventing the return of the fluids they should support.\n\nThirdly, There are valves in other parts of the body analogous to those of the absorbent system, which are liable, when diseased, to regurgitate their contents.\n\nFourthly, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> vessels, which must be considered as analogous to absorbents, may be seen, in animals submitted to the microscope, to regurgitate their contents into the arteries, during the struggles of the dying animal.\n\nBy means of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> (for notwithstanding the arguments adduced in its favour, we can call it no better), Mr Darwin explained the speedy passage of watery fluids from the stomach to the urinary bladder; the phenomena of diabetes; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIARRHOEA\">diarrhoea</a>, dropy, cold sweats; translations of matter, chyle, milk, and urine; the operation of external remedies, &c.\n\nIn all those classes of animals that possess a complete Absorption absorbent system, the phenomena of absorption seem to proceed much in the same manner as in man; but in some of the inferior animals, especially in mollusca and worms this function seems to be performed by the veins *. Cuvier in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECHINODERMATA\">echinodermata</a>, however, especially in the sea-urchins, echin (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECHINUS\">echinus</a> esculentus), lymphatics have been demonstrated by the second Monro. In insects and polypes there is no proper absorption.\n\nThe absorbing vessels of plants are chiefly the fibrils of the roots, which evidently imbibe moisture, and perhaps gaseous fluids, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; but there have also been demonstrated vessels opening beneath the outer bark, which botanical physiologists consider as lymphatics. \"Lymphatic vessels (says Wildenow), are found in the epidermis of plants, and are of great minuteness, anastomosing in various ways through small intermediate branches.\" They surround the apertures of the cuticle, by which the inhalation and exhalation of vegetables are carried on; but they are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> as not to have yet been filled with coloured liquids. Round each opening, which is commonly flat by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a>, they form a circle, rarely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHOMBUS\">rhombus</a>, as in the zea mays. In the lilium candidum, these vessels run obliquely, and somewhat in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> undulating manner, fig. 2.

It was a colony of Ionians, situated in the territory of A\u00ebolis, (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>). Massilia in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a> was again a colony from it. Phocaenae, the people, (Livy); Phocaicus, the epithet, (Lucan); applied to Marcellus. It was one of the 12 cities which assembled in the panionium or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of Ionia.\n\nSome writers tell us, that while the foundations of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> were laying, there appeared near the flore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> of sea-calves; whence it was called Ph\u0153cea, the word ph\u0153ce signifying in Greek a sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>. Ptolemy, who makes the river Hermus the boundary between A\u00ebolia and Ionia, places Ph\u0153cea in A\u00ebolis; but all other geographers reckon it among the cities of Ionia. It stood on the sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, between Cuma to the north, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a> to the south, not far from the Hermus; and was, in former times, one of the most wealthy and powerful cities of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>; but is now a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> beggarly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, though the see of a bishop. The Ph\u0153ceans were expert mariners, and the first among the Greeks that undertook <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> voyages; which they performed in galleys of fifty oars. As they applied themselves to trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, they became acquainted pretty early with the coasts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, where they are said to have founded several cities, namely, Velia in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; Alalia, or rather Aleria, in Corica; and Marcellis in Gaul. Neither were they unacquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; for Herodotus tells us, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> the Great, the Ph\u0153ceans arriving at Sartellus, a city in the bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, were treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> kindness by Arganthonius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; who, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> that they were under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the growing power of Cyrus, invited them to leave Ionia, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> they pleased. The Ph\u0153ceans could not be prevailed upon to forsake their country; but accepted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> generously presented them with, to defray the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a strong wall round their city. The wall they built on their return; but it was unable to resist the mighty power of Cyrus, whose general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARPAGUS\">Harpagus</a>, investing the city with a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, soon reduced it to the utmost extremities. The Ph\u0153ceans, having no hopes of any succour, offered to capitulate; but the conditions offered by Harpagus seeming severe, they begged he would allow them three days to deliberate; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, withdraw his forces. Harpagus, though not ignorant of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, complied with their request. The Ph\u0153ceans, taking advantage of this concession, put their wives, children, and all their most valuable effects, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> several vessels which they had ready equipped, and conveyed them safe to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Chios, leaving the Persians in possession of empty houses. Their design was to purchase the Oeneian islands, which belonged to the Chians, and settle there. But the Chians not caring to have them so near, left they should enrol all the trade to themselves, as they were a seafaring people, they put to sea again; and, having taken Ph\u0153cea, their native country, by surprize, put all the Persians they found in it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. They went to Corica; great part of them however returned very soon, as did the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> also in a few years. They then lived in subjection either to the Persians, or tyrants of their own. Among the latter we find mention made of Laodamus, who attended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> Hydaspes in his expedition against the Scythians; and of Dionysius, who, joining Ariarathes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILETUS\">Miletus</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> author of the Ionian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a>, retired, after the defeat of his countrymen, to Ph\u0153cia, where he made an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOOTY\">booty</a>, seizing on all the ships he met with trading to that country. From Ph\u0153cia he sailed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, where he committed great depredations on the Carthaginians and Tuscans; but is said never to have molested the Greeks.\n\nIn the Roman times the city of Ph\u0153cea sided with Antiochus.\nAntiochus the Great; whereupon it was besieged, taken, and plundered, by the Roman general; but allowed to be governed by its own laws. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which Artilonius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to Attalus, king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERGAMUS\">Pergamus</a>, raised against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, they afflicted the former to the utmost of their power; a circumstance which so dispirited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, that they commanded the town to be demolished, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of the Phocaens to be utterly rooted out. This severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> would have been put in execution, had not the Maffilenses, a Phocaean colony, interposed, and, with much difficulty, assuaged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of the senate. Pompey declared Phoc\u00e6a a free city, and restored the inhabitants to all the privileges they had ever enjoyed; whence, under the first emperors, it was reckoned one of the most flourishing cities of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>. This is all we have been able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> touching the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Phoc\u00e6a.","sp":7,"ep":8},{"h":"PHOCAS","t":"a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a>, was raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and was crowned at Constantinople about the year 653. The emperor Mauritius, who was thus deserted both by the army and the people, fled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a> with his five children, whom Phocas caused to be inhumanly murdered before his eyes, and then he murdered Mauritius himself, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, and several other persons who were attached to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>.\n\nPhocas, thus proclaimed and acknowledged at Constantinople, sent, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> and that of his wife Leontia to Rome, where they were received with loud acclamations, the people there being incensed against Mauritius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the cruel exactions of the exarchs, and his other ministers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. Gregory, surnamed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a>, then bishop of Rome, vaunted the images to be lodged in the oratory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> Caesarius, and wrote letters to the new emperor, congratulating him upon his advancement to the throne, which he said was effected by a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>, to deliver the people from the innumerable calamities and heavy oppressions under which they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> groaned. Had we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other character of Phocas and Leontia but that which has been conveyed to us in Gregory's letters, we should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> him amongst the best princes mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; but all other writers paint him in quite different colours; and his actions, transmitted to us by several historians, evidently speak him a most cruel and blood-thirsty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>. He was of middling stature, says Cedrenus, deformed, and of a terrible aspect: his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, his eye-brows met, and one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> was marked with a scar, which, when he was in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, grew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and frightful: he was greatly addicted to wine and women, blood-thirsty, inexorable, bold in speech, a stranger to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>, in his principles a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERETIC\">heretic</a>. He endeavoured, in the beginning of his reign, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the affections of the people by celebrating the Circenian games with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> pomp, and distributing on that occasion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sums among the people; but finding that instead of applauding they reviled him as a drunkard, he ordered his guards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon them. Some were killed, many wounded, and great numbers were dragged to prison: but the populace rising, set them at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and thenceforth conceived an irreconcileable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to the tyrant.\n\nAs soon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mauritius was known, Narzes, who then commanded the troops quartered on the frontiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, revolted. Phocas, however, managed matters so as to gain him over to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and then treacherously and cruelly burnt him alive. He endeavoured to strengthen his cause by respectable alliances; but his cruelty was such as to render him generally hated, for he spared neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and amongst others he murdered Constantina the widow of Mauritius, and her daughters. These cruelties were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the cause of his downfall. He became universally hateful; and persons in great authority near his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> conspired against him. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, however, was discovered, and the persons concerned in it were all put to death. The following year, however, 618, he was overtaken by the fate he had so long deserved.\n\nHeraclius, the son of the governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, who bore the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, taking upon him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of emperor, and being acknowledged as such by the people of Africa, sailed from thence with a formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, and a powerful army on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, for Constantinople, while Nicetas marched thither by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTAPOLIS\">Pentapolis</a>. Heraclius steered his course to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYDUS\">Abydus</a>, where he was received with great demonstrations of joy by several persons of rank, who had been banished by Phocas. From Abydus he sailed to Constantinople, where he engaged and utterly defeated the tyrant's fleet. Phocas took refuge in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>; but one Photinus, whose wife he had formerly debauched, pursuing him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, forced the gates, dragged the cowardly emperor from the throne, and having stripped him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> robes, and clothed him with a black vest, carried him in chains to Heraclius, who commanded first his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and feet, then his arms, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, to be cut off: the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his body was delivered up to the soldiers, who burnt it in the forum. We are told, that Heraclius having reproached him with his evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, he answered, with great calmness, \"It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> upon you to govern better.\" Such was the end of this cruel tyrant, after he had reigned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years and some months.","sp":8,"ep":8},{"h":"PHOCILIDES","t":"a Greek poet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILETUS\">Miletus</a>, flourished about 540 years before the Christian era. The poetical piece now extant, attributed to him, is not of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, but of another poet who lived in the reign of Adrian.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHOCION\">PHOCION</a> was a distinguished Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> and orator in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. of Macedon. His character is thus described in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>. \"He was too modest to solicit command, nor did he promote wars that he might raise his authority by them; though, taken either as a soldier, orator, statesman, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> general, he was by far the most eminent Athenian of his time. As he was a most disinterested patriot, he could entertain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> affection for Philip: but as he perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> knew the disposition of his countrymen, and how unlikely they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> to support such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> as were necessary to humble the Macedonian power, he did not express himself vehemently, but chose rather to cultivate the esteem which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> all occasions Philip showed for the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> of preserving her, when she should be reduced to that situation which he conceived they wanted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> to prevent. From this character the reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> easily discern that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a>\nDemosthenes and he could not well agree. The former was always warm, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> copious, and his designs extensive; and Phocion, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, was of a mild temper, delivered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in very few words, and propounded schemes at once necessary and easy to be effected. Yet he seldom or never concurred with the people, but spoke so poignantly against their vices as Demosthenes himself; inasmuch that this orator once told him, 'The Athenians, Phocion, in some of their mad fits, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> thee.' 'The same (answered he) may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to thee, Demosthenes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> ever they come to be sober.'\n\nHe was afterwards appointed to command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> which was sent to assist the Byzantines against Philip, whom he obliged to return to his own dominions. This truly great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, whom (though extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>) no sum could bribe to betray his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and who at every risk on all occasions gave them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> advice, was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> accused by his ungrateful countrymen. This event happened in the year before Christ 318. He was sent to Athens by Polyperchon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, together with his friends, chained in carts, with this message, \"That though he was convinced they were traitors, yet he left them to be judged by the Athenians as a free people.\" Phocion demanded whether they intended to proceed against him by form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; and some crying out that they would, Phocion demanded how that could be if they were not allowed a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>: but perceiving, by the clamour of the people, that no such thing was to be expected, he exclaimed, \"As for myself, I confess the crime objected to me, and submit to the judgement of the law; but consider, O ye Athenians, what have these poor innocent men done that they should be involved in the same calamity with me?\" The people replied with great vociferation, \"They are your accomplices, and that is enough.\" Then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was read, adjudging them all to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, viz. Phocion, Nicocles, Aedipidus, Agamorn, and Pythocles; these were present: Demetrius, Phalereus, Callimedon, Charicles, and others, were condemned in their absence. Some moved that Phocion might be tortured before he was put to death; nay, they were for bringing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, and torturing him there. The majority, however, thought it enough if he was put to death, for which the decree was carried unanimously; some putting on garlands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> when they gave their votes. As he was going to execution, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who was his intimate friend asked him if he had any message for his son? \"Yes,\" replied Phocion; \"tell him it is my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> command that he forget how ill the Athenians treated his father.\"\n\nThe spleen of his enemies was not extinguished with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>: they passed a decree whereby his corpse was banished the Athenian territories; they likewise forbade any Athenians to furnish fire for his funeral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a>. One Conopian took up the corpse, and carried it beyond Eleusina, where he borrowed some fire of a Megarian woman and burned it. A Megarian matron, who attended with her maid, raised on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> an honorary monument; and having gathered up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, carried them home, and buried them under her own hearth; praying at the same time thus to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENATES\">Penates</a>: \"To you, O ye gods, guardians of this place, I commit the precious remains of the most excellent Phocion. Protect them, I beseech you, from all insults; and deliver them one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to be reposed in the sepulchre of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, when the Athenians shall become wiser.\" It was not long before this opportunity occurred. When the Athenians began to cool a little, and remember the many services they had received from Phocion, they decreed him a statue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>; ordered his bones to be brought back at the public expense; and decreed that his accusers should be put to death.

Its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> was from north to south, that is, from $38^\\circ 45'$ to $39^\\circ 20'$, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> about 35 miles; but very narrow from east to west, not extending to 30 miles, that is, from $23^\\circ 15'$ to $23^\\circ 45'$ at the widest, but about 23 miles towards the Corinthian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, and much narrower still towards the north. This country is generally allowed to have taken its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from Phocus the son of Ornytion, a native of Corinth; but having been soon after invaded by the Eginetae, under the conduct of another Phocus, who was the son of Eacus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Enoplia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the first infallibly gave way to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>.\n\nIn Phocis there were many celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, such as Cytharoon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELICON\">Helicon</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a>.

Both it and Helicon contend with Mount Parnassus for height and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>. There were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> in Phocis except Cephissus, which runs from the foot of Parnassus northward, and empties itself in the Pindus, which was near the boundary of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. It had several very considerable cities; such as Cyrra, Griffa, and Anticyra, which, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, were on the sea coasts; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHIA\">Pythia</a>, Delphi, Daulis, Elatia, Ergothemia, and Baulia, which were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>. Elatia was the largest and richest after Delphi.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEUCALION\">Deucalion</a> was king of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Phocis which lies about Parnassus, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CECROPS\">Cecrops</a> flourished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>; but the Phocians afterwards formed themselves into a commonwealth, to be governed by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> assemblies, the members of which were chosen from among themselves, and were changed as often as occasion required. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the Phocians but little is known till the time of the holy war, of which\nwe have the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History.\n\n\"The Phocians having presumed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> the territories of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Cyrra, consecrated to the Delphic god, were summoned by the other Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHICTYONS\">Amphictyons</a>, where a considerable fine was imposed upon them for their sacrilege. They refused to pay it, on pretence that it was too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; and at the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> their dominions were adjudged confiscated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the temple. This second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> exasperated the Phocians still more; who, at the instigation of one Philomelus, or, as he is called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, Philomedes, seized upon the temple, plundered it of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, and held the sacred depositum for a considerable time. This second crime occasioned another assembly of the Amphictyons, the result of which was a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of war against the Phocians. The quarrel being become more general, the several states took part in it according to their inclinations or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, and some others of the Peloponnesians, declared for the Phocians; and the Thebans, Thessalians, Locrians, and other neighbouring states, against them. A war was commenced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> fury on both sides, and styled the holy war, which lasted ten years; during which the Phocians, having hired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of foreign troops, made an obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> have held out much longer had not Philip of Macedon given the finishing stroke to their total defeat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. The war being ended, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> assembled again, and imposed an annual fine of 65 talents upon the Phocians, to be paid to the temple, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till they had fully repaired the damage it had sustained from them; and, till this reparation should be made, they were excluded from dwelling in walled towns, and from having any vote in the grand assembly. They did not, however, continue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> under this heavy sentence: their known bravery made their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> so necessary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, that they were glad to remit it; after which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> they continued to behave with their usual courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, and soon obliterated their former guilt.\"\n\nWe cannot finish this article without mentioning more particularly Daulis, rendered famous, not so much for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> or richness, as for the stature and prowess of its inhabitants; but still more for the inhuman repast which was served up to Tereus king of Thrace by the women of this city, by whom he was soon after murdered for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> injury he had done to his sister-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOMELA\">Philomela</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Pandonion king of Athens.

Whence it borrowed its name is not absolutely certain. Some derive it from Ancient one Phoenix; others from the Greek word phanix, fig-tree. Hyft. nifying a palm or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, as that tree remarkably abound ed in this country. Some again suppose that Phoenice is originally a translation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> word Edom, from the Edomites who fled thither in the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a> it was also called Chna, and anciently Rhabbothin and Colpis (A). The Jews <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> named it Canaan; though some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it, at least, they knew by the name of Syrophoenice (B). Bochart tells us that the most probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> is Phene <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANAK\">Anak</a>, i.e., \"the descendants of Anak.\" Such were the names peculiar to this small country; though Phoenice was sometimes extended to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> countries of Syria and Judea, and Canaan to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILISTINES\">Philistines</a>, and even to the Amalekites. On the contrary, these two names, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, were most generally followed up by those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> and Syria (C).\n\nThere is some disagreement among authors with respect to the northern limits of this country. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> makes the river Eleutherus the boundary of Phoenice to the north; but Pliny, Mela, and Stephanus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARADUS\">Aradus</a>, lying north of that river. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> observes, that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have the river Eleutherus to be the boundary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SELEUCIA\">Seleucia</a>, on the side of Phoenice and Coele-Syria. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Phoenice, and south of the river Eleutherus, stood the following cities: SIMYRA, Orthofoa, TRIPOLIS, Botrys, Byblus, Palaebyblus, Berytus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIDON\">SIDON</a>, SAREPTA, TYRUS, PALETYRUS.\n\nPhoenice extended, according to Ptolemy, even beyond Mount Carmel; for that geographer places in Phoenice not only Ecdippa and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>, but Sycaminum and Dera, which stand south of that mountain. These, however, properly speaking, belonged to Palestine. We will not take upon us to mark out the bounds of the midland Phoenice. Ptolemy reckons in it the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCA\">Arca</a>, Palaebyblus (Old Byblus), Gabala, and Caesarea Paniae. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> was considerably extended in the times of Christianity; when, being considered as a province of Syria, it included not only Damascus but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALMYRA\">Palmyra</a> also.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of this country is good, and productive of many necessaries for food and clothing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is wholesome, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> agreeable. It is plentifully watered by small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>; which, running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from Mount Libanus, sometimes swell to an immoderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, either increased by the melting of the snows on that mountain, or by heavy rains. Upon these occasions they overflow, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> danger and hinderance of the traveller and damage of the country. Among these rivers is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADONIS\">ADONIS</a>.\n\n(A) This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> name is a translation of the first. Rabbothen is in Hebrew a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. From rabbothen, by changing the Hebrew r into the Greek r, comes rabboten; and, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>, rhabbothin. Kolpos, colpos, is Greek also for a bay or gulf; whence it appears that colpis or colpites is a translation of rhabbothin.\n\n(B) Bochart supposes that the borderers, both upon the Phoenician and Syrian side, were called by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> name of Syrophoenicians, as partaking equally of both nations.\n\n(C) Or rather Phoenice, Palestine, and Syria, were promiscuously used for each other, and particularly the two former. Phoenice and Palestine, says Stephanus Byzantinus, were the same. As for Syria, we have already observed, that in its largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> it sometimes comprehended Phoenice and Coele-Syria. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> plainly confounds these three names; we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, uses one for the other indifferently.\nIt is universally allowed that the Phoenicians were Canaanites (D) by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>; nothing is plainer or less contested, and therefore it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> lost to prove it. We shall only add, that their blood must have been mixed with that of foreigners in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, as it happens in all trading places; and that many strange families must have settled among them, who could consequently lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> claim to this remote origin, how muchsoever they may have been called Phoenicians, and reckoned of the same descent with the ancient proprietors.\n\nThe Phoenicians were governed by kings; and their territory, as small as it was, included several kingdoms; namely, those of Sidon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, Aradus, Berytus, and Byblus. In this particular they imitated and adhered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of their forefathers; who, like the other Canaanites, were under many petty princes, to whom they allowed the foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, referring to themselves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and liberties of mankind. Of their civil laws we have no particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>.\n\nWith regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, the Phoenicians were the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and abominable idolaters. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAAL_BERITH\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAAL\">Baal</a>-berith, Baalzebub, Baalsamen, &c., mentioned in Scripture, were some of the Phoenician gods; as were also the Moloch, Ashtaroth, and Thammuz, mentioned in the sacred writings.\u2014The word Baal, in itself an appellative, was no doubt applied to the true God, until he rejected it on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its being so much profaned by the idolaters. The name was not appropriated to any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a> among the idolatrous nations, but was common to many; however, it was generally imagined that one great God presided over all the rest. Among the Phoenicians this deity was named Baal-samen; whom the Hebrews would have called Baal-jhemin, or the God of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> this was also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> Carthaginian deity, though his Punic name is unknown. We have many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of the Carthaginians handed down to us by the Greek and Roman writers; but they all bestowed names of their own gods upon those of the Carthaginians, which leads us to a knowledge of the correspondence between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the Phoenician and European deities. The principal deity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, according to Diodorus Siculus, was Chronos or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>. The sacrifices offered up to him were children of the best families. Our author also tells us, that the Carthaginians had a brazen statue or colossus of this god, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of which were extended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> to receive, and bent downwards in such a manner, that the child laid thereon immediately fell down into a hollow where there was a fiery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>. He adds also, that this inhuman practice seemed to confirm a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, handed down to the Greeks from very early antiquity, viz. that Saturn devoured his own children.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> Coelitis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URANIA\">Urania</a>, was held in the highest veneration by the Carthaginians. She is thought to have been the same with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of heaven mentioned in Jeremiah, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNO\">Juno</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIA\">Olympia</a> of the Greeks. According to Helychius, the same word applied in the Punic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> both to Juno and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a>: Nay, the ancient Greeks frequently confound Juno, Venus, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, all together; which is to be attributed to the Egyptians and Phoenicians, from whom they received their system of religion; who seem in the most ancient times to have had but one name for them all. Besides these there were several other deities of later date, who were worshipped among the Phoenicians, particularly those of Tyre, and consequently among the Carthaginians also. These were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>. Jupiter was worshipped under the name of Belus or Baal. To him they addressed their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>; and placed him for the most part, as there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of their treaties. The same name was also given to the other two, whence they were frequently mistaken for one another. Apollo or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, went either by this name simply, or by others of which this made a part.\n\nThe Carthaginian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, however, was not confined to these deities alone. They worshipped also the fire, air, and other elements; and had gods of rivers, meads, &c. Nay, they paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> honours to the spirits of their heroes, and even to men and women themselves while yet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a> the Great had for some time a share, notwithstanding the infamous conduct of his countrymen towards him at last. In order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> these gods with more convenience on all occasions, the Carthaginians had a kind of portable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>. These were only covered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>, in which were some small images representing their favourite deities; and which were drawn by oxen. They were also a kind of oracle; and their responses were understood by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> impressed upon the vehicle. This was likewise an Egyptian or Libyan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>; and Tacitus informs us that the ancient Germans had something of the same kind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a> of Moloch is thought to have been a machine of this kind; and it is not improbable that the whole was derived from the tabernacle of the Jews in the wilderness.\n\nBesides all the deities above-mentioned, we still find another, named the Demon or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">Genius</a> of Carthage, mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> of Macedon and Hannibal. What this deity might be, we know not; however, it may be observed, that the pagan world in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> believed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of demons, or intelligences who had a kind of middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> between gods and men, and to whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of the world was in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> committed. Hence it is no wonder that they should have received religious honours. For when once mankind were possessed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that they were the ministers of the gods, and trusted with the dispensation of their favours, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the infliction\n\n(D) Bochart infers that the Canaanites were ashamed of their name, on account of the curse denounced on their progenitors, and terrified by the wars so vigorously and successfully waged on them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a>, purely because they were Canaanites; and that therefore, to avoid the ignominy of the one and the danger of the other, they abjured their old name, and changed it for Phoenicians, Syrians, Syrophoenicians, and Assyrians. Heidegger conjectures also that they were ashamed of their ancestor Canaan.\nPhoenicia: fiction of their punishments, it is natural to suppose that they would be desirous of making their addresses to them. See Astarte and Polytheism.\n\nHerodotus supposes the Phoenicians to have been circumcised; but Josephus affirms, that none of the nations included under the vague name of Palestine and Syria used that rite, the Jews excepted; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the Phoenicians had anciently that custom, they came in time to neglect it, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> wholly laid it aside. They obtained however from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of swine.\n\nMuch is said of their arts, sciences, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>; but as what we find concerning them is couched in general terms only, we cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCANT\">descant</a> on particulars. The Sidonians, under which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> we comprehend the Phoenicians in general, were of most happy genius. They were from the beginning addicted to philosophical exercises of the mind; inasmuch that a Sidonian, by name Mochus, taught the doctrine of atoms before the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and Abomenus of Tyre puzzled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> by the subtlety of his questions. Phoenice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be one of the seats of learning, and both Tyre and Sidon produced their philosophers of later ages; namely, Boethus and Diodatus of Sidon, Antipater of Tyre, and Appollonius of the same place; who gave an account of the writings and disciples of Zeno. For their language, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOLOGY\">Philology</a>, no. 61.\n\nAs to their manufactures, the glafs of Sidon, the purple of Tyre, and the exceeding fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> they wove, were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of their own country, and their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; and for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> skill in working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, in hewing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; in a word, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> knowledge of what was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, great, and ornamental in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>\u2014we need only put the reader in mind of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> share they had in erecting and decorating the temple at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> Hiram. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> invention, was such, that whatever was elegant, great, or pleasing, whether in apparel, vessels, or toys, was distinguished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of excellence with the epithet of Sidonian.\n\nThe Phoenicians were likewise celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, navigators, and planters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> in foreign parts. As merchants, they may be said to have engrossed all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of the western world; as navigators, they were the boldest, the most experienced, and greatest discoverers, of the ancient times: they had for many ages no rivals. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> colonies they exerted themselves so much, that, considering their habitation was little more than the slip of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> between Mount Libanus and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, it is surprising how they could furnish such supplies of people; and not wholly depopulate their native country.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the Phoenicians were induced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in foreign commodities by their neighbourhood with the Syrians, who were perhaps the most ancient of those who carried on a considerable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> trade with the more eastern regions; and this conjecture appears probable at least; for their own territory was but small, and little able to afford any considerable exports, if we except manufactures: but that their manufactures were anyways considerable till they began to turn all the channels of trade into their own country, it is hard to believe. In Syria, which was a large country, they found store of productions of the natural growth of that soil, and many choice and useful commodites brought from the east. Thus, having Phoenicia, a safe coast, with convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, on one side, and excellent materials for ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> on the other; perceiving how acceptable many commodities that Syria furnished would be in foreign parts, and being at the same time, perhaps, thrown the way by the Syrians themselves, who may have navigated the Mediterranean\u2014they turned all their thoughts to trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, and by an uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> soon eclipsed their masters in that art.\n\nIt were in vain to talk of the Edomites, who fled hither in David's time; or to inquire why Herodotus supposes the Phoenicians came from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Sea: their origin we have already seen. That some of the Edomites fled into this country in the days of David, and that they were a trading people, is very evident: what improvements they brought with them into Phoenice, it is hard to say; and by the way, it is as difficult to ascertain their numbers. In all probability they brought with them a knowledge of the Red Sea, and of the fourth parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and Ethiopia; and by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> made the Phoenicians acquainted with those coasts; by which means they were enabled to undertake voyages to those parts, for Solomon, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECHO\">Necho</a>, king of Egypt.\n\nTheir whole thoughts were employed on schemes to advance their commerce. They affected no empire but that of the sea; and seemed to aim at nothing but the peaceable enjoyment of their trade. This they extended to all the known parts they could reach; to the British isles, commonly understood by the Caliderides; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and other places in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, both within and without the straits of Gibraltar; and, in general, to all the ports of the Mediterranean, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Sea, and the lake Maeotis. In all these parts they had settlements and correspondents, from which they drew what was useful to themselves, or might be so to others; and thus they exercised the three great branches of trade, as it is commonly divided into importation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>, and transportation, in full latitude. Such was their sea-trade; and for that which they carried on by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in Syria, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MESOPOTAMIA\">Mesopotamia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLONIA\">Babylonia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, Arabia, and even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, it was of no less extent, and may give us an idea of what this people once was, how rich and how deservedly their merchants are mentioned in Scripture as equal to princes. Their country was, at that time, the great warehouse, where every thing that might either administer to the necessities or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of mankind was to be found; which they distributed as they judged would be the best for their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The purple of Tyre, the glafs of Sidon, and the exceeding fine linen made in this country, together with other curious pieces of art in metals and wood, already mentioned, appear to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> and almost only commodities of Phoenice itself. Indeed their territory was so small, that it is not to be imagined they could afford to export any of their own growth; it is more likely that they rather wanted than abounded with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>.\n\nHaving thus spoken in general terms of their trade, we shall now touch upon their shipping and some things remarkable in their navigation. Their larger embarkations were of two sorts; they divided them into round ships or gauli; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ships, galleys, or triremes. When they drew up in line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, the gauli were dif-\nposed at a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from each other in the wings, or in the van and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a>; their triremes were contracted together in the centre. If, at any time, they observed that a stranger kept them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> in their voyage, or followed in their track, they were sure to get rid of him if they could, or deceive him if possible; in which policy they went so far, as to venture the loss of their ships, and even their lives; so jealous were they of foreigners, and so tenaciously bent on keeping the whole trade to themselves. In order to discourage other nations from engaging in commerce, they practised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRACY\">piracy</a>, or pretended to be at war with such as they met when they thought themselves strongest. This was but a natural stroke of policy in people who grasped at the whole commerce of the then known world. We must not forget here the famous fishery of Tyre, which, to remarkably enriched that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> Index. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this valuable plant already given in its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, under Botany, is rather short to be satisfactory, we shall here enter a little more into the detail of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. There is only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, viz. the daetylifera, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> date-tree, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> and eastern countries, where it grows to 50, 60, and 100 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> is round, upright, and fluted with protuberances, which are the vestiges of the decayed leaves. From the top issues forth a cluster of leaves or branches eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, extending all around like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UMBRELLA\">umbrella</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> a little towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> produces a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of stalks like those of the middle, but seldom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> to high as four or five feet. These stalks, says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAMANT\">Adamant</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> the tree very considerably; so that, wherever it naturally grows in forests, it is extremely difficult to open a passage through its prickly leaves. The date-tree was introduced into Jamaica soon after the conquest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> by the Spaniards. There are however, but few of them in Jamaica at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. The fruit is somewhat in the shape of an acorn. It is composed of a thin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and glossy membrane, somewhat pellucid and yellowish; which contains a fine, soft, and pulpy fruit, which is firm, sweet, and somewhat vinous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, excellent, and wholesome; and within this is inclosed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, tough, and hard kernel, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> grey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the outside, and finely marbled within like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a>. For medicinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> dates are to be chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, full, fresh, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, soft and tender, not too much wrinkled; such as have a vinous taste, and do not rattle when shaken. They are produced in many parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, but never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> perfectly there. The best are brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>; they are also very fine and good in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and in many parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>. Those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and France look <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>; but are never perfectly ripe, and very subject to decay. They are preserved three different ways; some preserved and dry; others pressed more moderately, and again moistened with their own juice; and others not pressed at all, but moistened with the juice of other dates, as they are packed up, which is done in baskets or skins. Those preserved in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> are much the best. Dates Phoenix, have always been esteemed moderately strengthening and alluring.\n\nThough the date tree grows everywhere indiscriminately on the northern coasts of Africa, it is not cultivated with care, except beyond Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a>; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is not sufficiently powerful along the coasts to bring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> to proper maturity. We shall here extract some observations from Mr. Des Fontaines respecting the manner of cultivating it in Barbary, and on the different uses to which it is applied. All that part of the Zara which is near Mount Atlas, and the only part of this vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> which is inhabited, produces very little corn; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, and burnt up by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, is almost entirely unfit for the cultivation of grain, its only productions of that kind being a little barley, maize, and forgo. The date-tree, however, supplies the deficiency of corn to the inhabitants of these countries, and furnishes them with almost the whole of their subsistence. They have flocks of sheep; but as they are not numerous, they prefer them for the sake of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>; besides, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of these animals is very unwholesome food in countries that are excessively warm; and these people, though ignorant, have probably been enabled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to know that it was salutary for them to abstain from it. The date trees are planted without any order, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of 12 feet one from the other, in the neighbourhood of rivulets and streams which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. Forests of them may be seen here and there, some of which are several leagues in circumference. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of these plantations depends upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which can be procured to water them; for they require much moisture. All these forests are intermixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMOND\">almond</a>, and pomegranate trees, and with vines which twist round the trunks of the date trees; and the heat is strong enough to ripen the fruit, though they are never exposed to the sun.\n\nAlong the rivulets and streams, dykes are erected to stop the course of their waters, in order that they may be distributed amongst the date trees by means of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>. The number of canals is fixed for each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>; and in several cantons, to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to them, the proprietors are obliged to pay an annual sum proportionable to the number and extent of their plantations. Care is taken to till the earth well, and to raise a circular border around the root of each tree, that the water may remain longer and in larger quantity. The date trees are watered in every season, but more particularly during the great heats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nIt is generally in winter that new plantations of this tree are formed. For this purpose those who cultivate them take shoots of those which produce the best dates, and plant them at a small distance one from the other. At the end of three or four years these shoots, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they have been properly taken care of, begin to bear fruit; but this fruit is as yet dry, without sweetness, and even without kernels; they never reach the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of which they are susceptible till they are about 15 or 20 years old.\n\nThese plants are however produced from the seeds taken out of the fruit, provided they are fresh. They should be sown in pots filled with light rich earth, and plunged into a moderate hotbed of tanners bark, which\nshould be kept in a moderate temperature of heat, and the earth frequently refreshed with water. When the plants are come up to a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, they should be each planted in a separate small pot, filled with the same light earth, and plunged into a hotbed again, observing to refresh them with water, as also to let them have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the warmth of the season and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> in which they are placed. During the summer time they should remain in the same hotbed; but in the beginning of August, they should have a great share of air to harden them against the approach of winter; for if they are too much forced, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be so tender as not to be preserved through the winter without much difficulty, especially if you have not the conveniency of a bark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a> to keep them in. The soil in which these plants should be placed, must be composed in the following manner, viz. half of light fresh earth taken from a pasture-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the other half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and rotten dung or tanners bark in equal proportion; these should be carefully mixed, and laid in a heap three or four months at least before it is used, but should be often turned over to prevent the growth of weeds, and to sweeten the earth.\n\nThe trees, however, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from seed never produce so good dates as those that are raised from shoots; they being always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and ill tasted. It is undoubtedly by force of cultivation, and after several generations, that they acquire a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>.\n\nThe date trees which have been originally sown, grow rapidly, and we have been assured that they bear fruit in the fourth or fifth year. Care is taken to cut the inferior branches of the date tree in proportion as they rise; and a piece of the root is always left of some inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, which affords the easy means of climbing to the summit. These trees live a long time, according to the account of the Arabs; and in order to prove it, they say that when they have attained to their full growth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> change is observed in them for the space of three generations.\n\nThe number of females which are cultivated is much superior to that of the males, because they are much more profitable. The sexual organs of the date tree grow, as is well known, upon different stalks, and these trees flower in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> and May, at which time the Arabs cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> branches to impregnate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>. For this purpose, they make an incision in the trunk of each branch which they wish to produce fruit, and place in it a stalk of male <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>; without this precaution the date tree would produce only abortive fruit (A). In some cantons the male branches are only shaken over the female. The practice of impregnating the date tree in this manner is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>. Pliny describes it very accurately in that part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> where he treats of the palm tree.\n\nThere is scarcely any part of the date tree which is not useful. The wood, though of a spongy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, lasts such a number of years, that the inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> say it is incorruptible. They employ it for making beams and instruments of husbandry; it burns slowly, but the coals which result from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> are very strong, and produce a great heat.\n\nThe Arabs strip the bark and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> parts from the young date trees, and eat the substance which is in the centre; it is very nourishing, and has a sweet taste: it is known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the marrow of the date tree. They eat also the leaves, when they are young and tender, with lemon juice; the old ones are laid out to dry, and are employed for making mats and other works of the same kind, which are much used, and with which they carry on a considerable trade in the interior parts of the country. From the sides of the stumps of the branches which have been left arise a great number of delicate filaments, of which they make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, and which might serve to fabricate cloth.\n\nOf the fresh dates and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, says Haffelquill, the Egyptians make a conserve, which has a very pleasant taste. In Egypt they use the leaves as fly-flaps, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> away the numerous insects which prove troublesome in hot countries. The hard boughs are used for fences and other purposes of husbandry; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> item for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. The fruit, before it is ripe, is somewhat astringent; but when thoroughly mature, is of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the fig. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a> dates are shorter than those of Egypt, but much thicker in the pulp, which is said to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a> agreeable taste, superior to that of the best dates of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> liquor, known by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, is drawn also from the date tree. To obtain it, all the branches are cut from the summit of one of these trees, and after several incisions have been made in it, they are covered with leaves, in order that the heat of the sun may not dry it.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> drops <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into a vessel placed to receive it, at the bottom of a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, made below the incisions. The milk of the date tree has a sweet and agreeable taste when it is new; it is very refreshing, and it is even given to sick people to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>, but it generally turns sour at the end of 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. Old trees are chosen for this operation, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> of the branches, and the large quantity of sap which flows from them, greatly exhaust them, and often cause them to decay.\n\nThe male flowers of the date tree are also useful. They\n\n---\n\n(A) The celebrated Linn\u00e6us, in his Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants, speaking of the date tree, says, \"A female date-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> palm flowered many years at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> without producing any seeds; but the Berlin people taking care to have some of the blossoms of the male tree, which was then flowering at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, sent to them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, they obtained fruit by these means; and some dates, the offspring of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>, being planted in my garden, sprung up, and to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> continue to grow vigorously. Kemper formerly told us, how necessary it was found by the oriental people, who live upon the produce of palm-trees, and are the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTOPHAGI\">Lotophagi</a>, to plant some male trees among the females, if they hoped for any fruit: hence it is the practice of those who make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in that part of the world to cut down all the male palms, that a famine may afflict their proprietors; sometimes even the inhabitants themselves destroy the male trees when they dread an invasion, that their enemies may find no sustenance in the country.\"\nPhoenix. They are eaten when still tender, mixed up with a little lemon juice. They are reckoned to be very provocative; the odour which they exhale is probably the cause of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> being ascribed to them.\n\nThese date trees are very lucrative to the inhabitants of the desert. Some of them produce 20 bunches of dates; but care is always taken to lop off a part of them, that those which remain may become larger; 10 or 12 bunches only are left on the most vigorous trees.\n\nIt is reckoned that a good tree produces, one year with another, about the value of 10 or 12 shillings to the proprietor. A pretty considerable trade is carried on with dates in the interior part of the country, and large quantities of them are exported to France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. The crop is gathered towards the end of November. When the bunches are taken from the tree, they are hung up in some very dry place where they may be sheltered and secure from insects.\n\nDates afford wholesome nourishment, and have a very agreeable taste when they are fresh. The Arabs eat them without leavening. They dry and harden them in the sun, to reduce them to a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, which they lay up in store to supply themselves with food during the long journeys which they often undertake across their deserts. This simple food is sufficient to nourish them for a long time.\u2014The inhabitants of the Zara procure also from their dates a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> which is exceedingly sweet. For this purpose they choose those which have the softest pulp; and having put them into a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAR\">jar</a> with a hole in the bottom, they squeeze them by placing over them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of eight or ten pounds.\u2014The moist fluid part of the substance, which drops through the hole, is what they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the honey of the date.\n\nEven the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, though very hard, are not thrown away. They give them to their camels and sheep as food, after they have bruised them or laid them to soften in water.\n\nThe date, as well as other trees which are cultivated, exhibits great variety in its fruit, with respect to shape, size, quality, and even colour. There are reckoned to be at least twenty different kinds. Dates are very liable to be pierced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, and they soon corrupt in moist or rainy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>.\n\nFrom what has been said, it may easily be perceived, that there is, perhaps, no tree whatever used for so many and so valuable purposes as the date tree.\n\nPhoenix, in antiquity, a famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, which is generally looked upon by the moderns as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its kind; they describe it as of the size of an eagle; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> finely crested with a beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> colour, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of its body purple, only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling like stars: they hold, that it lives 500 or 600 years in the wilderness; that when thus advanced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, it builds itself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of sweet wood and aromatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, and fires it with the wasting of its wings, and thus burns itself; and that from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> arises a worm, which in time grows up to be a phoenix. Hence the Phenicians gave the name of phoenix to the palm-tree; because when burnt down to the root it rises again fairer than ever.\n\nIn the sixth book of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNALS\">Annals</a> of Tacitus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 28.\n\nVol. XVI. Part II.\nfrom their property of making themselves holes in the earth, sand, wood, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and living in them. The means of their getting there, however, are as yet entirely unknown. All that we can know with certainty is, that they must have penetrated these substances when very small; because the entrance of the hole in which the pholas lodges is always much less than the inner part of it, and indeed than the shell of the pholas itself. Hence some have supposed that they were hatched in holes accidentally formed in stones, and that they naturally grew of such a shape as was necessary to fill the cavity.\n\nThe holes in which the pholas lodge are usually twice as deep, at least, as the shells themselves are long; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the holes is that of a truncated cone, excepting that they are terminated at the bottom by a rounded cavity, and their position is usually somewhat oblique to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>. The openings of these holes are what betray the pholas being in the stone; but they are always very small in proportion to the size of the fish. There seems to be no progressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of any animal in nature so slow as that of the pholas; it is immersed in the hole, and has no movement except a small one towards the centre of the earth; and this is only proportioned to the growth of the animal. Its work is very difficult in its motion; but it has great time to perform it in, as it only moves downward, sinking itself deeper in the stone as it increases itself in bulk. That part by means of which it performs this, is a fleshy substance placed near the lower extremity of the shell; it is of the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOZENGE\">lozenge</a>, and is considerably large in proportion to the size of the animal; and though it be of a soft substance, it is not to be wondered at that in so long a time it is able, by constant work, to burrow into a hard stone. The manner of their performing this may be seen by taking one of them out of the stone, and placing it upon some soft clay; for they will immediately get to work in bending and extending that part allotted to dig for them, and in a few hours they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> themselves in the mud in as large a hole as they had taken many years to make in the stone. They find little resistance in so soft a substance; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of their hiding themselves evidently makes them hasten their work. The animal is lodged in the lower half of the hole in the stone, and the upper half is filled up by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> of a fleshy substance and conic figure, truncated at the end: this they usually extend to the orifice of the hole, and place on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the surface of the stone; but they seldom extend it any farther than this. The pipe, though it appears single, is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> composed of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, or at least it is composed of two parts separated by a membrane. The use of this pipe or proboscis is the same with that of the proboscis of other shell-fish, to take in sea-water into their bodies, and afterwards to throw it out again. In the middle of their bodies they have a small green vessel, the use of which has not yet been discovered. This, when plunged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>-of-wine, becomes of a purple colour: but its colour on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> does not become purple in the sun like that of the murex.\n\nThe pholas is remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> quality, which was noticed by Pliny, who observes that it shines in the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who eats it; and if it touch his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> or clothes, it makes them luminous. He also says that the light depends upon its moisture. The light of this fish has furnished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for various observations and experiments to M. Reaumur and the Bolognian academicians, especially Beccarius, who took so much pains with the subject of phosphorescent light.\n\nM. Reaumur observes, that whereas other fishes give light when they tend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, this is more luminous in proportion to its being fresh; that when they are dried, their light will revive if they be moistened either with fresh or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water, but that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a> immediately extinguishes it. He endeavoured to make this light permanent, but none of his schemes succeeded.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Bolognian academicians was engaged to this subject by M. F. Marfilius in 1724, who brought a number of these fishes, and the stones in which they were inclosed, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, on purpose for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.\n\nBeccarius observed, that though this fish ceased to shine when it became putrid, yet that in its most putrid state it would shine, and make the water in which it was immersed luminous when it was agitated. Galeatus and Montius found that wine or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> extinguished this light; that in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> some days, but in rectified spirit of wine or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> hardly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>.\n\nIn order to observe in what manner this light was affected by different degrees of heat, they made use of a Reaumur's thermometer, and found that water rendered luminous by these fishes increased in light till the heat arrived to $45^\\circ$, but that it then became suddenly extinct, and could not be revived again.\n\nIn the experiments of Beccarius, a solution of sea-salt increased the light of the luminous water; a solution of nitre did not increase it quite so much. Sal ammoniac diminished it a little, oil of tartar per deliquium nearly extinguished it, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> entirely. This water, poured upon fresh calcined gypsum, rock-crystal, ceruse, or sugar, became more luminous. He also tried the effects of it when poured upon various other substances, but there was nothing very remarkable in them. Afterwards, using luminous milk, he found that oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a> extinguished the light, but that of tartar increased it.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> had the curiosity to try how differently coloured substances were affected by this kind of light; and having, for this purpose, dipped several ribbons in it, the white came out the brightest, next to this was the yellow, and then the green; the other colours could hardly be perceived. It was not, however, any particular colour, but only light, that was perceived in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. He then dipped boards painted with the different colours, and also glass tubes filled with substances of different colours, in water rendered luminous by the fishes. In both these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> was hardly visible, the yellow was the brightest, and the violet the dullest. But on the boards, the blue was nearly equal to the yellow, and the green more languid; whereas in the glasses, the blue was inferior to the green.\n\nOf all the liquors to which he put the pholas, milk was rendered the most luminous. A single pholas made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> ounces of milk so luminous, that the faces of persons might be distinguished by it, and it looked as if it were transparent.\n\nAir appeared to be necessary to this light: for when Beccarius put the luminous milk into glass tubes, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> would make it shine unless bubbles of air were mixed.\nPholeys, ed with it. Also Montius and Galeatus found, that, in an exhausted receiver, the pholas lost its light, but the water was sometimes made more luminous: which they ascribed to the rising of bubbles of air through it.\n\nBeccarius, as well as Reaumur, had many schemes to render the light of these pholades permanent. For this purpose he kneaded the juice into a kind of paste with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a>, and found that it would give light when it was immersed in warm water; but it answered best to preserve the fish in honey. In any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of preservation, the property of becoming luminous would not continue longer than six months, but in honey it had lasted above a year; and then it would, when plunged in warm water, give as much light as ever it had done.

Some authors tell us, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Pholey, from whence they derive their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, is divided from that of Jaloff by a lake called in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the Mundingoes Cayor; and that it stretches from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> to west about 180 miles; but that, though it extends a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> south, its limits in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> are not exactly ascertained.\n\nMr Moore, however, gives a very different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, and says, that the Pholeys live in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLANS\">clans</a>, build <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and are in every kingdom and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> each side of the river; yet are not subject to any of the kings of the country, though they live in their territories; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are used ill in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> up their towns, and remove to another. They have chiefs of their own, who rule with such moderation, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> seems rather an act of the people than of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.

They are rather of a low stature, but have a genteel and easy shape, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> peculiarly delicate and agreeable.\n\nThough they are strangers in the country, they are the greatest planters in it. They are extremely industrious and frugal, and raise much more corn and cotton than they consume, which they sell at reasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a>; and are so remarkable for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>, that the natives esteem it a blessing to have a Pholey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> in their neighbourhood; and their behaviour has gained them such reputation, that it is esteemed infamous for any one to treat them in an inhospitable manner. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> extends to all, but they are doubly kind to people of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; and if they know of any one of their body being made a slave, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> readily redeem him. As they have plenty of food, they never suffer any of their own people to want; but support the old, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>, and the lame, equally with the others.\n\nThese people are seldom angry; and Mr Moore observes that he never heard them abuse each other; yet this mildness is far from proceeding from want of courage, they being as brave as any people of Africa, and very expert in the use of their arms, which are javelins, cutlasses, bows and arrows, and upon occasion guns. They usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> near some Mundingoe town, there being scarce any of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> up the river that has not a Pholey town near it. Most of them speak Arabic, which is taught in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>; and they are able to read the Koran in that language, though they have a vulgar tongue called Pholey. They are strict Mahometans, and scarce any of them will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a>, or anything stronger than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\n\nThey are so skilful in the management of cattle, that the Mundingoes leave theirs to their care. The whole herd belonging to a town feed all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in the savannahs, and after the crop is off, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>-grounds. They have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> without each town for their cattle, surrounded by a circular hedge, and within this enclosure they raise a stage about eight feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and eight or ten feet wide, covered with a thatched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>; all the sides are open, and they ascend to it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>. Round this stage they fix a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of stakes, and when the cattle are brought up at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> is tied to a separate stake with a strong rope made of the bark of trees. The cows are then milked, and four or five men stay upon the stage all night with their arms to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> them from the lions, tygers, and other wild beasts. Their huts are built in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> manner, they being round structures, placed in rows at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from each other to avoid fire, and each of them has a thatched roof somewhat resembling a high-crowned hat.\n\nThey are also great huntsmen, and not only kill lions, tygers, and other wild beasts, but frequently go 20 or 30 in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> to hunt elephants; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> they sell, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>-dry and eat, keeping it for several months together. As the elephants here generally go in droves of 100 or 200, they do great mischief by pulling up the trees by the roots, and trampling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the corn; to prevent which, when the natives have any suspicion of their coming, they make fires round their corn to keep them out.\n\nThey are almost the only people who make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and sell cattle at some distance up the river.

Bochart is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that this tract was called Phrygia from the Greek verb \u03c6\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \"to burn or parch;\" which, according to him, is a translation of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> name, derived from a verb of the same signification.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> less various are the opinions of authors as to the exact boundaries of this country; an uncertainty which gave rise to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a>, viz. that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHRYGIANS\">Phrygians</a> and Myrians had distinct boundaries; but that it was scarce possible to ascertain them. The same writer adds, that the Trojans, Myrians, and Lydians, are, by the poets, all blended under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> name of Phrygians, which Claudian extends to the Pifidians, Bithynians, and Ionians. Phrygia Proper, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, whom we choose to follow, was bounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by Pontus and Bithynia; on the west by Myria, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TROAS\">Troas</a>, the Aegean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>, Lydia, M\u00e6onia, and Caria; on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCIA\">Lycia</a>; on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> by Pamphylia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a>. It lies between the 37th and 41st degrees of north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, extending in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from 56 to 62 degrees. The inhabitants of this country, mentioned by Ptolemy, are the Lycaones and Anthemieni, towards Lycia; and Moccadels or Moccadine, the Cyddefes or Cydides towards Bithynia; and between these the Petimi or Speltini, the Moxiani, Phylacenes, and Hierapolites. To these we may add the Berecynites mentioned by Strabo.\n\nPhrygia is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> divided into the Greater and Lesser Phrygia, called also Troas. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> did not take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> till Troas was subdued by the Phrygians; and hence it is more considered by some Roman writers as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Phrygia, than Bithynia, Cappadocia,\nPhrygia, or any other of the adjacent provinces. In after ages, the Greater Phrygia was divided into two districts or governments; one called Phrygia Pacatiana, from Pacatianus, who, under Constantine, bore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> office of the praefectus praetorio of the East; the other Phrygia Salutaris, from some miraculous cures supposed to have been performed there by the archangel Michael.\n\nThis country, and indeed all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, as lying in the fifth and sixth northern climates, was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times greatly celebrated for its fertility. It abounded in all sorts of grain; being, for the most part, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> country covered with a deep rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and plentifully watered by small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. It was in some parts productive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">bitumen</a> and other combustible substances. It was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> stocked with cattle, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> plains and pasture grounds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was anciently deemed most pure and wholesome, though it is now in some parts thought extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a>, great part of the country lying uncultivated.\n\nIn Phrygia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> were anciently several cities of great celebrity; such as Apamea, Laodicea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERAPOLIS\">Hierapolis</a>, Gordium, &c.\u2014There were also some famous rivers; such as Marysas, Maeander, &c. The Maeander is now called Madre or Mindre, and was much celebrated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> for its windings and turnings; from whence all such windings and turnings have been denominated meanders.\n\nThe Phrygians accounted themselves the most ancient people in the world. Their origin, however, is extremely dark and uncertain. Josephus and St Jerome say, they were descended from Togarmah, one of Gomer's sons; and that they were known to the Hebrews under the name of Tigranimanes. The Heathen authors derive them from the Brygians, a people of Macedonia. But this is but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> conjecture; and it is a conjecture totally unsupported, except by the similarity of names. Bochart thinks that the Phrygians were the offspring of Gomer the eldest son of Japhet; the word Phrygia being the Greek translation of his name. Josephus makes Gomer the father of the Galatians; but he, by the Galatians, must necessarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the Phrygians inhabiting that part of Phrygia which the Galatians had made themselves masters of; the descendants of Gomer being placed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a> northward of Judaea, near Togarmah (which Bochart takes to be Cappadocia), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the Gauls passed over into Asia. We are willing to let Gomer enjoy the fine country which Bochart is pleased to give him, and allow him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being the progenitor of the Phrygians, since we know no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> on whom it can be conferred with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>.\n\nThe ancient Phrygians are described as superstitious, voluptuous, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a>, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> or foresight, and of such a servile temper, that nothing but stripes and ill usage could make them comply with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>; which gave rise to several trite and well-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVERBS\">proverbs</a> (A). They are said to have been the first inventors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a> by the fingering, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a>, and feeding of birds. Their music, commonly called the Phrygian mood, is alleged by some as an argument of their effeminacy.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was certainly monarchical; for all Phrygia was, during the reigns of some kings, subject to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. Ninnacus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDAS\">Midas</a>, Manis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GORDIUS\">Gordius</a>, and his descendants, were undoubtedly sovereigns of all Phrygia. But some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> before the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, we find this country divided into several petty kingdoms, and read of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> princes reigning at the same time. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOLLODORUS\">Apollodorus</a> mentions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Phrygia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with Ilus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>. Cedrenus and others speak of one Teuthrans, king of a small country in Phrygia, whose territories were ravaged by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AJAX\">Ajax</a>, himself slain in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> seat laid in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, and his daughter, by name Tecmessa, carried away <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVE\">captive</a> by the conqueror. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> makes mention of Phoreys and Arcanius, both princes and leaders of the Phrygian auxiliaries that came to the relief of Troy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TANTALUS\">Tantalus</a> was king of Sipylus only, and its district; a prince no less famous for his great wealth, than infamous for his covetousness and other detestable vices. That Phrygia was subdued either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINUS\">Ninus</a>, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>, as we read in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIDAS\">Suidas</a>, is not sufficiently warranted. Most authors that speak of Gordius tell us, that the Phrygians having sent to consult an oracle in order to know how they might put an end to the intestine broils which rent their country into many factions and parties, received for answer, that the most effectual means to deliver themselves and their country from the calamities they groaned under, was to commit the government to a king. This advice they followed accordingly, and placed Gordius on the throne.\n\nApamea was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> emporium of all Asia Minor.\u2014Thither resorted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and traders from all parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. Besides, we know from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNCELLUS\">Syncellus</a>, that the Phrygians were for some time masters of the sea; and none but trading nations ever prevailed on that element. The country produced many choice and useful commodities, which afforded considerable exports. They had a safe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, and whatever may incline us to think that they carried on a considerable trade. But as most of the Phrygian records are lost, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not dwell on conjectures so difficult to be ascertained.\n\nWe have no set form of their laws; and as to their learning, since we are told that for some time they enjoyed the sovereignty of the sea, we may at least allow them a competent skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>; and add to these, from what we have said above, a more than ordinary knowledge of music.\n\nSome have been of opinion that the Phrygian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> bore a great resemblance to the Greek; but\n\n(A) \"Phryges fero sapiunt, Phryx verberatus melior, Phryx non minus quam Syntharus, &c.:\u201d which proverbs intimate their servile temper; and show that they were more fit to bewail misfortunes in an unmanly manner, than to prevent them by proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. Their music, too, was suited to their effeminate temper. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORIC\">Doric</a> mood was a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> music; the Lydian a doleful and lamentable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; but the Phrygian chiefly calculated to effeminate and enervate the mind. But this character is contradicted by others.\nthe contrary is manifest from the few Phrygian words which have been transmitted to us, and carefully collected by Bochart and Rudbeckius. To these we may add the authority of Strabo, who, after attempting to derive the name of a Phrygian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> from the Greek, concludes, that it is a difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to discover any similitude between the barbarous words of the Phrygian language and the Greek. The Phrygian tongue, after the experiment made by Ptolemy king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, was looked upon by the Egyptians as the most ancient language of the world. But other nations, particularly the Scythians, refused to submit to their opinion, as founded on an argument of no real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. \"As the two children (say they) had never heard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> creature, the word *b\u0113k*, or *bektor*, the first they uttered, was only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the goats that had suckled them, and happened to be a Phrygian word signifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> (b).\"\n\nWe have already said, that the Phrygians were superstitious; their idols were consequently very numerous. The chief of these was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYBELE\">Cybele</a>, who went by a variety of names. (See CYBELE.) They also worshipped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a> under the name of Sabazios; and his priests they called Saboi.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of their kings is dark and uncertain, and the dates of their several reigns and actions cannot now be fixed; we shall refer such of our readers, therefore, as wish to know what is certain respecting them, to the Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History, already quoted more than once in the present article.

We have certainly discovered many of the ancient systems to be merely creatures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. Perhaps, however, in some instances, we have decided too rapidly, and rejected real knowledge, which we would have found it tedious and troublesome to acquire.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the signification of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> was adopted universally by those naturalists who admitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of signatures (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNATURE\">SIGNATURE</a>); and physiognomy came thus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, the knowledge of the internal properties of any corporeal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearances. Joannes Baptista Porta, for instance, who was a physiognomist and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, wrote a treatise on the physiognomy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> (physiognomica), in which he employs physiognomy as the generic term. There is a treatise likewise De Physiognomia Animalium, written we believe by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. In the Magia Physiognomica of Galpar Schottus, physiognomia humana is made a subdivision of the science.\n\nBoyle too adopts the extensive signification mentioned, which indeed seems to have been at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the usual acceptation of the word (A). At present physiognomy seems to mean no more than \"a knowledge of the moral character and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of intellectual powers of human beings, from their external appearance and manners.\" In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Transactions for the years 1769 and 1770 there appears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> controversial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> on the subject of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of physiognomy between M. Pernety and M. Le Cat, two modern authors of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>. Pernety contends that all knowledge whatever is physiognomy; Le Cat confines the subject to the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. Neither seems to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Soon after the celebrated book of Lavater appeared. He indeed defines physiognomy to be, \"the art of discovering the interior of man by means of his exterior;\" but in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of his work he evidently favours the extended signification of Pernety. This work gave occasion to M. Formey's attack upon the science itself in the same Berlin Transactions for 1775. Formey strenuously controverts the extent assigned by Lavater to his favorite science.\n\nBefore the era of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> the Greeks had little or Pythagoras no science, and of course could not be scientifical physiognomists. Physiognomy, however, was much cultivated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; and from these countries the science spread to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.\n\n(A) They'll find i' the physiognomies O' th' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> all men's destinies. HUDIBRAS.\npage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a> probably introduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of this science; as he did those of many others, generally deemed more important, into Greece.\n\nIn the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> it appears even to have been adopted as a profession. Of this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-known anecdote of the decision of Zopyrus, on the real character of Socrates himself, judging from his countenance, is sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> mentions the subject; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> it is formally treated of in a book allotted to the purpose.\n\nIt may be worth while to give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> outline of Aristotle's sentiments on the subject.\n\nPhysiognomy, he in substance observes, had been treated of in three ways: Some philosophers classified animals into genera, and ascribed to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> a certain mental disposition corresponding to their corporeal appearance. Others made a farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of dividing the genera into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Among men, for instance, they distinguished the Thracians, the Scythians, the Egyptians, and whatever nations were strikingly different in manners and habits, to whom accordingly they assigned the distinctive physiognomical characteristics. A third set of physiognomists judged of the actions and manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, and presumed that certain manners proceeded from certain dispositions. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of treating the subject adopted by Aristotle himself was this: A peculiar form of body is invariably accompanied by a peculiar disposition of mind; a human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> is never found in the corporeal form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>. The mind and body reciprocally affect each other: thus in intoxication and mania the mind exhibits the affections of the body; and in fear, joy, &c., the body displays the affections of the mind.\n\nFrom such facts he argues, that when in man a particular bodily character appears, which by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> has been found uniformly accompanied by a certain mental disposition, with which therefore it must have been necessarily connected; we are intitled in all such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to infer the disposition from the appearance. Our observations, he conceives, may be drawn from other animals as well as from men: for as a lion possesses one bodily form and mental character, a hare another, the corporeal characteristics of the lion, such as strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> extremities, discernible in a human creature, denote the strength and courage of that noble animal; while the slender extremities, feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and other features of the hare, visible in a man, betray the mental character of that pusillanimous creature.\n\nUpon this principle Aristotle treats of the corporeal features of man, and the correspondent dispositions, so far as observed: he illustrates them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, and in some instances attempts to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for them by physiological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>.\n\nAt the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> in which Aristotle wrote, his theory, plausible certainly, and even probable, displays his usual penetration and a considerable degree of knowledge. He distinctly notices individual physiognomy, national physiognomy, and comparative physiognomy. The state of knowledge in his time did not admit of a complete elucidation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> principles; on that account his enumeration of particular observations and precepts is by no means so well founded or so accurate as his method of study. Even his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, concise and energetic, was inimical to the subject; which, to be made clearly comprehensible, must require frequent paraphrases. Aristotle's performance, however, such as it is, has been taken as the groundwork and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of every physiognomical treatise that has since appeared.\n\nThe imitators of this great man in the 16th and 17th centuries have even copied his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and manner, which areentious, indiscriminate, and obscure. His comparative physiognomy of men with beasts has been frequently though not universally adopted. Besides his treatise expressly on the subject, many incidental observations on physiognomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found interposed through his other works, particularly in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of animals.\n\nNext after Aristotle, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> and successor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a> would deserve to be particularly mentioned as an ethicist as a writer on the subject in question. His ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, a singular and entertaining performance, composed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 99, form a distinct treatise on a branch of most important branch of physiognomy, the physiognomy of manners: but the translations and imitations of Laumy, Bruyere, are so excellent, that by referring to them we do greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> than would otherwise be in our power, both to Theophrastus and to our readers. We cannot, however, omit observing, that the accuracy of observation and liveliness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in the work of Theophrastus will preserve it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> in classical rank, while the science of man and the prominent characteristics of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> continue to be objects of attention.\n\nPolemon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, Adamantius the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHIST\">sophist</a>, and several others, wrote on the subject about the same period. Lately there was published a collection of all the authors on Greek authors on physiognomy: the book is entitled Physiognomiae veteris scriptores Graeci, Gr. et Lat. Francisci Altenb. 1782, 8vo. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these authors, it appears that the science was much cultivated in Greece; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> seem soon to have connected with it something of the marvellous. This we have from some cause to suspect from the story told by Apion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, the marvellous thing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>: Imaginem adeo similitudinis indicietem pinxit, ut (incredibile dictu) Apion Grammaticus Scriptum reliquerit quemdam ex facie hominum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> divinationem (quos melapof, copos vocant) ex illis dixisse aut futurae mortis annori, aut pretenderet*. The novices of the Pythagorean school were subjected to the physiognomic observation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a>, and it is probable the first physiognomists by lib. 35, profession among the Greeks were of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. They, \u00a7 35, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">par</a>., too, to whom, from the nature of their doctrines and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, mystery was familiar, were the first, it is likely, who exposed the science of physiognomy in Greece to disgrace, by blending with it the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>.\n\nFrom the period of which we have been treating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the Roman republic, nothing worthy of notice occurs in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> history of physiognomy. About the last mentioned era, however, and from thence to the decline of the empire under the later emperors, the science appears to have been cultivated as an important branch of erudition, and assumed as a profession by persons who had acquired a superior knowledge in it.\n\nIn the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> and Galen, many physiognomical observations occur. Cicero appears to have been peculiarly attached to the science. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>...\ntion against Piso, and in that in favour of Rofcius, the reader will at the same time perceive in what manner the orator employs phylognomy to his purposes, and find a curious instance of the ancient manner of oratorical abuse.\n\nMany phylognomic remarks are to be found likewise in the writings of Sallust, Suetonius, Seneca, Pliny, Aulus Gellius, Petronius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, and others.\n\nThat in the Roman empire the science was practised as a profession, ample evidence appears in the writings of several of the authors just mentioned. Suetonius, for instance, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of Titus, mentions that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARCISSUS\">Narcissus</a> employed a physiognomist to examine the features of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITANNICUS\">Britannicus</a>, who predicted that Britannicus would not succeed, but that the empire would devolve on Titus.\n\nThe science of phylognomy shared the same fate with all others, when the Roman empire was overthrown by the northern barbarians. About the beginning of the 16th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> it began again to be noticed.\u2014From that time till the close of the 17th, it was one of the most fashionable studies. Within that space have appeared almost all the approved modern authors on the subject (B).\n\nIt has been unfortunate for phylognomy, that by many of these writers it was held to be connected with doctrines of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of the present day would be ashamed. With these doctrines it had almost sunk into oblivion.\n\nIn every period of the history of literature there may be marked a prevalence of particular studies. In the early period, for instance, of Grecian literature, mythological morality claimed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> attention of the philosophers. In the more advanced state of learning in Greece and in Rome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, history, and oratory, held the pre-eminence. Under the latter emperors, and for some time afterwards, the history of theological controversies occupied the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of works of the learned. Next succeeded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, and metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>. These gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to alchemy, magic, judicial astrology, the doctrine of signatures and sympathies, the mystic, theosophic, and Rosicrucian theology, with phylognomy. Such were the pursuits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with the science which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of our present inquiry. It is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of surprise, that, so associated, it should have fallen into contempt. It is not unusual for mankind hastily to reject valuable opinions, when accidentally or artificially connected with others which are absurd and untenable. Of the truth of this remark, the history of theology, and the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of theological opinions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, furnish a pregnant example.\n\nTo phylognomy, and the exploded sciences last mentioned, succeeded clastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOLOGY\">philology</a>; which gave place to modern poetry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy; to which recently have been added the studies of rational theology, chro-\n\n(B) They are, Bartholem. Cocles, Baptista Porta, Honoratus Nuquetius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOBUS\">Jacobus</a> de Indagine, Alstedius, Michael Schottus, Gaetar Schottus, Cardan, Talhierus, Fludd, Behmen, Barclay, Claromontius, Conringius, the commentaries of Augustin Niphus, and Camillus Balbus on the Physiognomica of Aristotle,\u2014Spontanus, Andreas Henricus, Joannes Digandar, Rud. Goelienius, Alex. Achillimus, Joh. Praetorius, Jo. Belot, Guliel. Gratatalorus, &c. They are noticed in the Polyhistor of Morhoff, vol. i. lib. i. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 15. \u00a7 4. and vol. ii. lib. iii. cap. 1. \u00a7 4.\nextend its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>; and certainly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we may judge, the book, though many faults may be detected in it, is the most important of any that has appeared on the subject since the days of Aristotle. Lavater professes not to give a complete synthetical treatise on physiognomy, but, aware that the science is yet in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, he exhibits fragments only, illustrative of its different parts. His performance is no doubt delusory and unconnected. It contains, however, many particulars much superior to anything that had ever before appeared on the subject.\n\nWith the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOLASTIC\">scholastic</a> and systematic method adopted by the physiognomists of the last and preceding centuries, Lavater has rejected their manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, which was dry, concise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a>, and general: His remarks, on the contrary, are, for the most part, precise and particular, frequently founded on distinctions extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a>. He has omitted entirely (as was to be expected from a writer of the present day) the astrological reveries, and such like, which deform the writings of former physiognomists; and he has with much propriety deduced his physiognomical observations but seldom from anatomical or physiological reasoning. Such reasoning may perhaps at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> period become important; but at present our knowledge of facts, although extensive, is not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, as to become the stable foundation of particular deductions. Lavater has illustrated his remarks by engravings; a method first adopted by Baptista Porta.\u2014Lavater's engravings are very numerous, often expressive, and tolerably executed.\n\nThe opinions of this celebrated physiognomist are evidently the result of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> observation. He appears indeed to have made the science his peculiar study, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> pursuit of his life. His performance exhibits an extended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of the subject, by a particular attention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICIAL\">official</a> physiognomy, and the effect of profiles and contours. His style in general is forcible and lively, although somewhat declamatory and digressive. His expressions are frequently precise, and strikingly characteristic; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> which pervade the whole performance render it highly interesting.\n\nThe defects of the work, however, detract much from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> which Lavater's opinions might otherwise challenge. His imagination has frequently so far outstript his judgement, that an ordinary reader would often be apt to reject the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> as the extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERIE\">reverie</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> theorist. He has clothed his favourite science in that affected mysterious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of importance, which was so usual with his predecessors, and describes the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> world to be objects of the universal dominion of physiognomy*. He whimsically conceives it necessary for a physiognomist to be a well-shaped handsome man\u2020. He employs a language which is often much too peremptory and decisive, disproportionate to the real subsistence of his remarks, or to the occasion of making them. The remarks themselves are frequently opposite in appearance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> observation, and yet unsupported by any illustrations of his.\n\nLavater certainly errs in placing too great a reliance on single features, as the foundation of decision on character. His opinions on the physiognomy of the ears, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, and feet of the human species, on handwriting, on the physiognomy of birds, insects, reptiles, and fishes, are obviously premature, as hitherto no sufficient number of accurate observations have been made, in regard to either of these particulars, to authorise any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>. He has erred in the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, when treating of the important topic of national physiognomy, where he has by no means prosecuted the subject so far as facts might have warranted. We must farther take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to object to the frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of the author's own physiognomy throughout the course of his work. His singular remarks on his own face do not serve to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> the reader in favour of his judgement, however much his character may justify the truth of them. We must regret likewise, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of the science, that the author's singularly fanciful theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARITIONS\">apparitions</a> should so nearly resemble a revival of the antiquated opinions of the sympathists.\n\nTo these blemishes, which we have reluctantly enumerated, perhaps may be added that high impassioned tone of enthusiasm in favour of his science everywhere displayed throughout the work of this author, which is certainly very opposite to the cool patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> befitting philosophy. To that enthusiasm, however, it is probable that in this instance (as is, indeed, no unfrequent effect of enthusiasm) we are indebted for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCELLENCY\">excellency</a> which the author has attained in his pursuit; and it poetifies the salutary tendency of putting us on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against a too implicit acquiescence in his physiological decisions.\n\nIn the Berlin Transactions for 1775, there appears a formal attack upon Lavater's work by M. Formey, was attacked. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> we have already mentioned. After disputing on the propriety of the extensive signification applied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> Lavater and Permetty to the term physiognomy, M. Formey adopts nearly the same definition which we conceive to be the most proper, and which we have put down as such near the beginning of this article. He allows that the mental character is intimately connected with, and visibly influenced by, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of the body; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> argument against physiognomy is, that the human frame is liable to innumerable accidents, by which it may be changed in its external appearance, without any correspondent change of the disposition; so that it surpasses the extent of the skill of mortals to distinguish the modifications of feature that are natural, from those which may be accidental. Although, therefore, the science of physiognomy may be founded in truth, he infers that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a> only can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> it.\n\nM. Formey further contends, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, diet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and sudden emotions, nay even the temperaments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of human features; so that the influence of mental character on these features may be so involved with, or hidden by, accidental circumstances, that the study of physiognomy must ever be attended by hopeless uncertainty. These objections are worthy of notice, but they are by no means conclusive.\n\nWe shall give a specimen of M. Lavater's manner of treating the subject on the opposite side of the question: A specimen, not in Lavater's precise words, but conveying more shortly an idea at once of his sentiments, and of his manner of expressing them.\n\nNo study, says he, excepting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, more justly deserves to be termed a science than physiognomy. It is a department of physics, including theology and edified belles lettres, and in the same manner with these sciences ence.\nmay be reduced to rule. It may acquire a fixed and appropriate character: It may be communicated and taught.\n\nTruth or knowledge, explained by fixed principles, becomes science. Words, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, rules, definitions, are the medium of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>. The question, then, with respect to phsyognomy, will thus be fairly stated. Can the striking and marked differences which are visible between one human face, one human form, and another, be explained, not by obscure and confused conceptions, but by certain characters, signs, and expressions? Are these signs capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the vigour or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMBECILITY\">imbecility</a>, the sickness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, of the body; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, the folly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, the meanness, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, or the vice, of the mind?\n\nIt is only to a certain extent that even the experimental philosopher can pursue his researches. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and vigorous mind, employed in such studies, will often form conceptions which he shall be incapable of expressing in words, so as to communicate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> to the feeblest mind, which was itself unable to make the discovery: But the lofty, the exalted mind, which soars beyond all written rule, which possesses feelings and energies reducible to no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, must be pronounced unscientific.\n\nIt will be admitted, then, that to a certain degree phsyognomical truth may as a science be defined and communicated. Of the truth of the science there cannot exist a doubt. Every countenance, every form, every created existence, is individually different, as well as different, in respect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, and kind. No one being in nature is precisely similar to another. This proposition, in so far as regards man, is the foundation-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of phsyognomy. There may exist an intimate analogy, a striking similarity, between two men, who yet being brought together, and accurately compared, will appear to be remarkably different. No two minds perfectly resemble each other. Now, is it possible to doubt that there must be a certain native analogy between the external varieties of countenance and form and the internal varieties of the mind? By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> the muscles are rendered protuberant: Are not, then, the angry mind, and the protuberant muscles, as cause and effect? The man of acute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> has frequently a quick and lively eye. Is it possible to resist the conclusion, that between such a mind and such a countenance there is a determinate relation?\n\nEvery thing in nature is estimated by its phsyognomy; that is, its external appearance. The trader judges by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, the fineness, the exterior, the phsyognomy of every article of traffic; and he at once decides that the buyer \"has an honest look,\" or \"a pleasing or forbidding countenance.\"\n\nThat knowledge and science are detrimental to man, that a state of rudeness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> are preferable and productive of more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, are tenets now deservedly exploded. They do not merit serious opposition. The extension and increase of knowledge, then, is an object of importance to man: And what object can be so important as the knowledge of man himself? If knowledge can influence his happiness, the knowledge of himself must influence it the most. This useful knowledge is the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the science of phsyognomy. To conceive a just idea of the advantages of phsyognomy, let us for a moment suppose that all phsyognomical knowledge were totally forgotten among men; what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, what uncertainty, what numberless mistakes, would be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>? Men destined to live in society must hold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> intercourse. The knowledge of man imparts to this intercourse its spirit, its pleasures, its advantages.\n\nPhsyognomy is a source of pure and exalted mental gratification. It affords a new view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of great men; it displays a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> in his works; it reveals internal motives, which without it would only have been discovered in the world to come. The phsyognomist distinguishes accurately the permanent from the habitual, the habitual from the accidental, in character. Difficulties, no doubt, attend the study of this science. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> shades, scarcely discernible to the unexperienced eye, denote often total opposition of character. A small inflexion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>, lengthening or sharpening, even though but of a hair's-breadth, may alter in an astonishing degree the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of countenance and character. How difficult then, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> indeed, must this variety of the same countenance render precision? The feet of character is often so hidden, so masked, that it can only be detected in certain, perhaps uncommon, positions of countenance. These positions may be so quickly changed, the signs may so instantaneously disappear, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the mind of the observer may be so slight, or these distinguishing traits themselves so difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>, that it shall be impossible to paint them or describe them in language. Innumerable great and small accidents, whether physical or moral, various incidents and passions, the diversity of dress, of position, of light or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, tend to display the countenance often in so disadvantageous a point of view, that the phsyognomist is betrayed into an erroneous judgement of the true qualities of the countenance and character. Such causes often occasion him to overlook the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> traits of character, and to form a decision on what is purely accidental.\u2014How surprisingly, for instance, may the smallpox disfigure the countenance, and destroy or confound, or render imperceptible, traits otherwise the most decisive?\n\nWe shall, then, continues Lavater, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to the opponent of phsyognomy all he can ask; and yet we do not deny the existence of hopes that many of the difficulties shall be visited, resolved which at first appeared inexplicable.\n\nHe then proceeds to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> illustration of his subject under a great variety of titles, in which he treats of Lavater's human nature in general, and of each particular feature separately.\n\nTo enumerate the different divisions of his book would not be more satisfactory to our readers than the perusal of the contents of the book itself; and an attempt to epitomize even the essential substance of the vast multiplicity of matter contained in his essays, (which are yet only fragments, and to which indeed he himself does not pretend to give any higher appellation), would extend this article to a disproportionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>. Such an abridgement, after all, would convey no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> on a subject which merits all the time and study that an attentive perusal of Lavater's works at large would require.\n\nFrom the historical deduction of the literary progress of phsyognomy which we have thus attempted to lay before our readers, it appears, that although the science which this has fallen into disrepute, there can scarcely be mentioned as having fallen.\ned a period in which any cultivation of science took place when physiognomy was not likewise the study, nay sometimes even the profession, of men of the most eminent abilities and the greatest learning.\n\nThe reasons why at present so little attention is paid to the subject probably are,\n\n1st, That it has been treated in conjunction with subjects now with propriety exploded: And,\n\n2dly, That it has been injured by the injudicious assertions and arguments of those who have undertaken its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>.\n\nSometimes, however, the wise and the learned may err. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of anything must not be rejected for no better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> than that it is capable of abuse. Perhaps the era is not distant when physiognomy shall be reinstated in the rank which she merits among the valuable branches of human knowledge, and be studied with that degree of attention and perseverance which a subject deserves so essentially connected with the science of man.\n\nThat there is an intimate relation between the dispositions of the mind and the features of the countenance is a fact which cannot be questioned. He who is sunk under a load of grief for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of an affectionate wife or a dutiful child, has very different cast of features from the man who is happy in the prospect of meeting his mistress. A person <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> with anger has a threatening air in his countenance, which the most heedless observer never mistakes; and if any particular disposition be indulged till it become habitual, there cannot be a doubt but that the corresponding traces will be so fixed in the face as to be discernible by the skilful physiognomist, under every effort made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> them. But when we attempt to decide on a man's intellectual powers by the rules of this science, we are often deceived; and in this respect we have reason to believe that Lavater himself has fallen into the grossest mistakes.\n\nConnected with physiognomy, we may consider the craniometric system of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">Gall</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, which is so called, because, from the exterior form of the cranium, he infers the powers and dispositions of the mind. The brain, he observes, is the material organ of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the mind; and as it increases in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the faculties of animals, he has endeavoured to prove, that the faculties are distinct and independent on each other; that each has its proper material organ, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the organ is in proportion to the strength of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>. This system is attempted to be established by the following reasoning.\n\n\"The internal faculties, (says Dr Bojanus, the author of a view of this system), do not always exist in the same proportion to each other. There are some men who have a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> without having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, who have courage without circumspection, and who possess a metaphysical spirit without being good observers.\n\nBesides, the phenomena of dreaming, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOMNAMBULISM\">somnambulism</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>, &c., prove to us that the internal faculties do not always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> together; that there is often a very great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of one, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> are not sensible.\n\nThus, in old age, and sometimes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, such, for example as madness, several faculties are lost, while others subsist; besides, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> employment of the same faculty sensibly diminishes its energy: If we employ another, we find it has all the force of which it is susceptible; and if we return to the former faculty, it is observed that it has resumed its usual vigour. It is thus that, when fatigued with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> philosophical work, we proceed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to a poetical one, and then resume with the same attention our former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a>.\"\n\n\"All these phenomena prove that the faculties are distinct and independent of each other, and we are inclined to believe that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is the same with their material organs.\"\n\n\"We do not entirely agree with this idea of Dr Gall, and we believe, on the contrary, that the separation of the material organs ought to be considered as the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the internal faculties. It appears, to us at least, that by supposing the faculties themselves as originally separated, we cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> ourselves from falling into materialism, which exists when the mind is no longer considered as unity.\"\n\n\"The expansion of the organs contained in the cranium is in the direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the force of their corresponding faculties.\"\n\n\"This principle, dictated by analogy, rests on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, that throughout all nature the faculties are always found to be proportioned to their relative organs; and the truth of it is proved in a special manner by the particular observations of Dr Gall.\n\n\"It is however to be remarked, that exercise has a great influence on the force of the faculties, and that an organ moderately expanded, but often exercised, can give a faculty superior to that which accompanies a very extensive organ never put in action; as we see that a man of a weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a> acquires, by continued exercise, strength superior to another of a more athletic structure.\"\n\n\"We must here mention an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which seems to result immediately from this principle, and which, however, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>: It is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the brain, in general, is in the direct ratio of the energy of its faculties. Observation has proved to Dr Gall, that we cannot judge of the strength of the faculties but by the development of the separate organs which form distinct eminences in the cranium; and that a cranium perfectly round, of whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> it may be, is never a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of many or of great faculties.\n\n\"We do not recollect to have heard the reason assigned by Dr Gall; but, in our opinion, these brains may be considered as in a state analogous to obesity; and as we do not judge of the muscular force of a man or an animal by the volume of their members, but by the development of the muscles in particular, one would think we ought, in like manner, to judge of the strength of the faculties by the development of the relative organs.\n\n\"In the last place, the 4th principle, the most important for practice in regard to the system of Dr Gall, is:\n\n\"We may judge of these different organs and of their faculties by the exterior form of the cranium.\n\n\"The truth of this principle is founded upon another, viz. that the conformation of the cranium depends on that of the brain; a truth generally acknowledged, and proved by the anterior part of the brain, by the impressions in the anterior part of the cranium, and by other facts.\n\n[There are skulls, it is true, in which an external protuberance","sp":44,"ep":50},{"h":"PHYSIOGNOMY","t":"protuberance of the bone corresponds to an interior one; and this irregularity, which is found sometimes as a dif-\nficult, and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> at an advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, when the cerebral organs do not oppose the same resistance to the\ncranium, renders the practice of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">Gall</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, uncertain.]\n\n\"Guided by these principles, Dr Gall examines the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the skull, compares the crania of animals and those of men analogous and different in faculties. His researches have proved to him, in a manner almost incontestable, not only the above truths, but that the faculties of animals are analogous to those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; that what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> in animals is found also in the latter, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, cunning, circumcision, courage, &c.; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the organs fixes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of animals, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> that of individuals; that the disposition originally given to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> by nature may be called forth by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> and favourable circumstances, and sometimes by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, but that it never can be created in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> where it has not been given by nature (c); that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of the organs takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in a constant manner from the hind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> forwards, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> to the top, in such a manner, that animals in proportion as they approach man in the quantity of their faculties have the superior and anterior part of the brain more expanded; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> place, that in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> animal, man, there are organs in the anterior and superior parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONTAL\">frontal</a> bone, and of the parietals, destined for faculties which belong to them exclusively. It is under the latter point of view that the discoveries of Dr Gall agree perfectly with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the facial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, which seems still further to establish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of them.\"\n\nMost of our readers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> probably be satisfied with the short view which we have now given of this fanciful and visionary system; but such as wish for a fuller exposition of it, may consult the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, vol. xiv., p. 77, from which the above is extracted.

We shall here, however, notice some of its peculiarities. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, it has been observed, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> musical instrument; of this all other instruments are to be considered but as imitations; and it is remarkable with what promptitude, as well as accuracy, the voice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> obeys the impulse of the heart. Even a coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> is hurt by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a>, amounting to what is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMA\">comma</a>; and a limited voice can execute melodies which include 12 notes, or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTAVE\">octave</a> and a fifth. Between these extremes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the glottis does not amount to one-twelfth of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>, which must therefore be divided by the most ordinary finger into more than 1000 parts. All this too, without any seeming effort of thought, is done in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, and repeated with rapidity, without mistaking one of the divisions.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of musical instruments is, to bring them as near as possible to express the sounds produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> voice: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIOLIN\">violin</a>, however, and a few of the simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> instruments, are the only ones found fully to express these momentary gradations of sentiment, and those tender and delicate emotions with which the heart is agitated. For the purpose of removing this defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> instruments, the swell was added to the organ. Similar improvements were also attempted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> other instruments of the same kind, and in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. The harpsichord was flutted like the swell organ, and was opened by means of pedals, when the performer wished to enforce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. But as this was found not to succeed well, other methods were tried, and in particular unisons were added to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, which were brought on, either by means of pedals, or by another set of keys; and in this way the power of the harpsichord was greatly improved. Among all the keyed instruments, the English piano forte seems to merit the preference, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the superior force of tone, adequate sweetness, and great variety of voice, of which, by the ingenuity of British artists, it has now become susceptible. It has been called a national instrument, because it is said to be an English contrivance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the celebrated poet, Mafon. Mr Mafon had seen some attempts that were made by the Germans to make keyed dulcimers, which were in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> susceptible of the forte and piano; but as they were all constructed on one principle, and required a particular touch of the finger, which was of difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, and which spoiled it for harpsichord practice; as they were also deficient in delicacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a>; and as the performer was by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means certain of producing the very strength of sound intended, Mr Mafon removed all those imperfections, by detaching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a> entirely from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>, and giving them only a momentary connection. It is by this improvement that the English piano forte is distinguished from all others. Mr Mafon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> principle may be fully understood by the following description. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> on Plate CCCXVIII. the parts are represented in their state of inaction. The key ABK turns, as usual, on the round edge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> E, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> P, driven into the bar, keeps it in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\nPIA\n\nThe dot F represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the string. ED is the mallet, having a hinge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELLUM\">vellum</a>, by which it is attached to the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the bar E. At the other end is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> D, of wood, covered with some folds of prepared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. The mallet lies in the position represented in the figure, its lower end resting on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSHION\">cushion</a>-bar K, which lies horizontally under the whole row of mallets. The key AR has a pin C, tipped with a bit of the softest cork or buckskin. This reaches to within \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of an inch of the shank of the mallet, but must not touch it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> Ee is about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)d or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the shank. When the end A of the key is pressed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on the stuffing (two or three thicknesses of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>) it raises the mallet, by means of the pin C, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position Ed, within \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of an inch of the wire F; but it cannot be so much pressed down as to make the mallet touch the wire. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the key raises the mallet by means of the pin C, it also lifts off the damper G (a bit of sponge) from the wire. This damper is fixed on the end of a little wooden pin Gg, connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> gH; which has a vellum hinge at H. This motion of the damper is caused by the pin I, which is fixed into the key near to R. These pieces are so adjusted, that the first touch of the key lifts the damper, and, immediately after, the pin C acts on the shank of the mallet. As it acts so near to its centre of motion, it causes the head D to move briskly through a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> Dd. Being made extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a>, and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, it is thus lifted beyond the horizontal position Ed, and it strikes the wire F, which is now at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to vibrate up and down, by the previous removal of the damper G. Having made its stroke, the mallet falls down again, and rests on the soft substance on the pin C. It is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> importance that this mallet be extremely light. Were it heavy, it would have too much force, after rebounding from the wire, that it would rebound from the pin C, and again strike the wire. For it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be recollected, that the key is, at this time, down, and the pin C raised as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as possible, so that there is very little room for this rebound. Lessening the momentum of the mallet by making it very light, making the cushion on the top of the pin C very soft, and great precision in the shape and figure of all the parts, are the only securities against the disagreeable rattling which these rebounds would occasion. In respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> and precision of workmanship, the British instruments are unrivalled, and vast numbers of them have been sent to all parts of the continent.\n\nAs the blow of so light a mallet cannot bring much sound from a wire, it has always been found necessary to have two strings for each note. Another circumstance contributes to enfeeble the sound. The mechanism necessary for producing it makes it almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to give any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to the belly or sound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> of the instrument. There is seldom any more of it than what occupies the space between the tuning pins and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>. This is the more to be regretted, because the baffles are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> covered strings, that they may be of a moderate length. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASS\">bass</a> notes are also of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, which has a considerably lower tone than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> wire of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> and tension. Yet even this substitution for steel in the bass strings is not enough. The highest of them are much too slack, and the lowest ones must be loaded, to compensate for want of length.\n\nThis greatly diminishes the fullness, and still more the Piano Forte, mellowness and distinctness of the tone, and frequently makes the very lowest notes hardly appreciable. This inequality of tone about the middle of the instrument is somewhat diminished by constructing the instrument with two bridges; one for the steel, and the other for the brass wires. But still the bass notes are very much inferior to the treble.","sp":143,"ep":144},{"h":"PIASTUS","t":"a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, was originally a wheelwright and the son of Cosifco, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRACOW\">Cracow</a>. He flourished in the year 830, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the extinction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Popiel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> disputes arose about his successor, and Cracow was afflicted with a severe famine. During this extremity, when the people were dropping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the streets, two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> forms, as the story is told, took up their residence with Piastus, who was celebrated for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>. He had nothing left but a small cask of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> liquor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and this he presented to his new guests, who, charmed with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>, promised him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Poland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of Piastus was equal to his other virtues: he implicitly believed the word of his guests; he piously followed their directions in every particular. He was ordered to distribute the liquor out of his little cask to the multitude: he did so, and found that it was inexhaustible. The people were astonished; all cried out, \"A miracle!\" and the electors determined to choose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in whose favour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> had so visibly declared: Piastus was accordingly taken from his shop, and raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCAL\">ducal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>.\n\nSuch is the relation of the canon of Cracow, which differs in many particulars from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> given by Guagnini, and several other historians. According to them, Piastus had prepared a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLATION\">collation</a>, to entertain some friends who were assembled at the birth of a child. Two pilgrims, Paul and John, afterwards murdered at Rome, came about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to Cracow. They begged charity at the door of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, and were rudely repulsed; upon which they stumbled on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Piastus, and were kindly received. The miracle we have mentioned was wrought by them; and the two pilgrims, and not angels, were the instruments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the hospitable wheelwright. Though we pay but little regard to the marvellous means by which Piastus ascended the ducal throne of Poland, it would be presumptuous entirely to omit a fact attested by all the writers upon this subject: it was proper, therefore, to take notice of it, and we leave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> to the reader's judgement.\n\nBeing now raised to the supreme dignity, he was not intoxicated with his prosperity. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> charity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, and sweetness of disposition, remained: nothing was altered but his power of doing good. He was truly called the father of his people: the injured never returned unredeemed, nor merit unrewarded. Piastus wiped the tear from the eyes of the widow; and was himself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> of the orphan, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and distressed.

His disposition, however, strongly led him to the pursuit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, with an eager curiosity to penetrate the secrets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>; with this view he travelled over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and France, visited the most celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of each, and studied under the most famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> of both countries.

This sort of challenge was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in that age, and, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> was scarcely practised, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of learning less rapidly extended than it is now, was almost the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of superior attainments had to make himself known. Mirandola proposed 999 questions, or as they were called conclusiones, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECTICS\">dialectics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, drawn not only from the stores of the Latin and Greek, but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of the Hebrews and the arcana of the Chald\u00e6ans and Arabians. In addition to the endless topics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, and the ordinary subjects of disputation, into which he entered very profoundly, the conclusiones involved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and obscure philosophy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, Trismegistas, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>; the doctrines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABALA\">Cabala</a>, or mystic interpretation of the sacred writings, according to the Hebrews, taught by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HILARIUS\">Hilarius</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, uses, and learning of natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, which was vindicated from the vulgar reproach of impiety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECROMANCY\">necromancy</a>. Seventy-two new physical and metaphysical dogmata of the author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> were likewise proposed and defended. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, according to the ostentatious practice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> these occasions, were fixed in the most public places in Rome, and the proposer engaged to defray the expenses of any one who should come from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> for the purpose of disputing with him. This challenge did not bring forward any disputants, but exposed Mirandola to much envy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, particularly from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of science at Rome, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the reflection that would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> upon their credit by their declining a competition which they durst not encounter. Unable to injure his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> as a scholar, they made a much more dangerous attack upon the foundations of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; thirteen questions were selected, which were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the terrible suspicion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> and contempt of the ordinances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; a suspicion very readily listened to by the church when directed against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> learning, which the increasing influence of philosophy and letters began to make her watch with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> jealousy. Mirandola repelled this attack by publishing his Apologia, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of the accused Propositions; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he did not effectually clear away the suspicions he had incurred, tended to confirm his enemies in their dread of his learning and powers; and it must be owned that, overlook-\ning the misapplication of talents to such subjects, the Apologia exhibits a command of profound and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> digested learning and keen argument, truly astonishing at the age of twenty-three. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and the difficulties it contained of certain delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, added to some hints of the limits of pontifical control in matters of faith, were so disagreeable to Pope Innocent VIII. that he interdicted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> both of the Apology and the disputed questions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, however, was not Mirandola's only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>: his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, splendid accomplishments, and the graces of his person, for which he is said to have been remarkable, attracted the admiration and carefess of many distinguished Roman ladies, who united the love of letters to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> very common amongst the Italian ladies of that age. The young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> yielded to the force of these allurements, or rather, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his nephew, and biographer, Francisco de Mirandola, eagerly followed the bent of his disposition, naturally inclined to obey the attractions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>.\n\nBut this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of pleasure, however suitable to his condition and inclinations, was of a short continuance. Irritated by the relentless persecutions of his enemies, and obliged perpetually to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> himself against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a> of heresy, the most formidable calamity which in that age any man could have to contend with, he detached himself from vicious pleasures, and regulated his manner of life by rigidly observing the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> imposed by Christianity; for being a firm adherent to the Christian doctrines, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> and the vigilance of his enemies made him the more solicitous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the appearance of disobeying them. Becoming from this time wholly devoted to learning, he soon acquired such celebrity that the most eminent scholars from all parts of Italy came to visit him for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> or instruction. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the sincerity of his reformation, he committed to the flames five books of elegiac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> which he had composed on the subject of his amours, together with numerous pieces in Tuscan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, which had been addressed to his various mistresses. There is perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to lament that the zeal of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> would not be satisfied without this sacrifice. It must, however, be considered that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> exacted many sacrifices from the professors of Christianity, which the lenient temper of these times does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> for. An example of this severity is to be met with amongst the works that still remain of Mirandola; at the end of which, in the folio edition published by his nephew, we find a learned and entertaining comment, in the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of his friend Girolamo Benivieni, entitled *Una <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANZONE\">Canzone</a> de Amore secundo la mente et opusum de Platonici.* \"A poetical treatise upon love, explaining the doctrines of the Platonists.\" The author, Girolamo, informs the reader, in a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, that he had determined to suppress this poem and comment out of regard to his friend's character and his own; deeming it unbecoming a professor of Christianity, in treating of celestial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> love, \"to treat of it as a Platonist and not as a Christian;\" but that having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> it to some of his friends for their perusal, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> and erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> was printed, which obliged him, but not till after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mirandola, to publish it correctly; and he takes care to allege, in excuse for himself, that he has apprized the reader of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the poem, and warned him in all places where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s opinions depart from those of Christ, that the doctrines of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENTILE\">gentile</a> and a heathen are not entitled to the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> compared with the reasonings of the Christian theologians, \"and particularly the irrefragable arguments of the angelic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> St Thomas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUINO\">Aquino</a>.\"\n\nThe first fruit of Mirandola's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> to sacred literature was the Heptaplus, or Comment upon the Six Days of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">Chapter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a>, which was written in 1491. Two years afterwards he published a treatise in ten chapters, *de Enne et Uno,* the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of which was to reconcile the doctrines of Plato and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, and to demonstrate that the disputes of their respective followers originated in a misconception of the opinions of these philosophers relative to the *Enn* and *Unum,* at that time a subject of mighty strife among the learned. This treatise was held in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem by both sides. It was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that the author lived to complete; but he had laid the plan of a vast and comprehensive work, which his early death prevented the execution of. This was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than to confound the seven enemies of the Christian church, by examining and refuting all their errors. In the prosecution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, he had composed and perfected before his death twelve books against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTROLOGY\">astrology</a>, the most popular and the most pernicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> which then infected the world. Paulus Jovius, bishop of Nocera, has left a testimony to the merits of this work, which is above all other encomiums:\u2014\"In this excellent though unfinished work, Mirandola attacked the astrologers with such erudition and keenness, and so ably exposed the absurdity and vanity of the whole art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, that he seems to have deterred the professors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> sciences from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.\"\n\nThis great design, as well as many others which Mirandola had formed, particularly that of a more complete effay towards reconciling the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, was frustrated by his death. From the time that he left Rome, which was soon after the publication of the Apologia, Mirandola generally resided either at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRARA\">Ferrara</a> or at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>. The friendship of the prince of Ferrara and its vicinity to his paternal seat attracted him to the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; but Florence was the most agreeable to him, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of literary men which it afforded, and particularly of Politian and Lorenzo de Medici, with whom he entertained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> friendship. Besides these two illustrious men, his society was cultivated by other eminent scholars, among whom was the learned and unfortunate Hieronymus Savonarola, and Hermolans Barbarus: Petrus Crinitus, the pupil of Politian, mentions him as excelling all his companions in the erudition and eloquence of his conversation. The same author has left us an account of his diligent, laborious studies; for when Politian had expressed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> high admiration of his great genius and learning, Mirandola with singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> answered, c. 2., that he deserved no praise but for his affluence of application.\u2014\"Gratulandum potius, intelligite, affiduis vigilis atque lucubrationibus, quam nostro ingenio plaudendum.\"\n\nHis library likewise is celebrated by the same writer, c. 2., and is said by Francisco de Mirandola to have cost 7000 pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. His accomplishments were not confined to subjects of abstruse literature; in his youth he was much attached to music, in which he acquired such skill, that...\nthat some of his melodies were publicly received, and held in great esteem. It might also be concluded, from an anecdote related by Petrus Crinitus, that he was not unacquainted with physic; for according to that author, when Hermolaus Barbarus was seized at Rome with a dangerous fever, Mirandola sent him from Florence a medicine prepared by himself. No man ever testified a more sincere devotion for learning and philosophy, to the contempt of all other qualifications, than the Prince of Mirandola. He possessed a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>, which he bestowed almost entirely upon works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, except what was spent in collecting books, and entertaining and providing for literary men. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, however, about three years before his death, he made over to his nephew Franciscus his principalities and possessions in Mirandola, and obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> from Maximilian, the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, to whom that principality was subject. He referred to himself only enough to purchase a small estate near Ferrara, where he spent the remainder of his life, except when he resided at Florence, in elegant and learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>. His mother, under whose care he received his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, had destined him for the church; and he was often urged by his friends to embrace the sacred profession, with the certainty of the highest honours and emoluments: but nothing could induce him to quit the life that he had chosen. He died of a fever at Florence, in the year 1494, in the thirty-first year of his age, on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> IX. of France entered that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> on his famous expedition into Italy. That monarch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> of Mirandola's illness, as he approached the city, sent two of his own physicians to his assistance; but in spite of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a>, the violence of his disorder put an end to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> in thirteen days.\n\nWith respect to the works of this author, something has already been said, and little more remains to be observed. The Conclusions afford a very complete specimen of the learning of the age, and of what were deemed the most valuable purposes to which learning could be applied. However useless and unprofitable these purposes may appear to us, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be denied by anyone, who has the curiosity to look through the Conclusions, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of learning, which must have been possessed by the proposer of them, is prodigious; when it is recollected that, at the time he propounded them, he was no more than twenty-three years of age. For there is not the least reason to suppose, that a person whose works prove him to have been a man of profound learning, and who, in an age and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> distinguished by some of the brightest scholars that ever appeared, was ranked by their own judgment among the first, should have challenged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of any of the proposed subjects, without being well provided with the knowledge necessary for such a debate. The manner in which the questions were propounded leave little room to doubt that the author was deeply versed in the respective subjects of them; and the Apology for the accused propositions, particularly those de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALUTE\">Salute</a> Origenis and de Magia atque Cabalae, discover familiarity with the writings of the Fathers, as well as with the Greek and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> classics, and a facility of language and argument that could not be acquired at that age without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> powers of mind. It would be worth while to transcribe the whole of this curious piece for the amusement of such of our readers as may not have access to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, but our limits do not admit of it.\n\nIt is curious to observe how greatly the sudden growth of learning outstripped that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> science. No age, perhaps, was ever so remarkable for the learning which it produced as the period from the middle of the fifteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> to the beginning of the sixteenth; yet, except the ineffable obligations we owe to the learned men of that time for their editions of the classics, later ages have been little benefited by their works, which are either lost or neglected, and even the sciences they treated of exploded and ridiculed. School-divinity and metaphysics, though the most attended to, were not the only studies in which the vast erudition of that age was wasted. The mysterious doctrines of the Cabala formed a favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of some of the most learned scholars. The proposition which laid Pica open to the indignation of the church, was that in which he asserted the orthodoxy of Origen; for Origen, notwithstanding his meritorious labours in the cause of Christianity, his daring zeal and self-martyrdom, and notwithstanding the defence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUSEBIUS\">Eusebius</a>, was configned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the church to inevitable damnation, on account of his errors in the mysteries of the faith. To question his perdition, therefore, was to deny that the church was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPRETER\">interpreter</a> of the divine intentions. The defence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Conclusions is written with a boldness that could hardly be expected from an Italian of the fifteenth century. But the hardest of these propositions was that in which it is asserted, that faith is not in a man's own power. In defending this and the other propositions, which were taxed with heresy, Pica probably relied less on the spirit and ability of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, than on his own high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and station, together with the countenance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of his powerful friends, particularly the Medici, whose liberality of sentiment in regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> points was so notorious, that even Leo X. has been directly charged, not only with heresy, but infidelity.*\n\n* Milner's Hist. of the Church, vol. iv.\n\nBy the Cabala, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> at this time generally misapprehended, was understood sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of divine magic operating by the agency of good spirits, as magic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> so called was supposed to do by that of evil beings; but the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of it, as received by the best of its professors, is given by Reuchlinus (a), in his treatise addressed to Lorenzo de Medici, Divinae Revelationis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> salutarem Dei et formarum separatarum contemplationem traditae symbolica receptio,\u2014a symbolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of the Mosaic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> (for that is meant by divina <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>) which produced a pure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> acquaintance with the nature of the divinity and of spirits; and according to the opinions of some, which seem to be revived by the modern Swedenborgians, this knowledge, when sublimed to the highest perfection it was capable of, and accompanied with perfect purity, was believed to\n\n(a) This treatise, which contains the whole learning upon a subject once held in the highest veneration by men of learning, is very curious, and is to be found in the folio edition of Mirandola's works, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, in 1557.\nto raise the mind to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> familiarity with good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, by whose affluence the professors of the cabalistic secrets were enabled to do miraculous things. This art was derived from the rabbinical doctors, who were at first called Thalmudists; and, about the middle of the 15th century, according to Pica de Mirandola, its professors were denominated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABALISTS\">Cabalists</a>, Cabalists, or Cabalists, according to their different degrees of perfection: they afterwards, however, departed from their masters the Thalmudists; the latter, according to Reuchlinus, being chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> upon the law and the explanation of it, while the former, paying less regard to what concerned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs, aimed chiefly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of mind and thought. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and doctrines of the Cabalists seem to have been well known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, and perhaps fuggetted some pallages in Paradise Lost. In Reuchlinus's Exposition of their mysteries there is a curious passage describing the speech of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> to the heavenly spirits after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> prospect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCARNATION\">incarnation</a> of the Messiah, whom the Cabalists recognised in the character of a celestial Adam (b); and, among the books relating to these doctrines, which are said to be lost, mention is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBER\">Liber</a> Bellorum Domini. The mysteries of the Pythagorean philosophy, which, according to Philolaus apud Reuchlinum, sprung from the same source, were also studied and taught with great fervency during this period. Mirandola and Paulus Riccius were the first who explained the Cabalistic mysteries in Latin, and the former, in his Apology, has employed much labour and learning in defending them, as well as the science of natural magic, from the vulgar idea that necromancy was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of them. His writings, however, upon that subject were few, and we do not know whether they still exist; but it may be collected from the following proposition in his Conclusions, and some others of a similar nature, that he, like all the scholars of his time, had bestowed much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> upon this useless learning:\n\n\"Qui scierit quid sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENARIUS\">denarius</a> in Arithmetica formalis, et cognoverit natura primi numeri sph\u00e6rici, sciet secretum quinquaginta portarum intelligentiae et magni jubelaei, et millesimae generationis, et regnum omnium seculorum.\"\n\nThose who are well acquainted with the tenets of the modern millenniums will be able to tell whether there be any connection between them and the allusions in the concluding part of this proposition.\n\nMagic also entered deeply into the learning of this era. This comprises two distinct sciences, that of natural magic, and that of demonology: the first was concerned only in the properties of numbers and figures, and some of the more hidden properties of nature. This knowledge enabled its professors to produce many effects from natural causes, which, when science was less diffused than at present, appeared to be the effect of something superior to the common limits of human power. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBERTUS\">Albertus</a>, commonly called Magnus, the friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> of Roger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, was the most celebrated of those who excelled in this sort of knowledge. This science has been productive of many admirable discoveries in mathematics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>. Magic, in its common signification, or necromancy, was also eagerly studied at this time, as appears from Cornelius Agrippa's strange work upon that subject; and we may judge of the estimation in which it was held, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a> that writer makes in his book De vanitate omnium Scientiarum, that while he professed that science, he derived more credit and profit from it, than from any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> he ever could make of his learning. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> was said to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, whose magic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> and glaifs are still famous in eastern demonology.\n\nBut the most dangerous, the most popular, and the most pernicious delusion which the darkness of the preceding ages had entailed upon mankind, was astrology, which will perhaps never be utterly exterminated from the minds of the vulgar, but which then possessed all ranks. When these considerations are taken into the account, it must be looked upon as no despicable application of learning and talents, to have exposed the fallacy and absurdity of this delusion; and when we recollect the great learning and credit of some of its upholders, among whom our countryman Roger Bacon was the most esteemed; the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> entertained of it, and the few lights which mankind then possessed, as to the real and constant laws obeyed by the celestial bodies; it cannot be denied that the twelve books written by Mirandola against astrology, the effect of which, in opening men's eyes upon that subject is testified by a respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> author, were the work of a very superior and enlightened mind. When we congratulate ourselves upon our freedom from these superstitions, we ought not to forget, that we owe something to those who gave the first blow to them. Proud of the lights of the age we live in, when astrology and such like cheats are no longer in vogue, we are too apt to overlook the merit of those exertions which first exposed and refuted them; and to persuade ourselves, that in these days of genius and philosophy, such exertions would have been unnecessary; not recollecting that if we enjoy many superiorities of this kind, we are less indebted for them to our own genius than to the labours of those who first paved the way for the detection of superstitious errors; our merit is, that we do not shut our eyes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of science; but while we enjoy its blaze, we ought to be grateful to those who struck the first sparks.\n\nJohn Pica of Mirandola has been represented by writers; whose ideas are taken from the encomiums of his contemporaries, as a mighty prodigy of learning and genius. The dilliance which the present times entertain towards those subjects upon which he wrote, renders it very difficult, upon a review of his works, to think those encomiums justified. But making allowance for this change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and weighing the impartial testimony of his equals, and the early age at which he obtained their admiration, it may be fairly concluded, he was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, a man of very extraordinary powers. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> are principally collected from his letters, and the account given of him by his nephew Francisco, himself\n\n(b) Conjicimus fane, alterum esse Adam caelestem angelis in coelo demonstratum, unum ex Deo, quem verbo fecerat, et alterum esse Adam terrenum, repulsum a Deo, quem ex luto manibus suis finxerat.

With this pretence he taught his followers to give themselves up to all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPURITY\">impurity</a>; saying that therein consisted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of the sons of God; and that all those not of their sect were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a>. He first published his notions in Germany and the Low Countries, and persuaded many people to go naked, and gave them the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAMITES\">Adamites</a>. After this he seized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> in the river Laufnecz, some leagues from Thabor, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of Zizka, where he fixed himself and his followers. His women were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, but none were allowed to enjoy them without his permission: so that when any man desired a particular woman, he carried her to Picard, who gave him leave in these words, Go, increase, multiply, and fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, however, Zizka, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of the Hussites, (famous for his victories over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Sigismund), hurt at their abominations, marched against them, made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of their island, and put them all to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> except two; whom he spared, that he might learn their doctrine.\n\nSuch is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> which various writers, relying on the authorities of \u00c6neas Sylvius and Varillas, have given of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PICARDS\">Picards</a>, who appear to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> of the Vaudois, that fled from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> in their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and sought refuge in Bohemia. It is indeed doubtful whether a sect of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a>, chargeable with such wild principles and such licentious conduct, ever existed: and it is certainly astonishing that Mr Bayle, in his art, Picards, should adopt the reproachful representations of the writers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned: for it appears probable at least that the whole is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALUMNY\">calumny</a> invented and propagated in order to disgrace the Picards, merely because they deserted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> and protested against the errors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome.\n\nLafitius informs us, that Picard, together with 40 other persons, besides women and children, settled in Bohemia in the year 1418. Balbinus the Jesuit, in his Epitome Rerum Bohemicarum, lib. ii. gives a similar account, and charges on the Picards none of the extravagancies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> crimes ascribed to them by Sylvius. Schlecta, secretary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADISLAUS\">Ladislaus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Bohemia, in his letters to Erasmus in which he gives a particular account of the Picards, says that they considered the pope, cardinals, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> of Rome, as the true Antichrists, and the adorers of the consecrated elements in the eucharist as downright idolaters; that they denied the corporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of Christ in this ordinance; that they condemned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> of saints, prayers for the dead, auricular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> imposed by priests, the feasts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIGILS\">vigils</a> observed in the Romish church; and that they confined themselves to the observance of the Sabbath, and of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> feasts of Christmas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENTECOST\">Pentecost</a>. From this account, it would appear that they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other than the Vaudois; and M. de Beaufobre has shown that they were both of the same sect, though under different denominations. Besides, it is certain that the Vaudois\nwere settled in Bohemia in the year 1178, where some of them adopted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of the Greek, and others those of the Latin church. The former were pretty generally adhered to till the middle of the 14th century, when the establishment of the Latin rites caused great disturbance. On the commencement of the national troubles in Bohemia, on account of the opposition to the papal power (see Moravians), the Picards more publicly avowed and defended their religious opinions; and they formed a considerable body in an island by the river Launitz or Laufneez, in the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BECHIN\">Bechin</a>, and recurring to arms, were defeated by Zifca.

A very fruitful territory, and very populous. Picentes, the people, (Cicero); from the singular Picen, (Livy): different from the Picentini on the Tuscan sea, though called so by the Greeks; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> calls them Piceni, as does also Pliny. Their territory at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is supposed to form the greatest part of the March of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCONA\">Ancona</a>, (Cluverius).\n\nPickford, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Salop in England; on the south-east side of Shrewsbury, near Condover. It is noted for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of pitchy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> (from whence some derive its name), on the top of which there always flows a sort of liquid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">bitumen</a>. Over most of the coal pits in this neighbourhood there lies a stratum of blackish rock; of which, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a>, they make pitch and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAR\">tar</a>, and also distil an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> from it.\n\nPichincha, or Pinchinca, a mountain in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>.

It is said to have been built 270 years before Christ by Peridurus, Pickering, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the Britons, who was buried here. It had once a castle, the ruins of which are still to be seen; to whose jurisdiction many of the neighbouring villages were subject; and the adjacent territory, commonly called Pickering-Lath, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> or forest of Pickering, was given by Henry III. to his son Edmund <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Lancaster.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> lies about four leagues south-west from St George, twelve from Terceira, and about three leagues south-east of Fayal; in W. Long. 28\u00b0 21' and N. Lat. 39\u00b0 29'. The mountain Pico, which gives name to the island, is filled with dismal dark caverns or volcanoes, which frequently vomit out flames, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, to a great distance. At the foot of this mountain towards the east is a spring of fresh water, generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, but sometimes heated with the subterraneous fire, as to rush forth in torrents with a kind of ebullition like boiling water; equalling that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and feeding forth a stream of fulminous feld vapours, liquefied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, minerals, and flakes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> all on fire, in such quantities, and with such violence, as to have formed a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> vulgarly called Mysterios, on the declivity of the coast, and at the distance of 1200 paces from the fountain. Such at least is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of Ortelius; though we do not find this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> circumstance of the promontory confirmed by later observations. The circumference of Pico is computed at about 15 leagues: and its most remarkable places are Pico, Lagosas, Santa Cruz or Cruz, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAN_SEBASTIAN\">San Sebastian</a>, Pequin, San Rocko, Playa, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGDALENA\">Magdalena</a>; the inhabitants of which live wholly on the produce of the island, in great plenty and felicity. The cattle are various, numerous, and excellent in their several kinds: it is the same with the vine; and its juice, prepared into different wines, the best in the Azores.\nBesides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, they have a kind of wood which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> teixo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and hard as iron; and veined, when finely polished, like a rich scarlet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABBY\">tabby</a>; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> it has in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. The longer it is kept, the more beautiful it grows: hence it is, that the teixo tree is felled only for the king's use or by his order; and is prohibited from being exported as a common article of trade.\n\nPico Marina, a sea fish common at Kongo in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, derives its name from the resemblance of its mouth to the beak of a woodpecker. It is of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, and prodigious strength, has four fins on its back, three under its belly, and one on each side of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; its tail is large and forked, by which it cuts the waves with surprising force and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>. It is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with every fish that swims, and with everything it meets in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, without being intimidated by the largest vessels; a surprising instance of which intrepidity, we are told by some mariners, whose ship was attacked by one of them, near these coasts, in the dead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. The violence of the shock which it gave to the vessel quickly awakened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the people; who immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAN\">ran</a> to the ship's side, where they perceived, by moonlight, this huge monster fastened by its forehead to the vessel, and making the strongest efforts to disengage itself; upon which some of them tried to pierce him with their pikes, but he got off before they could accomplish their aim. On the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, upon visiting that side of the vessel, they found a piece of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> snout stuck fast into the wood, and two or three inches of it projecting outwards. In the inside of the ship, there was discovered about five or six inches more of the point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, which had penetrated through the plank. But we must observe, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of the times probably rendered this animal thus formidable.\n\nPicquering, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> war, or skirmish, made by foldiers detached from two armies for pillage, or before a main battle begins.\n\nPicquet, or Picquet. See Picquet.\n\nPicramnia, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the dioecia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>; and in the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> ranking with those that are doubtful.

The name is expressive of its sensible qualities.\n\nEvery part of this tree is intensely bitter; and even after the tree has been laid for floors many years, whoever rubs or scrapes the wood, feels a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of bitterness in their mouth or throat. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABINET\">Cabinet</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> made of this wood is very useful, as no insect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> live near it.\n\nThis tree has a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the Quassia Amara of Linnaeus; in lieu of which it is used as an antiseptic in putrid fevers. When used, less of it will do than of the Quassia Amara of Surinam.

See Botany Index.\n\nPicrium, a genus of plants, belonging to the tetrandria class; and in the natural method ranking with those that are doubtful. See Botany Index.\n\nPicet, Benedict, a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>, in 1655, of a distinguished family, and prosecuted his studies with great success. After having traveled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> and England, he taught theology in his own country with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> reputation. The university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, after the death of Spanreina, solicited him to come and fill his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; but he thought that his own country had the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to his services; and for that generosity he received its thanks by the mouth of the members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>. A languishing disorder, occasioned by too much fatigue, hastened his death: which happened on the 9th of June 1724, at the age of 69 years. This minister had much sweetness and affability in his manner. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> found in him a comforter and a father. He published a great number of works in Latin and French, which are much esteemed in Protestant countries. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of these are,\n\n1. A System of Christian Theology in Latin, 3 vols. in 4to; the best edition of which is that of 1712.\n2. Christian Morality, printed at Geneva, 1710, 8 vols. in 12mo.\n3. The History of the 11th and 12th centuries; intended as a sequel to that of Sueur, printed in 1713, 2 vols. in 4to. The Continuator is held in higher estimation than the first author.\n4. Several Controversial Treatises.\n5. A great number of tracts on morality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>; among which we must distinguish \"the Art of Living and Dying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>;\" published at Geneva, 1725, in 12mo.\n6. Some Letters.\n7. Some Sermons, from 1697 to 1721; 4 vols. in 8vo. With a vast number of other books, the names of which it would be tedious to mention; but which, as Mr Sennebier says, \"all show evident marks of piety and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>.\"\n\nPicet, John-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> of Geneva, born in 1739, was of the same family. He was member of the Council of Two Hundred; Counsellor of State and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNDIC\">Syndic</a>; and died in 1781. He applied himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and made several voyages into France and England for his improvement. Few men were ever blest with a clearer or more enlightened understanding. He has left in manuscript the \"Journal of a Voyage which he made to Russia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> in 1768 and 1769, in order to observe the transit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s disk.\" A work very interesting, from the lively descriptions which it gives both of men and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nPictland. See Pentland.\n\nPicts, the name of one of those nations who anciently possessed the north of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. It is generally believed that they were so called from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> their bodies; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which Camden supports with great erudition. (See Gough's edition, Vol. I. p. xci. of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>). It is certainly liable, however, to considerable objections; for as this custom prevailed among the other ancient inhabitants of Britain, who used the glaifum of Pliny and the virum of Mela for the like purpose, it may be asked, Why the name of Picti was confined by the Romans to only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, when it was equally applicable to many others? Why should they dignify them only by an epithet, without ever annexing their proper name? Or why should they impose a new name on this people only, when they give their proper name to every other tribe which they have occasion to speak of? As these questions cannot be answered in any satisfactory manner, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> we must look for some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a> of the name.\n\nThe Highlanders of Scotland, who speak the ancient language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALEDONIA\">Caledonia</a>, express the name of this once fa-\nPicts\n\nmous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Pictish; a name familiar to the ears of the most illiterate, who could never have derived it from the Roman authors. The word Pictish means pilferers or plunderers. The appellation was probably imposed upon this people by their neighbours, or assumed by themselves, some time after the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARACALLA\">Caracalla</a>, when the ungarded state of the Roman province, on which this people bordered, gave them frequent opportunities of making incursions thither, and committing depredations. Accordingly this name seems to have been unknown till the end of the 3rd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. Eumenius the panegyrist is the first Roman author who mentions this people under their new name of Pictish, or, with a Latin termination, Pisci. When we say that this name may have been probably assumed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now mentioned, we must observe, that, in those days of violence, the character of a robber was attended with no disgrace. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to form his schemes well, and to execute them successfully, he was rather praised than blamed for his conduct; providing he made no encroachments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of his own tribe or any of its allies. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> this as no peculiar stigma upon the Picts; for other nations of antiquity, in the like rude state, thought and acted as they did. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a>, lib. iii. p. 3. and Virg. Aen. vii. 745 et 749.\n\nConcerning the origin of the Picts, authors are much divided. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOETHIUS\">Boethius</a> derives them from the Agathyrsi, Pomponius Laetus from the Germans, Bede from the Scythians, Camden (A) and Father Innes from the ancient Britons, Stillingfleet from a people inhabiting the Cimbrica Cheronesus, and Keating and O'Flaherty, on the authority of the Cathol Pfister, derive them from the Thracians. But the most probable opinion is, that they were the descendants of the old Caledonians. Several reasons are urged in support of this opinion by Dr Macpherson; and the words of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUMENES\">Eumenes</a>, \"Caledonum, aliorumque Pictorum, filvas,\" &c. plainly imply that the Picts and Caledonians were one and the same people.\n\nAs there has been much dispute about the origin of the Picts, so there has been likewise about their language. There are many reasons which make it plain that their tongue was the Gaelic or Celtic; and these reasons are a further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of their having been of Caledonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>. Through the east and north-east coasts of Scotland (which were possessed by the Picts) we meet with an innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of names of places, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, mountains, &c., which are manifestly Gaelic. From a very old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the priory of St Andrew's (Dalrymple's Collections, p. 122.) it appears, that in the days of Hungus, the last Pictish king of that name, St Andrew's was called Mubrofs; and that the town now called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEENSFERRY\">Queensferry</a> had the name of Ardochinnachan. Both these words are plain Gaelic. The first signifies \"the heath or promontory of boars;\" and the latter, \"the height or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Kenneth.\" In the list of Pictish kings published by Father Innes, most of the names are obviously Gaelic, and in many instances the same with the names in the list of Scottish or Caledonian kings published by the same author. Had Innes understood anything of this language, he would not have supposed with Camden that the Picts spoke the British tongue. It was unlucky that the two words on which they built their conjecture (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATH\">Strath</a> and Aber) are as common in the Gaelic as they could have been in the British, and at this day make a part of the names of places in countries to which the Pictish empire never extended. The names of Strathfillan and Lochaber may serve as instances.\n\nThe venerable Bede, as much a stranger to the Celtic as either of the antiquaries just now mentioned, is equally unhappy in the specimen which he gives of the Pictish language in the word penauhel, \"the head of the wall.\" Allowing the commutation of the initial p into c, as in some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, this word has still the same meaning in Gaelic which Bede gives it in the Pictish. It is true, there might have been then, as well as now, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between various dialects of the Celtic; and thus, perhaps, that pious author was led to discover five languages in Britain agreeably to the five books of Moses: a contest from which the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> derived a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of harmless satisfaction.\n\nThe Picts of the earliest ages, as appears from the Territory, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> testimony of all writers who have examined the subject, possessed only the east and north-east coast of Scotland. On one side, the ancient Drumalbin, or that ridge of mountains reaching from Lochlomond near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUMBARTON\">Dumbarton</a> to the frith of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">Tain</a>, which separates the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUTHERLAND\">Sutherland</a> from a part of Ross, was the boundary of the Pictish dominions. Accordingly we find in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Columba, that, in travelling to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Bruidis, king of the Picts, he travelled over Drumalbin, the Dorfium Britanniae of Adamnan. On the other side, the territory of the Picts was bounded by the Roman province. After Britain was relinquished by the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HONORIUS\">Honorius</a>, they and the Saxons by turns were masters of those countries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> between the frith of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> and the river Tweed. We learn from Bede, that the Saxons were masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a> when he finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">Ecclesiastical</a> History. The Picts, however, made a conquest of that country soon after; so that, before the extinction of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, all the territories bounded on the one side by the Forth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a>, and on the other by the Tweed and Solway, fell into their hands.\n\nThe history of the Picts, as well as of all the other ancient inhabitants of Britain, is involved in obscurity. The Irish historians give us a long list of Pictish kings, who reigned over Pictavia for the space of 11 or 13 centuries before the Christian era. After them Innes, in his Critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a>, gives us a list of above fifty, of whom no less than five held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a>, each for a whole century. It is probable that these writers had confounded the history of the Picts with that of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> the old Caledonians. In any other view, their accounts of them are highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>; and have been long ago confuted by Dr Macpherson of Slate, an antiquary of much learning and research. The Picts, as has been already.\n\n(a) See Gough's edition of Camden, Vol. I. Preface, p. xc. and the Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History, Vol. XVII. p. 39, &c.\nPicts already oblerved, were probably not known by that name before the 2d or 3d century. Adamnan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONA\">Iona</a>, is the first author that expressly mentions any Pictish king; and the oldest after him is Bede. We are informed by these two writers, that St Columba converted Brudius king of the Picts to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. Columba came into Britain in the year of the vulgar era 565. Before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> we have no general record to ascertain so much as the name of any Pictish king. The history of Druft or Dreft, who is said to have reigned over the Picts in the beginning of the fifth century, when St Ninian first preached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> to that nation, has all the appearance of fiction (b). His having reigned a hundred years, and his putting an end to a hundred wars, are stories which exceed all the bounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>.\n\nBrudius, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> of Columba, is the first Pictish king mentioned by any writer of authority.\n\nWhat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> his ancestors made, or who were his successors on the throne of Pictavia, cannot be ascertained. Bede informs us, that, during the reign of one of them, the Picts killed Egfred king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a> in battle, and destroyed the greatest part of his army. The same author mentions another of their kings called Naitan, for whom he had a particular regard. It was to this Naitan that Ceolfrid, abbot of Wiremouth, wrote his famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a> and the Tonfure (c); a letter in which Bede himself is supposed to have had a principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Roger Hoveden and Simon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a> mention two other Pictish kings Onnus and Kinoth, the first of whom died in 761, and the latter flourished about the 774, and gave an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> to Alfred of Northumberland, who was much about that time expelled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. The accounts given by the Scots historians of several other Pictish kings cannot be depended on; nor are the stories told by the British historians, Geoffrey of Monmouth and the author of the Eulogium Britanniae, worthy of much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>.\n\nIn the ninth century the Pictish nation was totally subdued by the Scots in the reign of Kenneth Macalpin. Since that time their name has been lost in that of the conquerors, with whom they were incorporated after this conquest; however, they seem to have been treated by the Scottish kings with great lenity, so that for some ages after they commanded a great deal of respect. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> of Hogulthead, an old English historian, relates, that they made a considerable figure in the army of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> the Saint, in his disputes with Stephen king of England. In a battle fought in the year 1136, by the English on one side, and the Scots and Picts on the other, the latter insisted on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> right of leading the van of the Scots army, and were indulged in that request by the king,\n\nThe principal seat of the Pictish kings was at Abernethy. Brudius, however, as appears from the accounts given by Adamnan, in his life of Columba, had a palace at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>, which was probably near the extremity of his territory in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>; for there is no good reason for believing, with Camden, that this king had any property in the Western Isles, or that he had made a gift of Iona to St Columba when he visited him in that place.\n\nWith respect to the manners and customs of the Picts, there is no reason to suppose they were any other than those of the old Caledonians and Scots, of which many particulars are related in the Greek and Roman writers who have occasion to speak of those nations.\n\nUpon the decline of the Roman empire, cohorts of barbarians were raised, and Picts were invited into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, by Honorius, when peace was everywhere restored, and were named Honoriaei. Those under Constantine opened the passes of the Pyrenean mountains, and let the barbarous nations into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. From this period we date the civilization of their manners, which happened after they had by themselves, and then with the Scots, ravaged this Roman province.\n\nPicts Wall, in antiquity, a wall begun by the emperor Adrian, on the northern bounds of England; to prevent the incursions of the Picts and Scots.

Nay, farther, we do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to assert, that roughness forms the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the beautiful and the picturesque; as it seems to be that particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> which makes\n\n(b) According to Camden, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> happened about the year 630, in the southern Pictish provinces; while the northern, which were separated by fruitful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, were converted by Columba.\n\n(c) We are told by some authors that Columba taught the Picts to celebrate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a> always on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> between the 14th and 20th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, and to observe a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONSURE\">tonsure</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, leaving an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>.

Both ideas, however, equally enter into the picturesque, and both are observable in the smaller as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as in the larger parts of nature; in the outline and bark of a tree, as in the rude summit and craggy sides of a mountain.\n\nLet us then examine our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and try how far these qualities enter into the idea of picturesque beauty, and how far they mark that difference among objects which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of our inquiry.\n\n\"A piece of Palladian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> may be elegant in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of its parts, the propriety of its ornaments, and the symmetry of the whole, may be highly pleasing; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we introduce it in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, it immediately becomes a formal object, and ceases to please. Should we wish to give it picturesque beauty, we must use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a> instead of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHISEL\">chisel</a>; we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> one half of it, deface the other, and throw the mutilated members around in heaps; in short, from a smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> we must turn it into a rough ruin. No painter who had the choice of the two objects would hesitate a moment.\n\n\"Again, why does an elegant piece of garden-ground make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> on canvas? The shape is pleasing, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the objects harmonious, and the winding of the walk in the very line of beauty. All this is true; but the smoothness of the whole, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and as it should be in nature, offends in picture. Turn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> into a piece of broken ground, plant rugged oaks instead of flowering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the edges of the walk, give it the rudeness of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, mark it with wheel tracks, and scatter around a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> and brushwood; in a word, instead of making the whole smooth, make it rough, and you make it also picturesque. All the other ingredients of beauty it already possesses.\" On the whole, picturesque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> consists in uniting in one whole, a variety of parts, and these parts can only be obtained from rough objects.\n\nIt is possible, therefore, to find picturesque objects among works of art, and it is possible to make objects so; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of picturesque beauty is nature in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> variety, and in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> grandeur. \"We seek it (says our author) among all the ingredients of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>, trees, rocks, broken grounds, woods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, plains, valleys, mountains, and distances. These objects in themselves produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> variety; no two rocks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> trees are exactly the same; they are varied a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> by combination; and almost as much a third time by different lights and shades and other aerial effects. Sometimes we find among them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of a whole, but oftener we find only beautiful parts.\"\n\nSublimity or grandeur alone cannot make an object picturesque: for, as our author remarks, \"however grand the mountain or the rocks may be, it has no claim to this epithet, unless its form, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, or its accompaniments, have some degree of beauty. Nothing can be more sublime than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>; but wholly unaccompanied, it has little of the picturesque. When we talk therefore of a sublime object, we always understand that it is also beautiful; and we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it sublime or beautiful only as the ideas of sublimity or simple beauty prevail. But it is not only the form and the composition of the objects of landscape which the picturesque eye examines; it connects them with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and feels for all those various effects which are produced from that vast and wonderful storehouse of nature. Nor is there in travelling a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> than when a scene of grandeur bursts unexpectedly upon the eye, accompanied with some accidental circumstance of the atmosphere which harmonizes with it, and gives it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> value.\"\n\nThere are few places so barren as to afford no picturesque scene.\n\nBelieve the muse,\nShe does not know that insipidious spot\nWhere beauty is thus niggard of her store.\nBelieve the muse, through this terrestrial waste\nThe seeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> are sown, profusely sown,\nEven where we least may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>.\n\nMr Gilpin mentions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> road between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a> and Carlisle as the most barren tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in England; and yet there, he says, there is \"always something to amuse the eye. The interchangeable patches of heath and green-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> make an agreeable variety. Often too on these vast tracts of intersecting grounds we see beautiful lights, softening off along the sides of hills; and often we see them adorned with cattle, flocks of sheep, heath-cocks, grouse, plover, and flights of other wild fowl. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of cattle standing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> on the edge of a dark hill, and relieved by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> beyond them, will often make a complete picture without any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPANIMENT\">accompaniment</a>. In many other situations also we find them wonderfully pleasing, and capable of making pictures amidst all the deficiencies of landscape. Even a winding road itself is an object of beauty; while the richness of the heath on each side, with the little hillocks and crumbling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, give many an excellent lesson for a foreground. When we have no opportunity of examining the grand scenery of nature, we have everywhere at least the means of observing with what a multiplicity of parts, and yet with what general simplicity, she covers every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>.\n\n\"But if we let the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> loose, even scenes like these administer great amusement. The imagination can plant hills; can form rivers and lakes in valleys; can build castles and abbeys; and, if it find no other amusement, can dilate itself in vast ideas of space.\"\n\nMr Gilpin, after describing such objects as may be called picturesque, proceeds to consider their sources of amusement. We cannot follow our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author through the whole of this consideration, and shall therefore finish our article with a short quotation from the beginning of it. \"We might begin (says he) in moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, and consider the objects of nature in a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> than merely as amusement. We might observe, that a search after beauty should naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the mind to the great origin of all beauty; to the first good, first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>, and first fair.\n\nBut though in theory this seems a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> climax, we infall the less upon it, as in fact we have scarce ground to hope that every admirer of picturesque beauty is an admirer.\nPIE\n\nPicturcous admirer also of the beauty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; and that every lover of nature reflects, that Beauty is but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> for an effect,\n\nWhole cayce is God.\n\nIf, however, the admirer of nature can turn his amusements to a higher purpose; if its great scenes can inspire him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> awe, or its tranquil scenes with that complacency of mind which is so nearly allied that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, it is certainly the better. Apponat lucro. It is so much into the bargain; for we dare not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> him more from picturesque travel than a rational and agreeable amusement.

This country is in some parts mountainous, but is everywhere very fruitful. The plains produce fine corn, and Montferrat and the Milanese yield <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> wheat, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> serves for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, and with which the people of the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> mix rye; the pods are used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, and the stalks being thick serve to mend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>. The hills produce plenty of wine, which, like the Italian wines, is very delicious when new, especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. There is also a tartish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> wine called vino brufco, said to be very wholesome for fat people, and, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the sweet wine is recommended as a stomachic. The neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a> is famous for its fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, and many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> walks of chestnut and mulberry trees, which produce both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and profit. Marons, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> chestnuts, are a favourite dainty among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people.

Truffles grow here in such abundance, that Piedmont has obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the truffle country. Some are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, others white marbled with red. Their price is rated according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>. Sometimes they are found of 12 or 14 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; and many country people earn from 60 to 70 dollars a-year merely by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> for them. The trade in cattle is said to bring into Piedmont <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than three millions of livres per annum. The cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> is also a profitable article, the Piedmontese silk being, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its fineness and strength, esteemed the best in Italy. The Piedmontese gentry breed vast numbers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SILK_WORMS\">silk-<a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> under the care of their tenants, who have the eggs and mulberry leaves delivered to them, and in return they give half the silk to their masters. This principality comprehends eleven small provinces: Piedmont proper, the valleys between France and Italy, the valley of Saluzza, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Nice, the marquisate of Sula, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Ao\u00ebt, the Canavese, the lordship of Vettai,\nPiedmont, fail, the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFT\">Aft</a>, and the Langes. It was formerly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, but now belongs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>, and lies at the foot of the Alps, which separate France from Italy. It contains many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mountains, among which there are rich and fruitful valleys, as pleasant and populous as any part of Italy. In the mountains are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of several kinds, and the forests afford a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, among which the tumor is an useful animal. \"The mules (says Mr Watkins) are very fine in this country; but the inhabitants have other beasts, or rather monsters which they find very serviceable, though vicious and obstinate. These are produced by a cow and an ass, or mare and bull, and called jumarres or gimerri (A). I cannot say that I have ever seen any of them, but I am told they are very common.\"\n\nThe Piedmontese are said to be more intelligent than the Savoyards, but less sincere. Some authors represent them as lively, artful, and witty, the inhabitants of the mountain of Aoita excepted, who are farther distinguished by large wens, as even their horses, dogs, and other animals. Mr Baretti, however, in his Account of Italy, vol. ii. p. 116, gives the following account of them. \"One of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> qualities (says he), which distinguish the Piedmontese from all other Italians, is their want of cheerfulness. Piedmont never produced a single good poet, as far as the records of the country can go, whereas there is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Italy but what can boast of some poet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>; and yet the Piedmontese are not deficient in several branches of learning, and some of them have succeeded tolerably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, physic, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. It is likewise observed of this people, that none of them ever attained to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of excellence in the polite arts, and it is but lately that they can boast of a painter, Cavaliere Bontempe; a flautist, Signor Lodetto; and some architects, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTE\">Conte</a> Alferi, Signor Borra, and others, who yet, to say the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, are far inferior to numberless artists produced by the other provinces of Italy. They have, on the other hand, greatly advanced when considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>; though their troops have never been very numerous, every body conversant in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> knows the brave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> they made for some centuries past against the French, Spaniards, and Germans, whenever they have been invaded by these nations. The skill of the Piedmontese in fortification is likewise very great, and their Bertolas and Pintos have shown as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> as the Vaubans and Cohorns, in rendering impregnable several places which inferior engineers would only have made secure.\"\n\nThe chief trade of this principality consists in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> and silk. Indeed, so great is their trade in raw silk, that the English alone have purchased to the value of 200,000 lib. in a year. The silk worm thrives so well, that many peasants make above (B) 100 lib. of silk annually; and it is not only abundant, but universally known to be stronger and finer than any in Italy. The land owners divide the profit with their tenants. The Piedmontese workmen, however, are said to want <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, though they finish their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> equally well with those of other nations. The high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> and land carriage on mules likewise tend to lessen the value of this trade. They have besides corn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, wine, fruits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, and cattle.\n\nIn the valleys of Lucerne, Peyrouse, and St Martin, which have always belonged to Piedmont, live the celebrated Waldenses or Vaudois, a name which signifies people of the valleys. These have rendered themselves famous in history for their dissent from the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> long before the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Calvin, and for the persecutions they have suffered on that account; but since the year 1730 they have not been openly molested for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, but, in order to suppress them by degrees, a papal church has been built in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>. They are heavily taxed, and labour under great oppressions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people in these valleys scarce at present exceeds 15,000, of which 1000 are Catholics. The chief river of Piedmont is the Po, which flows out of Mount Vilo. The river Sesia, the Doria, Baltea, the ancient Drunta, the Tenaro, and several others, run into it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-VAR\">Var</a>, anciently called the Varus, rises in the county of Nice, and after watering it empties itself into the Mediterranean. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the Piedmontese is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of French and Italian. In this country are about 50 earldoms, 15 marquises, a multitude of lordships, and 20 abbeys. Though the country be entirely popish, except some valleys inhabited by the Waldenses, the king reserves to himself the greatest part of the power in church affairs, which in many other places is given up to the pope, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> unigenitus is here universally opposed. Towards the end of the 17th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the French king persuaded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Savoy to drive them out of the country; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which 200,000 of them retired to Germany, England, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and yet they are not all extirpated, though, as we have observed, they are obliged to have a Roman Catholic church in every parish.\n\nTurin, formerly the residence of the king of Sardinia, to whom this principality belonged, is the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. See Turin. The number of inhabitants, Mr Watkins says, in Piedmont and Savoy, amount to 2,695,727 souls, of which Turin contains about 77,000. Piedmont, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of Italy, few of our readers need be informed, is now subject to the overgrown power of France.","sp":156,"ep":157},{"h":"PIENES","t":"a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, opposite to the harbour of Saccat, is famed not only for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of its walks, to which crowds of people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, but for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a> worshipped there, to which vast numbers of persons devote themselves.

A learned and elegant writer has said that the want of piety arises from the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>; and his observations and arguments are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and so well expressed, that we cannot do better than transcribe them.\n\n\"It appears to me (says Dr Knox), that the mind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, when it is free from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> defects and acquired corruption, feels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less a tendency to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> than to virtuous love, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to any other of the more refined and elevated affections. But debauchery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> contribute greatly to destroy all the susceptible delicacy with which nature usually furnishes the heart; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> extinction of our better qualities, it is no wonder that so pure a sentiment as that of piety should be one of the first to expire.\n\n\"It is certain that the understanding may be improved in a knowledge of the world, and in the arts of succeeding in it, while the heart, or whatever constitutes the seat of the moral and sentimental feelings, is gradually receding from its proper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. Indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> seems to evince, that it is hardly possible to arrive at the character of a complete man of the world, without losing many of the most valuable sentiments of uncorrupted nature. A complete man of the world is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> being; he has discarded many of the native and laudable tendencies of his mind, and adopted a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of objects and propensities of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. These are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a>, coarse, lordly, selfish, and sensual. All, or either of these attributes, tend directly to blunt the senses of every thing liberal, enlarged, disinterested; of every thing which participates more of an intellectual than of a sensual nature. When the heart is tied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> by lust and avarice, it is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> that the eye should be\nPietv. seldom lifted up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. To the man who spends his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> (because he thinks the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> fit for little else) in the counting-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, in travelling, in the tavern, or in the brothel, those who go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> appear as fools, and the busines they go upon as nonsense. He is callous to the feelings of devotion; but he is tremblingly alive to all that gratifies his senses or promotes his interests.\n\n\"It has been remarked of those writers who have attacked Christianity, and represented all religions merely as diversified modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, that they were indeed, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, men of a metaphysical and a disputatious turn of mind, but usually little distinguished for benignity and generosity. There was, amidst all their pretensions to logical sagacity, a cloudiness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, and a coldness of heart, which rendered them very unfit judges on a question in which the heart is chiefly interested; in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of nature is more expressive and convincing, than all the dreary subtleties of the dismal metaphysicians. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, on which we so greatly value ourselves, may be perverted by excessive refinement; and there is an abstruse, but vain and foolish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, which philosophizes us out of the noblest parts of our noble nature.\n\nOne of those parts of us is our instinctive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, of which not one of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> which the philosophers most admire, and to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> they wish to reduce us, is found in the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to participate.\n\n\"Such philosophers may be called, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> sense, the enemies of mankind. They not only endeavour to entice man from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, but to rob him of a most excellent and natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. Such, surely, is the pleasure of devotion. For when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> rises above this little orb, and pours its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> at the throne of celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>, the holy fervour which it feels is itself a rapturous delight. Neither is this a declamatory representation, but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> and acknowledged by all the sons of men; except those who have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> in sensibility, or who hoped to gratify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> or the malignity of their hearts by singular and pernicious speculation.\n\n\"Indeed all disputatious, controversial, and metaphysical writings on the subject of religion, are unfavourable to genuine piety. We do not find that the most renowned polemics in the church militant were at all more attentive than others to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> offices of religion, or that they were actuated by any peculiar degree of devotion. The truth is, their religion centered in their heads, whereas its natural region is the heart. The heart! confined, alas! in colleges or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>, unacquainted with all the tender charities of husband, father, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, friend; some of them have almost forgotten that they possess a heart. It has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ceased to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> with the pulsations of love and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>, and has been engrossed by pride on conquering an adversary in the syllogistic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, or by impotent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> on a defeat. With such habits, and so defective a system of feelings, can we expect that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORBONNE\">Sorbonne</a>, or the disputing professor of divinity, should ever feel the pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of piety that glowed in the bosoms of Mrs Rowe, Mrs Talbot, or Mr Nellon?\n\n\"It is however certain, that a devotional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> are very desirable in themselves, exclusive of their effects in meliorating the morals and disposition, and promoting present and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> felicity. They add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, pleasure, and security to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>: but to old age they are the most becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, the most substantial support, and the sweetest comfort. In order to preserve them, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to preserve our sensibility; and nothing will contribute so much to this purpose as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, innocence, and simplicity.\"\n\nOf piety, as it denotes love and tenderness to our friends, there have been many distinguished instances both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">FILIAL</a> Piety, FRATERNAL and PARENTAL Affection, &c.\n\nThe following example of filial piety in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, taken from P.

He managed matters so well, that giving his keepers the slip, he fled to the house of Lou Nan-kin, with whom he had a friendship, and there hid himself. Lou Nan-kin, notwithstanding the strict search that was made, and the severity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> against those who conceal prisoners that have escaped, would not betray his friend. However, the thing coming to be discovered, Lou Nan-kin was imprisoned; and they were just on the point of proceeding against him, when his younger brother presenting himself before the judge, It is I, Sir, said he, who have hidden the prisoner; it is I who ought to die, and not my elder brother. The eldest maintained, on the contrary, that his younger brother accused himself wrongfully, and was not at all culpable. The judge, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> sagacity, fitted both parties to effectually, that he not only discovered that the younger brother was innocent, but even made him confess it himself: It is true, Sir, said the younger all in tears, I have accused myself falsely; but I have very strong reasons for so doing. My mother has been dead for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and her corpse is not yet buried; I have a sister also who is marriageable, but is not yet disposed of: these things which my brother is capable of managing, I am not, and therefore desire to die in his stead.

When persons shoot at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> kill pigeons within a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the pigeon-house, they are liable to pay a forfeiture.\n\nIn order to erect a pigeon-house to advantage, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, to pitch upon a convenient situation; of which none is more proper than the middle of a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>, because pigeons are naturally of a timorous disposition, and the least noise they hear frightens them. With regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the pigeon-house, it must depend entirely upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of birds intended to be kept; but it is better to have it too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> than too little; and as to its form, the round should be preferred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> ones; because rats cannot so easily come at them in the former as in the latter. It is also much more commodious; because you may, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, easily visit all the nests in the house, without the least difficulty; which cannot so easily be done in a square house. In order to hinder rats from climbing up the outside of the pigeon-house, the wall should be covered with tin plates to a certain height, about a foot and a half will be sufficient; but they should project out three or four inches at the top, to prevent their clambering any higher.\n\nThe pigeon-house should be placed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> distance from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, that the pigeons may carry it to their young ones; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> it in their bills will warm it, and render it more wholesome in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. The boards that cover the pigeon-house should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> joined together, so that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> may penetrate through it; and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> should be covered with hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>-washed within and without, white being the most pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to pigeons. There must be no window, or other opening in the pigeon-house to the eastward; these should always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the south, for pigeons are very fond of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, especially in winter.\n\nThe nests or covers in a pigeon-house should consist of square holes made in the walls, of a size sufficient to admit the cock and hen to stand in them. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of these nests should not be less than four feet from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, that the wall underneath being smooth, the rats may not be able to reach them. These nests should be placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUINCUNX\">quincunx</a> order, and not directly over one another. Nor must they be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> any higher than within three feet of the top of the wall; and the upper row should be covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, projecting a considerable distance from the wall, for fear the rats should find means to climb the outside of the house.\n\nM. Duhamel thinks that pigeons neither feed upon the green corn, nor have bills strong enough to search for its seeds in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; but only pick up the grains that are not covered, which would infallibly become the prey of other animals, or be dried up by the sun. \"From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the sprouting of the corn,\" says he, \"pigeons live chiefly upon the seeds of wild uncultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and therefore lessen considerably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of weeds that would otherwise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> up; as will appear from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> estimate of the quantity of grain necessary to feed all the pigeons of a well-stocked dove-house.\" But Mr Worlidge and Mr Litle allege facts in support of the contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. The latter relates, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> in his neighbourhood assured him he had known an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> sown with peas, and rain coming on so that they could not be harrowed in, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a> was fetched away in half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s time by pigeons; and the former says, \"It is to be observed, that where the flight of pigeons falls, there they fill themselves and away, and return again where they first rose, and so proceed over a whole piece of ground, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they like it. Although you cannot perceive any grain above the ground, they know how to find it. I have seen them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> so much upon a piece of about two or three acres sown with peas, that they devoured at least three parts in four of the seed, which, I am sure, could not be all above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the ground. That their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SMELLING\">smelling</a> is their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>, I have observed; having sown a small plot of peas in my garden, near a pigeon-house, and covered them so well that not a pea appeared above ground. In a few days, a parcel of pigeons were hard at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in discovering this hidden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>; and in a few days more I had not above two or three peas left out of about two quarts that were planted; for what they could not find before, they found when the buds appeared, notwithstanding they were hoed in, and well covered. Their smelling alone directed them, as I supposed, because they followed the ranges exactly. The injury they do at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> on the peas, vetches, &c. is such that we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> them among the greatest enemies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> husbandman meets withal; and the greater, because he may not erect a pigeon-house, whereby to have a share of his own spoils; none but the rich being allowed this privilege, and so severe a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> being also made to protect these winged thieves, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> cannot encounter them, even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. You have therefore no remedy against them, but to affright them away by noises or such like. You may, indeed, shoot at them; but you must not kill them; or you may, if you can, take them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>, cut off their tails, and let them go; by which means you will impound them; for when they are in their houses, they cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLT\">bolt</a> or fly out of the tops of them, but by the strength of their tails; after thus weakening of which, they remain prisoners at home.\"\n\nMr Worlidge's impounding the pigeons reminds us of a humorous story of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, who, upon a neighbouring farmer's complaining to him, that his pigeons were a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a> to his land, and did sad mischief to his corn, replied jokingly, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">Pound</a> them, if you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> them trespassing.\" The farmer, improving the hint, steeped a parcel of peas in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of coccinellus indicus, or some other intoxicating drug, and strewed them upon his grounds. The pigeons swallowed them, and soon remained motionless on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>: upon which the farmer threw a net over them, inclosed them in it, and carried\nried them to an empty barn, from whence he sent the gentleman word that he had followed his directions with regard to the pounding of his pigeons, and desired him to come and release them.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRIER\">Carrier</a>-Pigeon. See Carrier-Pigeon and Columba, Ornithology Index.\n\nPigeon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Francis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURATE\">curate</a> of St Peter du Regard, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of Bayeux, was one of the priests lately belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s house at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>. He was born in Lower Normandy, of honest and virtuous parents, and of a decent fortune. His inclinations early led him to embrace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> state, from which neither the solicitations of his friends, nor the prospect of a more ample fortune on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his elder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, could withdraw him. Several of his schoolfellows and masters, who are now resident in the king's house at Winchester, bear the most ample testimony to his affability, regularity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, and the sweetness of his disposition, during the whole course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. The sweetness of temper, in particular, was so remarkable, and so clearly depicted on his countenance, as to have gained him the esteem and affection of such of the inhabitants of Winchester as by any means had become acquainted with him. He was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a>, or, as we should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it, curate, of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> in the diocese of Seze, where his virtues and talents had ample scope for exertion. His practice was to rise at five o'clock every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and to spend the whole time till noon (the usual time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a> for persons in his station) in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the day, till evening, he devoted to visiting the sick, and other exterior duties of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. In 1789, the year of the French revolution, M. Pigeon was promoted to a curacy, or rather a rectory, in the diocese of Bayeux, called the parish of St Peter du Regard, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of Cond\u00e9 sur No\u00ebre. It was easy for him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the good-will and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of his parishioners; but a Jacobin club in the above-mentioned town seemed to have no other subject to deliberate upon than the various ways of harassing and persecuting M. Pigeon and certain other priests in the neighbourhood, who had from motives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> refused the famous civic oath. It would be tedious to relate the many cruelties which were at different times exercised upon him, and the imminent danger of losing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to which he was exposed, by the blows that were inflicted on him, by his being thrown into water, and being obliged to wander in woods and other solitary places, without any food or place to lay his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, in order to avoid his persecutors. We may form some judgement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of his persecutors from the following circumstance. Being disappointed on a particular occasion in the search they were making after M. Pigeon, with the view of amusing themselves with his sufferings, they made themselves amends by seizing his mother, a respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of 74 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and his two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>, whom they placed upon asses with their faces turned backwards, obliging them in derision to hold the tails of these animals. Thus they were conducted in pain and ignominy throughout the whole town of Cond\u00e9, for no other alleged crime except being the nearest relations of M. Pigeon. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> for transporting all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a> arrived; and this gentleman, with several others, after having been stripped of all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, was shipped from Port Belfin, and landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, where he was shortly after received into the establishment at Foxton, and, upon that being dissolved in order to make room for prisoners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, into the king's house at Winchester. Being of a studious turn, he was accustomed, as many of his brethren also were, to betake himself to the neighbouring lanes and thickets for the sake of greater solitude. With this view having, about ten o'clock in the morning, Aug. 28, 1793, retired to a certain little valley, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> side of a place called Oram's Arbour, the same place where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> elections for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a> are held, he was there found, between three and four o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, murdered, with the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his skull absolutely broken from the lower part, and a large hedge-stake, covered with blood, lying by him, as were the papers on which he had been transcribing a manuscript sermon, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> of which he had been much edified, and the sermon itself which he was copying, together with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, imbrued in blood. His watch was carried away, though part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>, which had by some means been broken, was left behind. He was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the word paradise, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> letters of which remained unwritten when the fatal blow was given him, which appears evidently to have been discharged upon him from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> in a hedge which was immediately behind him. At first the suspicion of this cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> fell upon the French democrats, who, to the number of 200, are prisoners of war, at the neighbouring town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALRESFORD\">Alresford</a>, as one of that number, who had broken his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAROLE\">parole</a>, had, about three weeks before, been taken up in Winchester, and both there and at Alresford had repeatedly threatened to murder his uncle, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, whom he understood to be then at Winchester, not without fervent wishes of having it in his power to murder the whole establishment, consisting of more than 600 persons. However, as no French prisoner was seen that day in the neighbourhood of Winchester, as none of them were known to have left Alresford, it is evidently reasonable to acquiesce in the verdict of the coroner; namely, that the murder was committed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> or persons unknown.

At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> an under gardener <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the fish seize the fifth. The old one fought him with their beaks, and with the assistance of the gardener, released it although he had got it under water. In the year 1765 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pike was caught in the river Ouse, which weighed upwards of 28 pounds, and was sold for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a>. On gutting the fish, a watch with a black ribbon and two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> seals were found in its stomach, which, by the maker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, &c. was found to belong to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who had been drowned about six weeks before. This fish breeds but once in a year, which is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>. It is found in almost all fresh waters; but is very different in goodness, according to the nature of the places where it lives. The finest pike are those which feed in clear rivers; those in ponds and meres are inferior, and the worst of all are those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEN\">fen</a> ditches. They are very plentiful in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> places, where the water is foul and coloured, and their food, such as frogs and the like, very plentiful, but very coarse; so that they grow large, but are yellowish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> bellied, and differ greatly from those which live in the clearer waters.\n\nThe fishermen have two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ways of catching the pike; by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEDGER\">ledger</a>, and by the walking-bait.\n\nThe ledger-bait is fixed in one certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and may continue while the angler is absent. This must be a live bait, a fish or frog; and among fish, the dace, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ROACH\">roach</a>, and gudgeon, are the best; of frogs, the only caution is to choose the largest and yellowest that can be met with. If the bait be a fish, the hook is to be stuck through the upper lip, and the line must be 14 yards at least in length; the other end of this is to be tied to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOUGH\">bough</a> of a tree, or to a stick driven into the ground near the pike's haunt, and all the line wound round a forked stick, except about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>. The bait will by this means keep playing so much under water, and the pike will soon lay hold of it.\n\nIf the bait be a frog, then the arming wire of the hook should be put in at the mouth, and out at the side; and with a needle and some strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, the hinder leg of one side is to be fastened by one flitch to the wire-arming of the hook. The pike will soon seize this, and must have line enough to give him leave to get to his haunt, and poach the bait.\n\nThe trolling for pike is a pleasant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> also of taking them: in this a dead bait serves, and none is so proper as a gudgeon.\n\nThis is to be pulled about in the water till the pike seizes it; and then it is to have line enough, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to swallow it: the hook is small for this sport, and has a smooth piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> fixed at its end to sink the bait; and the line is very long, and runs through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> at the end of the rod, which must not be too slender at top.\n\nThe art of feeding pike, so as to make them very fat, is the giving them eels; and without this it is not to be done under a very long time; otherwise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERCH\">perch</a>, while small, and their prickly fins tender, are the best food for them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BREAM\">Bream</a> put into a pike-pond are a very proper food: they will breed freely, and their young ones make excellent food for the pike, who will take care that they shall not increase over much. The numerous shoals of roaches and rudds, which are continually changing place, and often in floods get into the pike's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, are food for them for a long time.\n\nPike, when used to be fed by hand, will come up to the very shore, and take the food that is given them out of the fingers of the feeder. It is wonderful to see with what courage they will do this, after a while practising; and it is a very diverting fight when there are several of them nearly of the same size, to see what striving and fighting there will be for the best bits when they are thrown in. The most convenient place is near the mouth of the pond, and where there is about half a yard depth of water; for, by that means, the offal of the feedings will all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in one place, and the deep water.\nwill serve for a place to retire into and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> in, and will be always clean and in order.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">Carp</a> may be fed in the same manner as pike; and though by nature a fish as remarkably shy and timorous as the pike is bold and fearless, yet by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> they will come to take their food out of the person's hand; and will, like the pike, quarrel among one another for the nicest bits.\n\n**Pike**, in *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">War</a>*, an offensive weapon, consisting of a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a>, 12 or 14 feet long, with a flat steel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, pointed, called the *spear*. This weapon was long in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>; but now the bayonet, which is fixed on the muzzle of the firelock, is substituted in its stead. It is still used by some of the officers of infantry, under the name of *spontoon*. The Macedonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHALANX\">phalanx</a> was a battalion of pikemen. See PHALANX.\n\n**Pila marina**, or the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>*, in *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>*, is the name of a substance very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> on the shores of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and elsewhere. It is generally found in the form of a ball about the size of the balls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> dung, and composed of a variety of fibrils irregularly complicated. Various conjectures have been given of its origin by different authors. John Bauhine tells us, that it consists of small hairy fibres and straws, such as are found about the sea plant called *algae vivariarum*; but he does not ascertain what plant it owes its origin to. Imperatus imagined it consisted of the exuviae both of vegetable and animal bodies. Mercatus is doubtful whether it be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of the fibrils of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, wound up into a ball by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the sea water, or whether it be not the workmanship of some sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEETLE\">beetle</a> living about the sea shore, and analogous to our common dung beetle's ball, which it elaborates from dung for the reception of its progeny. Schreckius says it is composed of the filaments of some plant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a> kind; and Welchius supposes it is composed of the papous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of the reed. Maurice Hoffman thinks it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> of the hippopotamus; and others think it that of the phoca or sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>. Klein, who had thoroughly and minutely examined the bodies themselves, and all what authors had conjectured concerning them, thinks that they are wholly owing to, and entirely composed of, the calliaments which the leaves, growing to the woody stalk of the *algae vivariarum*, have when they wither and decay. These leaves, in their natural state, are as thick as a wheat straw, and they are placed so thick about the tops and extremities of the stalks, that they enfold, embrace, and lie over one another; and from the middle of these clusters of leaves, and indeed from the woody substance of the plant itself, there arise several other very long, flat, smooth, and brittle leaves. These are usually four from each tuft of the other leaves; and they have ever a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAGINA\">vagina</a>, which is membranaceous and very thin. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the plant, and the *pila marina* appears to be a cluster of the fibres of the leaves of this plant, which cover the whole stalk, divided into their constituent fibres; and by the motion of the waves first broken and worn into short threads, and afterwards wound up together into a roundish or lengthened ball.\n\n**Pila**, was a ball made in a different manner according to the different games in which it was to be used. Playing at ball was very common amongst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, and was looked upon as a manly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, which contributed both to amusement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. The pila was of four sorts: 1st, *Follis* or balloon; 2d, *Pila Trigonalis*; 3d, *Pila Paganica*; 4th, *Harpagium*. All these come under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> name of pila. For the manner of playing with each of them, see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> FOLLIS, TRIGONALIS.","sp":163,"ep":164},{"h":"PILASTER","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>.

Of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> we know but little, though it is believed that he was of Rome, or at least of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. He was sent to govern Judea in the room of Gratius, in the year 26 or 27 of the vulgar era, and governed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> for ten years, from the 12th or 13th year of Tiberius to the 22d or 23d. He is represented both by Philo and Josephus as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of an impetuous and obstinate temper, and as a judge who used to sell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and to pronounce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> that was desired, provided he was paid for it. The same authors make mention of his rapines, his injuries, his murders, the torments that he inflicted upon the innocent, and the persons he put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> without any form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. Philo, in particular, describes him as a man that exercised an excessive cruelty during the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, who disturbed the repose of Judea, and gave occasion to the troubles and revolt that followed after. St Luke (xiii. 1, 2, &c.) acquaints us, that Pilate had mingled the blood of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALILEANS\">Galileans</a> with their sacrifices; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> having been related to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, he said, \"Think you that these Galileans were greater sinners than other Galileans, because they suffered this calamity. I tell you nay; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> you do not repent, you shall all perish in like manner.\" It is unknown upon what occasion Pilate caused these Galileans to be slain in the temple while they were sacrificing; for this is the meaning of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of mingling their blood with their sacrifices. Some think they were disciples of Judas the Gaulonite, who taught that the Jews ought not to pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> to foreign princes; and that Pilate had put some of them to death even in the temple; but there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this fact. Others think that these Galileans were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a>, whom Pilate cut to pieces in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Tirataba, as they were preparing to go up to Mount Gerizim, where a certain Antig. lib. impolior had promised to discover treasures to them; but this event did not happen before the year 35 of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> era, and consequently two years after the death of Jesus Christ. At the time of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, Pilate made some endeavours to deliver him out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Jews. He knew they had delivered him up, and purified his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> with so much violence, only out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> and envy (Matt. xxvii. 18.). His wife also, who had been disturbed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> before with frightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, sent to tell him she desired him not to meddle in the affair of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> (ib. 19.). He attempted to appease the wrath of the Jews, and to give them some satisfaction, by whipping Jesus Christ (John xix. 1. Matt. xxvii. 26.). He tried to take him out of their hands, by proposing to deliver him or Barabbas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the festival of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a>. Lastly, he had a mind to discharge himself from pronouncing judgement against him, by sending him to Herod <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALILEE\">Galilee</a> (Luke xxiii. 7, 8.). When he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> all this would not satisfy the Jews, and that they even threatened him in some manner, saying he could be no friend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> if he let him go (John xix. 12, 15.), he caused\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to be brought, washed his hands before all the people, and publicly declared himself innocent of the blood of that just person (Matt. xxvii. 23, 24.); yet at the same time he delivered him up to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, that they might crucify him. This was enough to justify Jesus Christ, as Calmet observes, and to show that he held him as innocent; but it was not enough to vindicate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> and integrity of a judge, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> it was as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> to assert the cause of oppressed innocence as to punish the guilty and criminal. He ordered to be put over our Saviour's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, as it were, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of his sentence, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> (John xix. 9.), Jesus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAZARETH\">Nazareth</a>, king of the Jews, which was written in Latin, Greek, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>. Some of the Jews found fault with it, and remonstrated to Pilate that he ought to have written Jesus of Nazareth, who pretended to be king of the Jews. But Pilate could not be prevailed with to alter it, and gave them this peremptory answer, That what he had written he had written.\n\nTowards evening, he was applied to for leave to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the bodies from the cross, that they might not continue there the following day, which was the passover and the Sabbath-day (John xix. 31.). This he allowed, and granted the body of Jesus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> of Arimathea, that he might pay his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> duties to it, (ib. 33.). Lastly, when the priests, who had solicited the death of our Saviour, came to desire him to set a watch about the sepulchre, for fear his disciples should steal him away by night, he answered them, that they had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, and might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> them there themselves (Matt. xxvii. 65.). This is the substance of what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> tells us concerning Pilate.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-JUSTIN_MARTYR\">Justin <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>, Tertullian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUSEBIUS\">Eusebius</a>, and after them several others both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, assure us, that it was formerly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> for Roman magistrates to prepare copies of all verbal proceedings and judicial acts which they passed in their several provinces, and to send them to the emperor. And Pilate, in compliance to this custom, having sent word to Tiberius of what had passed relating to Jesus Christ, the emperor wrote an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, in a manner that gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to judge that he thought favourably of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of Jesus Christ, and showed that he should be willing they would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> honours to him. But the senate was not of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and so the matter was dropped. It appears by what Justin says of these acts, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> of Jesus Christ were mentioned there, and even that the soldiers had divided his garments among them. Eusebius intimates that they spoke of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a> and ascension. Tertullian and Justin refer to these acts with so much confidence as would make one believe they had them in their hands. However, neither Eusebius nor St Jerome, who were both inquisitive, understanding persons, nor any other author that wrote afterwards, seem to have seen them, at least not the true and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> acts; for as to what we have now in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, they are not authentic, being neither ancient nor uniform. There are also some pretended letters of Pilate to Tiberius, giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of our Saviour, but they are universally allowed to be spurious.\n\nPilate being a man that, by his excessive cruelties and rapine, had disturbed the peace of Judea during the whole time of his government, was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> deposed by Vitellius the proconsul of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, in the 36th year of Jesus Christ, and sent to Rome to give an account of his conduct to the emperor. But though Tiberius died before Pilate arrived at Rome, yet his successor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIGULA\">Caligula</a> banished him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VIENNE\">Vienne</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, where he was reduced to such extremity that he killed himself with his own hands. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVANGELISTS\">evangelists</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> him governor, though in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> he was no more than procurator of Judea, not only because governor was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, but because Pilate in effect acted as one, by taking upon him to judge in criminal matters; as his predecessors had done, and other procurators in the small provinces of the empire where there was no proconsul, constantly did. See Calmet's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>, Eckhard's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">Ecclesiastical</a> Dictionary, and Beaupr\u00e9's Annotations.\n\nWith regard to Pilate's wife, the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> is, that she was named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLAUDIA\">Claudia</a> Procula or Procula; and in relation to her dream, some are of opinion that she had intelligence of our Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, and knew by his character that he was a righteous person; her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, being struck with these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, did naturally produce the dream we read of; but others think that this dream was sent providentially upon her, for the clearer manifestation of our Lord's innocence.","sp":164,"ep":165},{"h":"PILATRE DU ROZIER","t":"French, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METZ\">Metz</a> the 30th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1756.

The scales of the pilchard adhere very closely, whereas those of the herring very easily drop off.

Their winter retreat is the same with that of the herring, and their motives for migrating the same. They affect, during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, a warmer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>; for they are not found in any quantities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> any of our coasts except those of Cornwall, that is to say, from Fowey harbour to the Scilly isles, between which places the shoals keep shifting for some weeks. The approach of the pilchard is known by much the same signs as those that indicate the arrival of the herring. Persons, called in Cornwall hurrs, are placed on the cliffs, to point to the boats stationed off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> the course of the fish.

In England, the shrine of St Thomas \u00e0 Becket was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of the pious; and in Scotland, St Andrews; where, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> informs us, was deposited a leg of the holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> they still continue; for, from the beginning of May till the middle of August every year, crowds of papish penitents from all parts of that country resort to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> near the centre of Lough-foo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Lake, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONEGAL\">Donegal</a>, to the amount of 3000 or 4000. These are mostly of the poorer sort, and many of them are proxies for those who are richer; some of which, however, together with some of the priests and bishops on occasion, make their appearance there. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIM\">pilgrim</a> comes within sight of the holy lake, he must uncover his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and feet, and thus walk to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-side, and is taken to the island for inspection. Here there are two chapels and 15 other houses; to which are added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSIONAL\">confessional</a>, so contrived, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> cannot see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> confessing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> varies according to the circumstances of the penitent; during the continuance of which (which is sometimes three, six, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> days) he subsists on oatmeal, sometimes made into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. He traverses sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> on his bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> or feet, and goes through a variety of other forms, paying inspection at every different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>. When all is over, the priest bores a gimblet-hole through the pilgrim's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> near the top, in which he fastens a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> peg; gives him as many holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a> out of the lake as he cares to carry away, for amulets to be presented to his friends, and so disposes him, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of veneration to all other papists not thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a>, who no sooner see the pilgrim's cross in his hands, than they kneel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to get his blessing.\n\nThere are, however, other parts of Ireland sacred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> and pilgrimage; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, and miraculous cures, &c., produced by them, is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>. That such things should exist in this enlightened age, and in a Protestant country, is indeed strange; but our wonder ceases, when we reflect that it is among the lowest; and perhaps the worst of the people.

We do not deny, however, that they who carry matters to the other extreme, may be equally destitute of real knowledge and genuine morality.\n\nDr Johnson, in his Rasselas, gives us some observations on pilgrimage, which are so much to the purpose, that we think we cannot do better than lay them before our readers. \"Pilgrimage (said Imalac, into whose mouth the observations are put), like many other acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, may be reasonable or superstitious according to the principles upon which it is performed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> journeys in search of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> are not commanded.

Yet since men go every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to view the fields where great actions have been performed, and return with stronger impressions of the event, curiosity of the same kind may naturally dispose us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning: and I believe no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> surveys those awful scenes without some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of holy resolutions. That the Supreme Being may be more easily propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>; but that some places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which hourly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> justify.

It is pretended that it acts as its pilot. The manner in which it attends the shark, according to M. Daubenton, may have given rise to this name. It is said to swim at the height of a foot and a half from the snout of this voracious animal, to follow and imitate all its movements, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of its prey which the shark allows to escape, and which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUOY\">buoy</a> up towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the water. When the shark, which has its mouth below, turns to seize any fish, the pilot-fish starts away; but as soon as the shark resumes his ordinary position, it returns to its former place.

At the end of two years it will be proper to give the land a thorough cleaning, leaving such only of the pimento trees as have a good appearance, which will then soon form such groves as those I have described, and, except perhaps for the first four or five years, require very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> afterwards.\n\nSoon after the trees are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOSSOM\">blossom</a>, the berries become fit for gathering; the fruit not being suffered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> on the tree, as the pulp in that state, being moist and glutinous, is difficult to cure, and when dry becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and tasteless. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, however, to prevent some of the ripe berries from mixing with the refuse; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of them be great, the price of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> is considerably injured.\n\nIt is gathered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; one labourer on the tree, employed in gathering the small branches, will give employment to three below (who are generally women and children) in picking the berries; and an industrious picker will fill a bag of 70 lbs. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe returns from a pimento walk in a favourable season are prodigious. A single tree has been known to yield 150 lbs. of the raw fruit, or one cwt. of the dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPICE\">spice</a>; there being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of one third in curing; but this, like many other of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> productions, is exceedingly uncertain, and perhaps a very plentiful crop occurs but once in five years.\"","sp":172,"ep":173},{"h":"PIMPINELLA","t":"Burnet Saxifrage; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the pentandria <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>.

We shall therefore give our readers an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it from Ellis's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAGNA\">Campagna</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\nWhen the brass-wire, of which the pins are formed, is first received at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a>, it is generally too thick for the purpose of being cut into pins. The first operation therefore is that of winding it off from one wheel to another with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, and causing it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> between the two, through a circle in a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> of smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>: the wire, being thus reduced to its proper dimensions, is strained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it between iron pins fixed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> in a zig-zag manner, but so as to leave a straight line between them: afterwards it is cut into lengths of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> four yards, and then into smaller ones, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> being sufficient to make six pins; each end of these is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> to a point, which was performed when I viewed the factory by boys who sat each with two small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> before him, turned by a wheel. Taking up a handful, he applies the ends to the coarsest of the two stones, being careful at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to keep each piece moving round between his fingers, so that the points may not become flat: he then gives them a smoother and sharper point, by applying them to the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and by that means a lad of 12 or 14 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> is enabled to point about 16,000 pins in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. When the wire is thus pointed, a pin is taken off from each end, and this is repeated till it is cut into six pieces. The next operation is that of forming the heads, or, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>; which is done by means of a spinning-wheel, one piece of wire being thus with astonishing rapidity wound round another, and the interior one being drawn out, leaves a hollow tube between the circumvolutions: it is then cut with shears; every two circumvolutions or turns of the wire forming one head; these are softened by throwing them into iron pans, and placing them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> till they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot.

He received his first musical instructions from his father, who was a flutist-player by profession; after which, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIDAS\">Suidas</a>, he was placed under Myrtilis, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of distinguished abilities in lyric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>. It was during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> that he became acquainted with the poetess Corinna, who was likewise a student under Myrtilis. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a> tells us, that Pindar profited from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> which Corinna, more advanced in her studies, gave him at this school. It is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to suppose, that the first poetical effusions of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> so full of fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> as that of Pindar would be wild and luxuriant; and Lucian has preserved five verses, said to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXORDIUM\">exordium</a> of his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>; in which he crowded almost all the subjects for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a> then furnished. Upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> this attempt to Corinna, she told him smiling, that he should fow with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and not empty his whole flask at once. Pindar, however, soon quitted Pindar, the leading strings of these ladies, his poetical nurture, and became the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIMONIDES\">Simonides</a>, now arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>: after which he soon surpassed all his masters, and acquired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> reputation over all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; but, like a true prophet, he was less honoured in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> than elsewhere; for at Thebes he was frequently pronounced to be vanquished, in the musical and poetical contests, by candidates of inferior merit.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of having these public trials of skill in all the great cities of Greece was now so prevalent, that but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> was to be acquired by a musician <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> poet any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> than by entering the lists; and we find, that both Myrtilis and Corinna publicly disputed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> with him at Thebes. He obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> over Myrtilis, but was vanquished five different times by Corinna. The judges, upon occasions like these, have been frequently accused of partiality or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, not only by the vanquished, but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the merit of Pindar was pronounced inferior to that of Corinna five several times, it was, says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAUSANIAS\">Pausanias</a>, because the judges were more sensible to the charms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> than to those of music and poetry (a). Was it not strange, said the Scythian Anacharsis, that the Grecian artists were never judged by artists, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a>?\n\nPindar, before he quitted Thebes, had the vexation to see his Dithyrambics traduced, abused, and turned into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, by the comic poets of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; and Athenaeus tells us, that he was feverishly censured by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> lyrics, for being a lipogrammatist, and composing an ode from which he had excommunicated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> S. Whether these censures proceeded from envy or contempt cannot now be determined; but they were certainly useful to Pindar, and it was necessary that he should be lauded for such puerilities. Thebes seems to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATORY\">purgatory</a> of our young bard: when he quitted that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, as his judgement was matured, he avoided most of the errors for which he had been chastised, and suddenly became the wonder and delight of all Greece. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, prince, and potentate, deafuous of lasting fame, courted the muse of Pindar.\n\nHe seems frequently to have been present at the four great festivals, of the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games, as may be inferred from several circumstances and expressions in the odes which he composed for the victors in them all. Those at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIA\">Olympia</a>, who were ambitious of having their achievements celebrated by Pindar, applied to him for an ode, which was first sung in the Prytaneum or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of Olympia, where there was a banqueting-room, set apart for the entertainment of the conquerors. Here the ode was rehearsed by a chorus, accompanied by instruments. It was afterwards performed in the same manner at the triumphal entry of the victor into his own country, in processions, or at the sacrifices that were made with great pomp and solemnity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the occasion.\n\n(a) Pausanias says, that Corinna was one of the most beautiful women of her time, as he judged by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of her which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> at Tanagris at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the public exercises were performed. She was represented with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> ornamented by a ribbon, as a memorial of the victories she had obtained over Pindar at Thebes.\nPindar, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Isthmian ode, has apologized for the mercenary custom among poets, of receiving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> for their compositions. \"The world (says he) is grown interested, and thinks in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> with the Spartan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> Aristostratus, that money only makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> which this sage himself experienced, having with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> lost all his friends.\" It is supposed that Pindar here alludes to the avarice of Simonides, who first allowed his muse to sell her favours to the highest bidder.\n\nThere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great poet in antiquity whose moral character has been less censured than that of Pindar. Plutarch has preferred a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of his Epicedium or Dirge that was sung at his funeral; which, short and simple as it is, implies great praise: This man was pleasing to strangers, and dear to his fellow-citizens. His works abound with precepts of the purest morality: and it does not appear that he ever traduced even his enemies; comforting himself, for their malignity, by a maxim which he inserted in his first Pythic, and which afterwards became proverbial, That it is better to be envied than pitied.\n\nPaulanias says, that the character of poet was truly consecrated, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of Pindar, by the god of verse himself; who was pleased, by an express oracle, to order the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a> to set apart for Pindar one half of the first-fruit offerings brought by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> to his shrine, and to allow him a conspicuous place in his temple, where, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, he used to sit and sing his hymns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of that god. This chair was remaining in the time of Paulanias, several centuries after, and shown to him as a relic not unworthy of the sanctity and magnificence of that place.\n\nBut though Pindar's muse was patronized at Delphi, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> paid by princes and potentates elsewhere, she seems, however, sometimes to have sung the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> strains of pure friendship. Of this kind were, probably, the verses bestowed upon the musician <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDAS\">Midas</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRIGENTUM\">Agrigentum</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, who had twice obtained the palm of victory by his performance on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a> at the Pythic games (b). It is in his 12th Pythic ode that Pindar celebrates the victory of Midas over all Greece, upon that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> herself had invented (c).\n\nFabricius tells us, that Pindar lived to the age of 90; and, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a> of Dr Blair, he died 435 years B.C. aged 86. His fellow citizens erected a monument to him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPODROME\">Hippodrome</a> at Thebes, which was still subsisting in the time of Paulanias; and his renown was so great after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, that his posterity derived very considerable honours and privileges from it. When Alexander the Great attacked the city of Thebes, he gave express orders to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> to spare the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Pindar. The Lacedemonians had done the same before this period; for when they ravaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a> and burned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, the following words were written upon the door of the poet: Forbear to burn this house, it was the dwelling of Pindar.

In the epistle dedicatory, he affirms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of a declared enemy to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Rome.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>. The pine-tree was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and has been described and celebrated both by their philosophers and poets. Pliny enumerates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of trees of this genus; and it is mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> both in his Eclogues, his Georgics, and his Aeneid; by Horace in his Odes; by Ovid in his Metamorphoses; by Statius; and by Catullus, &c.

When he entertained them with gladiators, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> himself from such treatment for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a>, he procured an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> from the ediles, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> should throw any thing but apples in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>.

Lib. xiii.\n\nThere are generally reckoned 14 species of this genus; of which the most remarkable are these following:\n\n1. The pinea, pineager, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> wild pine, grows naturally on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and the south of France. It grows to the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tree; the branches extend to a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>; and while the trees are young, they are fully furnished with leaves, especially where they are not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> as to exclude the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from those within; but as they advance in age, the branches appear naked, and all those which are situated below become unfruitful in a few years; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> they are now much less in esteem than formerly.\n\n2. The pinus pin\u00e6a, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> pine, is a tall evergreen tree, native of Italy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. It delights in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> loam, though like most others it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> grow well in almost any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. Respecting the uses of this species, Hanbury tells us that \"the kernels are eatable, and by many preferred to almonds. In Italy they are served up at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> in their shells.\"\u2014They are exceeding wholesome, being good for coughs, colds, consumptions, &c. on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> only this tree deserves to be propagated.\" Hanbury continues: \"It may be very proper here to take notice of a very great and dangerous mistake Mr Miller has committed, by saying, under this article of stone-pine, that seeds kept in the cones will be good, and grow if they are sown ten or twelve years after the cones have been gathered from the trees; whereas the seeds of this sort, whether kept in the cones or taken out, are never good after the first year; and though sometimes a few plants will come up from the seeds that are kept in the cones for two years before, yet this is but seldom; neither must a tenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a crop be expected. This caution is the more necessary, as several gentlemen who had cones, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> Mr Miller's book, and finding the seeds would take no damage when kept there, deferred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> for a season or two, when they thought they should have more conveniency either of men or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for their purpose; and were afterwards wholly disappointed, no plants appearing,\"\npearing, the seeds being by that time spoiled and worth nothing.\"\n\n3. The rubra, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called the Scots fir or pine. It is common throughout Scotland, whence its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>; though it is also found in most of the other countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. M. du Hamel, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences, mentions his having received some seeds of it from St Domingo in the West Indies; and thence concludes, that it grows indifferently in the temperate, frigid, and torrid zones. The wood of this tree is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, which is the most durable of any of the kinds yet known. The leaves of this tree are much shorter and broader than those of the former sort, of a grayish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, growing two out of one fleath; the cones are small, pyramidal, and end in narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>; they are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> colour, and the seeds are small.\n\n4. The pinus picea, or yew-leaved fir, is a tall evergreen, and a native of Scotland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, and Germany. This species includes the silver fir and the balm of Gilead fir. The first of these is a noble upright tree. Mr. Marshall says, \"The tallest trees I have seen were spruce and silver firs in the valleys in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> several firs in the dockyards in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> 40 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>; and one of 39 yards was 18 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> at the small end. I was told they came from Switzerland.\"\n\nThe branches are not very numerous, and the bark is smooth and delicate. The leaves grow singly on the branches, and their ends are slightly indented. Their upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> is of a fine strong green colour, and their under has an ornament of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> running lengthwise on each side the midrib; on account of which silvery look this sort is called the silver fir. The cones are large, and grow erect; and when the warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> comes on, they soon shed their seeds; which should be a caution to all who wish to raise this plant, to gather the cones before that happens.\n\nThe balm of Gilead fir has of all the sorts been most coveted, on account of the great fragrance of its leaves; though this is not its only good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>: for it is a very beautiful tree, naturally of an upright growth, and the branches are so ornamented with their balmy leaves, as to exceed any of the other sorts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. The leaves, which are very closely set on the branches, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>; and their ends are indented. Their upper surface, when healthy, is of a fine dark-green colour, and their under has white lines on each side the midrib lengthwise, nearly like those of the silver fir. These leaves when bruised are very finely scented; and the buds, which swell in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> for the next year's shoot, are very ornamental all winter, being turgid, and of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour: and from these also exudes a kind of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, of the same kind of (though heightened) fragrancy. The tree being wounded in any part, emits plenty of this turpentine; and Hanbury says, \"it is supposed by many to be the sort from whence the balm of Gilead is taken, which occasions this tree being so called. But this is a mistake; for the true balm of Gilead is taken from a kind of terebinth: though I am informed, that what has been collected from this tree has been sent over to England from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> (where it grows naturally), and often sold in the shops for the true sort.\"\n\nThe silver fir is very hardy, and will grow in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> or situation, but always makes the greatest progress in rich loamy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The balm of Gilead fir must be planted in deep, rich, good earth; nor will it live long in any other. The soil may be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mould, or of a sandy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, if it be deep enough, and if the roots have room enough to strike freely.\n\n5. The pinus abies, or European spruce fir, a native of the northern parts of Europe and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, includes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a> spruce and long-coned Cornish fir. The former of these is a tree of as much beauty while growing as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> is valuable when propagated on that account. Its growth is naturally like the silver, upright; and the height it will attain to may be easily conceived, when we say that the white deal, so much coveted by the joiners, &c., is the wood of this tree; and it may perhaps satisfy the curious reader to know, that from this fir pitch is drawn. The leaves are of a dark-green colour; they stand singly on the branches, but the younger shoots are very closely garnished with them. They are very narrow; their ends are pointed; and they are peopled of such beauties as to excite admiration. The cones are eight or ten inches long, and hang downwards.\n\nThe better the soil is, the faster will the spruce fir grow, though it will thrive very well in most of our English lands. In strong loamy earth it makes a surprising progress; and it delights in fresh land of all sorts, which never has been worn out by ploughing, &c., though it be ever so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. The long-coned Cornish fir differs scarcely in any respect from the Norway spruce, except that the leaves and the cones are larger.\n\n6. The pinus Canadensis, American or Newfoundland spruce fir, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, and other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> America, includes three varieties. The white Newfoundland spruce, the red Newfoundland spruce, and the black Newfoundland spruce. These, however, differ so little, that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is common to them all. They are of a gentle upright growth, though they do not float so freely or grow so fast with us as the Norway spruce. The leaves are of the same green, and garnish the branches in the same beautiful manner as those of that species; only they are narrower, shorter, and stand closer. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is observable in the cones; for these are no more than about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and the scales are closely placed. In the cones, indeed, consists the difference of these three sorts: those of the white species are of a very light brown colour; those of the red species more of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>-brown or reddish colour; and those of the black species of a dark or blackish colour. Besides this, there is scarcely any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> difference; though it is observable, that this trifling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> seems to be pretty constant in the plants raised from the like seeds. These sorts will often flower, and produce cones when only about five or six feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; and indeed look then very beautiful: but this is a sign of weaknesses in the plant, which it does not often fairly get over.\n\n7. The pinus balsamea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a> fir, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a> and Canada, possesses as little beauty as any of the fir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>; though, being rather scarce in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, it is deemed valuable. It is called by some the yew-leaved fir, from the resemblance of the leaves to those of the yew-tree. It is a tree of low growth, with but few branches; and these are long and slender, and spread abroad without order. The leaves do not garnish the branches...\nPinus branches so plentifully as those of any other sort of fir. The cones are very small and rounded; they are about half an inch long; and the scales are loosely arranged. We receive these cones from America, by which we raise the plants; though this caution should be given to the planter, that this tree is fond of moist rich ground, and in such a kind of soil will make the greatest progress.\n\n8. The *pinus orientalis*, or oriental fir, a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a>, is a low but elegant tree. The leaves are very short, and nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. The fruit is exceeding small, and hangs downward; and the whole tree makes an agreeable variety with the other kinds.\n\n9. The *abies* <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Weymouth's pine, or North American white pine. This grows sometimes to the height of 100 feet and upwards, and is highly valued on account of its beauty. The bark of the tree is very smooth and delicate, especially when young; the leaves are long and slender, five growing out of one sheath; the branches are pretty closely garnished with them, and thus make a fine appearance. The cones are long, slender, and very loose, opening with the first warmth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>; so that if they are not gathered in winter, the scales open and let out the seeds. The wood of this sort is esteemed for making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a> for ships. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>'s time there was a law made for the preservation of these trees, and for the encouragement of their growth in America. Within these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> 50 years they have been propagated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> in considerable plenty.\n\nWith respect to the culture of this species, Mr Hanbury, after some more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> directions, continues thus, \"I have known gentlemen, who, in attempting to raise these trees, have seen the young plants go off without perceiving the cause; and the more watering and pains they have taken, have found the plants perish in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> more and more, to their great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> and afflamentment. In the spring following these plants should be pricked out in beds half a foot under each way; and here they may stand two years, when they may be either finally planted out, or removed into the nursery, at the distance of one foot under, and two feet in the rows. If care has been taken of them in the nursery, they may be removed at a considerable height with great assurance of success: for it is much easier to make this pine grow than any of the other sorts: so that where they are wanted for ornament in parks, open places, &c., a show of them may be made in a little time.\n\n\"The soil the Weymouth pine delights in most is a sandy loam; but it likes other soils of an inferior nature: and although it is not generally to be planted on all lands like the Scotch fir, yet I have seen it luxuriant and healthy, making strong shoots, on blue and red clays, and other sorts of strong ground. On stony and flat ground, likewise, I have seen some very fine trees; so that I believe whoever is desirous of having plantations of this pine, need not be curious in the choice of his ground.\"\n\n10. The *pinus taeda*, or swamp-pine, is a tall evergreen tree, a native of the swamps of Virginia and Canada. There are several varieties of this genus which Hanbury enumerates and describes: such as, 1st, The three-leaved American swamp-pine. 2d, The two-leaved American pine. 3d, The yellow American pine, the yellow tough pine, and the tough pine of the plains; among which there is but little variety. 4th, The battard pine. 5th, The frankincense pine. And 6th, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a> pine.\n\n\"There are (continues our author) many other sorts of American pines, which we receive from thence with the like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANT\">cant</a> names of those of the above, which I have chosen to retain, as they will probably be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be sent over; and that the gardener receiving them as such may best know what to do with them. In many of those sorts I see at present no material difference; so I am induced to think they are the same, sent over with different names. Some of the sorts above-mentioned differ in very few respects; but I have chosen to mention them, as a pedon may be supplied with the seeds from Pennsylvania, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>, Virginia, Carolina, &c., where they all grow naturally; and having once obtained the seeds, and from them plants, they will become pleasing objects of his nicest observations.\"\n\n11. The *pinus cedrus*, ranked by Tournefort and others under larix, famous for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, is that popularly called by us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a> of Lebanon, by the ancients *cedrus magna* or the great cedar; also *cedrela*, *cedrata*; and sometimes the Phoenician or Syrian cedar, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where it grows in its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. It is a coniferous evergreen, of the biggest sort, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> large roundish cones of smooth scales, standing erect, the leaves being small, narrow, and thick set.\u2014They sometimes counterfeit cedar, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> wood of a reddish hue: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> discovers the cheat, that of true cedar being very aromatic. In some places, the wood of the cajou-tree passes under the name of cedar, on account of its reddish colour and its aromatic smell, which somewhat resemble that of fantal. Cedar-wood is reputed almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> and incorruptible; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> which it owes chiefly to its bitter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> cannot endure. For this reason it was that the ancients used cedar tablets to write upon, especially for things of importance, as appears from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of Periurus, *Et cedra ligna locuitur*. A juice was also drawn from cedar, with which they smeared their books and writings, or other matters, to preserve them from rotting; which is alluded to by Horace: by means of which it was, that Numa's books, written on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPYRUS\">papyrus</a>, were preserved entire to the year 535, as we are informed by Pliny.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>'s temple, as well as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, were both of this wood. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Hiram several cities for the cedars he had furnished him on these occasions. Cortes is said to have erected a palace at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, in which were 7000 beams of cedar, most of them 120 feet long, and 12 in circumference, as we are informed by Herrera. Some tell us of a cedar felled in Cyprus 130 feet long, and 18 in diameter. It was used for the main-mast in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLEY\">galley</a> of King Demetrius. Le Bruyn affirms us, that the two biggest he saw on Mount Lebanon, measured, one of them 57 palms, and the other 47, in circumference. In the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> at Utiaca, there were cedar trees near 2000 years old; which yet were nothing to that beam in an oratory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> at Seguntum in Spain, said to have been brought thither 2000 years before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>. Cedar is of so dry a nature, that it will not endure to be fastened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, from which it usually shrinks; so that they commonly fasten it with pins of the same wood.\"\nThe statue (says Hanbury) of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> at Ephesus was made of this material; and, if this tree abounded with us in great plenty, it might have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> share in our most superb edifices. The ethereal constantly emitted from its wood are said to purify the air, and make rooms wholesome. Chapels and places set apart for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> duties, being wainscoted with this wood, inspire the worshippers with a more solemn awe. It is not obnoxious to worms; and emits an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> which will preserve cloth or books from worms or corruption. The sawdust will preserve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> bodies from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>; and is therefore said to be plentifully used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBALMING\">embalming</a>, where practised.\n\nIt is remarkable that this tree is not to be found as a native in any other part of the world than Mount Libanus, as far as hath yet been discovered. What we find mentioned in Scripture of the lofty cedars can nowise applicable to the common growth of this tree; since, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> we have of those now growing in England, as also from the testimony of several travellers who have visited those few remaining trees on Mount Libanus, they are not inclined to grow very lofty, but on the contrary extend their branches very far; to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PSALMIST\">Psalmist</a> agrees very well, when he is describing the flourishing state of a people, and says, \"They shall spread their branches like the cedar-tree.\"\n\nRauwolf, in his Travels, says, there were not at that time (i.e. anno 1574) upon Mount Libanus more than 26 trees remaining, 24 of which stood in a circle; and the other two, which stood at a small distance, had their branches almost confused with age; nor could he find any younger tree coming up to succeed them, though he looked about diligently for some. These trees (he says) were growing at the foot of a small hill, on the top of the mountains, and amongst the snow. Those having very large branches, commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the tree to one side, but are extended to a great length, and in so delicate and pleasant order, as if they were trimmed and made even with great diligence, by which they are easily distinguished, at a great distance, from fir-trees. The leaves (continues he) are very like to those of the larch-tree, growing close together in little branches upon small brown thorns.\n\nMaundrel, in his Travels, says, there were but 16 large trees remaining when he visited the mountain, some of which were of a prodigious bulk, but that there were many more young ones of a smaller size: he measured one of the largest, and found it to be 12 yards six inches in girth, and yet found, and 37 yards in the spread of its boughs. At about five or six yards from the ground it was divided into five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, each of which was equal to a great tree. What Maundrel hath related was confirmed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who was there in the year 1722, with this difference only, viz. in the directions of the branches of the largest tree, which he measured, and found to be 22 yards diameter. Now, whether Mr Maundrel meant 37 yards in circumference of the spreading branches, or the diameter of them, cannot be determined by his words; yet either of them well agrees with this last account.\n\nThere is another species, viz. the larch tree, which the old botanists ranked under larix, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECIDUOUS\">deciduous</a> leaves, and oval obtuse cones. It grows naturally upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APENNINES\">Apennines</a>, and of late has been very much propagated in Britain. It is of quick growth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> rises to 50 feet or more; the branches are slender, their ends generally hanging downward, and are garnished with long narrow leaves which arise in clusters from one point, spreading open above like the hairs of a painter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>; they are of a light green, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> away in autumn. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> appear, which are disposed in form of small cones; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> flowers are collected into oval obtuse cones, which in some species have bright purple tops, and in others they are white; these differences are accidental; the cones are about an inch long, obtuse at their points; the scales are smooth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> over each other; under each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> there are generally lodged two seeds, which have wings. There are other two varieties of this tree, one of which is a native of America, and the other of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>. The cones of the American kind which have been brought to Britain seem in general to be larger than those of the common sort.\n\nMany encomiums (says Hanbury when speaking of this species) have been bestowed on the timber of the larch; and we find such a favourable account of it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors, as should induce us to think it would be proper for almost any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Evelyn recites a story of Witten, a Dutch writer, that a ship built of this timber and cypress had been found in the Numidian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, twelve fathoms under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and entire, and reduced to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> as to resist the sharpest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOOL\">tool</a>, after it had lain submerged above 1490 years. Certain it is this is an excellent wood for ship and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. At Venice this wood is frequently used in building their houses, as well as in Switzerland, where these trees abound; so that, without all doubt, the larch excels for masts for ships, or beams for houses, doors, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a>, &c., particularly as it is said to resist the worm.\n\nIn Switzerland (A) their houses are covered with boards of this wood cut out a foot square; and, as it emits a resinous substance, it so diffuses itself into every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> and crevice, and becomes so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> and close, as well as so hardened by the air, as to render the covering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> against all weather. But, as such covering for houses would cause great devastation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of fire, the buildings\n\n(A) \"Between Bex and Bevieux (says Coxe in his Travels in Switzerland), I observed the larch in great plenty. Painters, from the time of Pliny to that of Raphael, trusted their works to this wood, which the Roman naturalist titles immortale lignum. The wood is reckoned excellent for all works which are to lie under water; and the borderers on the lake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a> prefer it for building their vessels. In these parts I saw most beautiful woods of chestnut. Haller says that they extend some leagues; he also informs us, that they are found in other parts of Switzerland, and even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> places in some of the transalpine parts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">Accident</a> must have brought them thither, as it appears from Pliny that these trees were first introduced into Europe from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDIS\">Sardis</a>.\"\nbuildings are confined to a limited distance by an order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> from the magistrates. The wood when first laid on the houses, is said to be very white; but this colour, in two or three years is changed, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, to a black, which appears like a smooth shining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>.\"\n\nOf the common larch there are several varieties. The flowers which the commonest sort exhibits early in the spring are of a delicate red colour; another sort produces white flowers at the same season, and these have a delightful effect among those of the red sort; whilst another, called the Black Newfoundland larix, increases the variety, though by an aspect little differing from the others. There are also larches with greenish flowers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> red, &c., all of which are accidental varieties from seeds. These varieties are easily distinguished, even when out of blow: the young shoots of the white-flowering larch are of the lightest green, and the cones when ripe are nearly white. The red flowering larch has its shoots of a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, and the cones are of a brown colour; whilst the cones and shoots of the black Newfoundland larch are in the same manner proportionally tinged. The cones, which are a very great ornament to several sorts of the pines, are very little to these. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> beauty consists in the manner of their growth, the nature and beauty of their pencilled leaves and fair flowers; for the cones that succeed them are small, of a whitish, a reddish, or a blackish-brown colour, and make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>.\n\nThe pinus cedrus and pinus larix are propagated by sowing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of light earth exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> sun. The seed must be covered half an inch thick with fine light earth, and the beds watered at times when the weather is dry. In about six weeks the plants will appear; they must at this time be carefully guarded from the birds, shaded from the sun and winds, and kept very clear of weeds. In the latter end of April the following year, they may be removed into beds of fresh earth, placing them at ten inches distance every way. They are to be kept here two years, and such of them as seem to bend must be tied up to a stake to keep them upright. They may afterwards be planted in the places where they are to remain. They thrive well on the sides of barren hills, and make a very pretty figure there.\n\nRespecting the uses of this tree, Dr Pallas, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORA\">Flora</a> Rossica, informs us, that if it is burnt, and the wood consumed, the internal part of the wood distils copiously a drying reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, a little less glutinous than gum arabic, somewhat of a resinous taste, but wholly soluble in water. At the instigation of M. Kinder, this gum has lately been sold in the Russian shops under the name of gummi Orenburgensis, but which our author thinks should be called gummi Uraliensis or laricii. It is eaten by the Wogulis as a dainty, and is said to be nutritious and antiseptic. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> was gathered from the green leaves, but it could never be condensed. The Russians use the boletus laricius as an emetic in intermittents, and to check the leucorrhea. At Bafchir and Siberia the inhabitants sprinkle the dry powder on the wounds of oxen and horses, as a detergent and anthelmintic. The nuts of the pinus cembra, the same author affirms, are eaten as luxuries in Russia, and are even exported with the same view. The unripe cones give a very fragrant oil, termed balsamic. The inhabitants of Siberia use the tender tops, and even the bark rubbed off in the spring, as an antiseptic. The kernels of the nuts of the amygdalus nana give a very pleasing flavour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a>; and, when pressed, afford a bitter oil in large quantities. The way of destroying the bitter is by digesting it in the sun with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine, and it then becomes sweet and extremely agreeable.\n\nFrom the larch-tree is extracted what is erroneously called Venice turpentine. This substance, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> balsam, flows at first without incision; when it has done dropping, the poor people who wait in the fir woods make incisions at about two or three feet from the ground into the trunks of the trees, into which they fix narrow troughs about 20 inches long. The end of these troughs is hollowed like a ladle; and in the middle is a small hole bored for the turpentine to run into the receiver which is placed below it. As the gummy substance runs from the trees, it passes along the sloping gutter or trough to the ladle, and from thence runs through the holes into the receiver. The people who gather it visit the trees morning and evening from the end of May to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the turpentine out of the receivers. When it flows out of the tree, Venice turpentine is clear like water, and of a yellowish white; but, as it grows older, it thickens and becomes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CITRON\">citron</a> colour. It is procured in the greatest abundance in the neighbourhood of Lyons, and in the valley of St Martin near St Lucern in Switzerland.\n\nThough we have already noticed the manner of cultivating some of the particular species of this genus, and have also remarked the uses of some of them, we shall finish the article with a few general observations on the culture and uses of the whole.\n\nCulture. All the sorts of pines are propagated by seeds produced in hard woody cones. The way to get the seeds out of these cones is to lay them before a gentle fire, which will cause the cells to open, and then the seeds may be easily taken out. If the cones are kept entire, the seeds will remain good for some years; so that the surest way of preserving them is to let them remain in the cones till the time for sowing the seeds. If the cones are kept in a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, they will open and emit the seeds; but if they are not exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, they will remain close for a long time. The best season for sowing the pines is about the end of March. When the seeds are sown, the place should be covered with nets to keep off the birds; otherwise, when the plants begin to appear with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HULK\">hulk</a> of the seed on the top of them, the birds will peck off the tops, and thus destroy them.\n\nUses. From the first species is extracted the common turpentine, much used by farriers, and from which is drawn the oil of that name. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of making pitch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAR\">tar</a>, resin, and turpentine, from these trees, is very familiar. In the spring time, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> is most free in running, they pare off the bark of the pine tree, to make the sap run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into a hole which they cut at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> to receive it. In the way, as it runs down, it leaves a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREAM\">cream</a>, but a little thicker. This is very different from all the kinds of resin and turpentine in use, and it is generally sold to be used in the making of flamb\u00e9aux instead of white bees wax. The matter that is received in the hole at the bottom is taken up with ladles, and put in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>. A great part of this immediately runs through, and this is the com-\nmon turpentine. This is received into stone or earthen pots, and is ready for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. The thicker matter, which remains in the basket, they put into a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEMBIC\">alembic</a>, adding a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water. They distil this as long as any oil is seen floating upon the water. This oil they separate from the surface in large quantities, and this is the common oil or spirit of turpentine. The remaining matter at the bottom of the still is common yellow resin. When they have thus obtained all that they can from the sap of the tree, they cut it down, and hewing the wood into billets, they fill a pit dug in the earth with these billets, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> them on fire, there runs from them, while they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, a black thick matter. This naturally falls to the bottom of the pit, and this is the tar. The top of the pit is covered with tiles, to keep in the heat; and there is at the bottom a little hole, out of which the tar runs like oil. If this hole be made too large, it sets the whole quantity of the tar on fire; but, if small enough, it runs quietly out.\n\nThe tar, being thus made, is put up in barrels; and if it be to be made into pitch, they put it into large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> vessels, without adding anything to it. It is then suffered to boil a while, and being then let out, is found when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> to be what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> pitch.\n\nA decoction of the nuts or seeds of the first species in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, or of the extremities of the branches pulled in spring, is said, with a proper regimen, to cure the most inveterate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCURVY\">scurvy</a>. The wood of this species is not valued; but that of the Scots pine is superior to any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. It is observable of the Scots pine, that when planted in bogs, or in a moist soil, though the plants make great progress, yet the wood is white, soft, and little esteemed; but when planted in a dry soil, though the growth of the trees is there very slow, yet the wood is proportionably better. Few trees have been applied to more uses than this. The tallest and straightest are formed by nature for masts to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>. The timber is resinous, durable, and applicable to numberless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> purposes, such as flooring and wainscoting of rooms, making of beds, chests, tables, boxes, &c. From the trunk and branches of this, as well as most others of the pine tribe, tar and pitch is obtained. By incision, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>-ras, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a> pitch, and turpentine, are acquired and prepared. The resinous roots are dug out of the ground in many parts of the Highlands, and, being divided into small splinters, are used by the inhabitants to burn, instead of candles.\u2014At Loch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROOM\">Broom</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROSS_SHIRE\">Ross-shire</a> the fishermen make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> of the inner bark; but hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> has taught the inhabitants of Sweden, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>, and Kamtchatka, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the same into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. To effect this, they, in the spring season, make choice of the tallest and fairest trees; then stripping off carefully the outer bark, they collect the soft, white, succulent interior bark, and dry it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. When they have occasion to use it, they first toast it at the fire, then grind, and after steeping the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a> in warm water to take off the resinous taste, they make it into thin cakes, which are baked for use. On this strange food the poor inhabitants are sometimes constrained to live for a whole year; and, we are told, through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, become at last even fond of it. Linnaeus remarks, that this same bark-bread will fatten swine; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> obliges us to wish, that men might never be reduced to the necessity of robbing them of such a food. The interior bark, of which the above-mentioned bread is made, the Swedish boys frequently peel off the trees in the spring, and eat raw with greedy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a>. From the cones of this tree is prepared a diuretic oil, like the oil of turpentine, and a resinous extract, which has similar virtues with the balsam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> of the buds is highly commended as an antiscorbutic.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> Index. There are 25 species, of which the most remarkable is the firiboa, with oval, heart-shaped, nerv\u00e8d leaves, and reflexed spikes. This is the plant which produces the pepper so much used in food. It is a shrub whose root is small, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>; it rises into a stem, which requires a tree <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> prop to support it. Its wood has the same sort of knots as the vine; and when it is dry, it exactly resembles the vine-branch. The leaves, which have a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> and a pungent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, are of an oval shape; but they diminish towards the extremity, and terminate in a point. From the flower-buds, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and are sometimes placed in the middle and sometimes at the extremity of the branches, are produced small berries resembling those of the currant tree. Each of these contains between 20 and 30 corns of pepper; they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> gathered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, and exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight days. The fruit which was green at first, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, when stripped of its covering affirms the appearance it has when we see it. The largest, heaviest, and least shrivelled, is the best.\n\nThe pepper plants flourishes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a> (a), and Ceylon, and more particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Malabar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>. It is not sown, but planted; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> nicety is required in the choice of the shoots. It produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fruit till the end of three years; but bears plentifully the three succeeding years, that some plants yield between five and seven pounds of pepper. The bark then begins to shrink; and the shrub declines so fast, that in 12 years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it ceases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a>.\n\nThe culture of pepper is not difficult: it is sufficient to plant it in a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and carefully to pull up the weeds that grow in great abundance round its roots, especially the three first years. As the sun is highly necessary to the growth of the pepper plant, when it is ready to bear, the trees that support it must be lopped to prevent their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> from injuring the fruit. When the season is over, it is proper to crop the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the plant. Without this precaution, there would be too much wood, and little fruit.\n\nThe pepper exported from Malabar, which was formerly entirely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Portuguese, and was afterwards divided between the Dutch, British, and French, amounted to about 10,000,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BETEL\">Betel</a>, or betle, is a species of this genus. See Betel. It is a creeping and climbing plant like the ivy; and its leaves a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> resemble those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CITRON\">citron</a>, though they are longer and narrower at the extremity. It grows in all parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, but thrives best in moist places. The natives cultivate it as we do the vine, placing props for it to run and climb upon; and it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> practice to plant it against the tree which bears the areca-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>.\n\nAt all times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, the Indians chew the leaves of the betel, the bittermels of which is corrected by the areca that is wrapped up in them.

Betel is taken after meals; it is chewed during a visit; it is offered when you meet, and when you separate; in short, nothing is to be done without betel. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> it is prejudicial to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, it afflicts and strengthens the stomach.

To find\nat piquet the probability which the eldest hand has of\ntaking an ace and a king in five cards, he having none\nin his hand. Answer: the odds against the eldest hand\ntaking an ace and a king are $331$ to $315$, or $21$ to $20$ nearly.\n\n4. To find at piquet the probability of having 12 cards dealt to, without king, queen, or knaves, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called cartes-blanches. Answer; the odds against cartes-blanches are $1791$ to $1$ nearly.\n\n5. To find how many different sets, essentially different from one another, one may have at piquet before taking in. Answer; $28,967,278$. This number falls short of the sum of all the distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, whereby 12 cards may be taken out of 32, this number being $225,792,840$; but it must be considered that in that number several sets of the same import, but differing in suit, might be taken, which would not introduce an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> among the sets.

The whole of its compass was 60 stadia, including the Munichia. Not far from the Piraeus stood the sepulchre of Themistocles; whither his friends conveyed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNESIA\">Magnesia</a>, into the Hither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, (Cicero, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, Paufanias).

Hippodamus an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, celebrated, besides other monuments of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, as the inventor of many improvements in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, was employed to lay out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. Five porticoes, which uniting formed the Long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTICO\">Portico</a>, were erected by the ports. Here was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGORA\">agora</a> or market-place, and, farther from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, another called Hippodamia. By the vessels were dwellings for the mariners. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> was opened, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> were raised, and the Piraeus, which surpassed the city in utility, began to equal it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. The cavities and windings of Munichia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>, were filled with houses; and the whole settlement, comprehending Phalerum and the ports of the Piraeus, with the ar\u00e9na, the storehouses, the famous armory of which Philo was the architect, and the fleets for 300, and afterwards 400, triremes, resembled the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, which had been planned by the same Hippodamus. The ports, on the commencement of the Peloponnesian...\nPiraeus, Peloponnesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, were secured with chains. Centinels were stationed, and the Piraeus was carefully guarded.\n\nThe Piraeus was reduced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> difficulty by Sulla, who demolished the walls, and set fire to the armory and arsenals. In the civil war it was in a defenseless condition. Calenus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> to Caesar, seized it, invested Athens, and ravaged the territory. Strabo, who lived under the emperors Augustus and Tiberius, observes, that the many wars had destroyed the long walls, with the fortresses of Munychia, and had contracted the Piraeus into a small settlement by the ports and the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>. This fabric was then adorned with wonderful pictures, the works of illustrious artists, and on the outside with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>. In the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, besides houses for triremes, the temple of Jupiter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> remained, with their images in bronzes, and a temple of Venus, a portico, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Themistocles.\n\nThe port of the Piraeus has been named Porto Liona, from the marble lion seen in the chart, and also Porto Dracco. The lion has been described as a piece of admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, 10 feet high, and as resting on its hinder parts. It was pierced, and, as some have conjectured, had belonged to a fountain. Near Athens, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEUSIS\">Eleusis</a>, was another, the posture couchant; probably its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>. Both these were removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> by the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> Morosini, and are to be seen there before the arsenal.

She dressed herself as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; and composed her band of rowers, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of her crew, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of young women attired in the same manner. Amongst the first of her cruises, she touched at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>\nof pirates bewailed the death of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>. The strangers were captivated with the agreeable manners of Alvilda, and chose her for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>. By this reinforcement she became formidable upon the sea, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Alf came to engage her.

Being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, he removed the casque; and in spite of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>, instantly recognized her, and offered her his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in wedlock.","sp":187,"ep":188},{"h":"PIRENE","t":"(Pliny); a fountain sacred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, springing below the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACROCORINTHUS\">Acrocorinthus</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and steep mountain which hangs over Corinth.

His reputation as a writer commenced with some pieces which he published for the entertainment of the populace, and which showed strong marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; but what fully established his character in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> intitled Metromancy, which was the best that had appeared in France since Regnard's Gamellet. This performance, in five acts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> conducted, replete with genius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, was acted with the greatest success upon the French stage in 1738. The author met with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> which was due to a man of real genius, and whose flashes of wit were inexhaustible. We shall insert a few anecdotes of him, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> serve to show his character and turn of mind.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a> the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUNE\">Beaune</a> are called the Affet de Beaune. Piron often indulged his satirical disposition at their expense. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> as he was taking a walk in the neighbourhood of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, he diverted himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all the thistles which he met with. When a friend asked him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for doing so, he replied, \"J'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AI\">ai</a> \u00e0 me plaindre des Beaunois; je leur coupe les vivres,\" i.e., \"I am sorry indeed for the Beaunois; for I am cutting down their food.\" Being told again that these people would certainly be revenged of him,\n\nAllez, (says he) Allez : je ne crains point leur impuissant courroux;\nEt quand je serais seul, je les battrais tous.\n\n\"Get you gone, get you gone: I fear not their feeble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>; for though alone, I should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> them all.\"\n\nGoing into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> where a play was acting, he asked what it was? The Cheats of Scapin, gravely replied a young Beaunian. \"Ah! Sir, (says Piron, after thanking him), I took it to be the Cheats of Orefles.\" In the time of the play, some body addressed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with \"Silence there, gentlemen, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">don</a>'t hear.\" \"It is not at least (cried Piron) for want of ears.\" A bishop one day asked Piron, during the disputes about Jansenism, \"Did you read my mandate, Mr Piron?\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>, my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>; and you\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> very warm, the bishop reminded him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> which birth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> had put between them. \"Sir (says Piron), I have plainly the superiority over you at this moment; for I am in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, and you are in the wrong.\"\u2014Voltaire's Semiramis did not meet with a very favourable reception the first time it was acted. The author finding Piron behind the scenes, asked him what he thought of his performance? \"I think (replied he) you would have been pleased that I had been the author of it.\" The performer of the character Ferdinand Cortez (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of one of Piron's tragedies) having requested some corrections to be made on the play the first time it was acted, Piron fired at the word corrections. The player, who was deputed to wait upon the author with this request, cited the example of Voltaire, who corrected some of his pieces in order to gratify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the public. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> are widely different (replied Piron); Voltaire works in chequer-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in brafs.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this answer be not very modest, we must allow that it does not want wit. He thought himself, if not superior, at least equal to Voltaire. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> congratulating him on having composed the best comedy of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he answered, with more frankness than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, \"Add too, and the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a>.\"\nThe following verses are well known, in which he says:\n\n*En deux mots voulez-vous distinguer et connoitre*\n*Le rimeur Dijonnois et le Parisien?*\n*Le premier ne fut rien, et ne voulut rien \u00eatre;*\n*L'autre voulut tout \u00eatre, et ne fut presque rien.*\n\nWe see by these different traits that Piron had a sufficient stock of self-conceit. What helped to increase it, and make him fancy himself superior to the most celebrated of his contemporaries, was, that his company, on account of his original humour, of which he had an uncommon share, was more courted than that of Voltaire, who was otherwise too lively, too captious, and crabbed. But those who have favoured us with an account of his many witticisms in conversation, would have done more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> if they had passed over such as were either indecent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> infipid. A thing often pleases over a glass of wine, which will not give the same satisfaction when it is repeated, especially if, in repeating it, you want to make it appear of some importance. Be that as it may, Piron's mischievous ingenuity was partly the cause which excluded him from the French Academy.\u2014\"I could not (said he) make thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> people think as I do, and I could less think as thirty-nine do.\" He called that celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> very unjustly *les invalides du bel esprit*, \"the invalids of wit;\" and yet he often endeavoured to be one of those invalids. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was hastened by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> which he got a little before. He died the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1773, at the age of 83. He had prepared for himself the following epitaph, in the way of an epigram:\n\n*Ci git Piron, qui ne fut rien,*\n*Pas m\u00eame acad\u00e9micien.*\n\n\"Here lies Piron, who was nothing, not even an academician.\"\n\nHis wife <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Theresa Quenandon, who died in 1751, he describes as a sweet and most agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>. They lived together for several years; and no husband ever discharged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> with more fidelity and attention.\n\nA collection of his works appeared in 1776, in 7 vols 8vo, and 9 vols 12mo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> pieces are, The School of Fathers; a comedy acted in 1728 under the title of Ungrateful Sons. Callithene; a tragedy, the subject of which is taken from Juvin. The Mysterious Lover, a comedy. Gustavus and Ferdinand Cortez, two tragedies; some scenes of which discover an original genius, but the versification neither pleases the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> nor affects the heart. Metromany, a comedy. The Courtes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPE\">Tempe</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> pastoral, in which the manners both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> are pleasantly drawn. Some odes, poems, fables, and epigrams. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> he was very successful, and he may be placed after Marot and Rousseau. There was no occasion for loading the public with 7 vols of his works; the half of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> might have sufficed. For, excepting Metromany, Gustavus, the Courtes of Tempe, some odes, about 20 epigrams, three or four fables, and some epistles, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> are but indifferent, and have no claim to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> merit.","sp":188,"ep":189},{"h":"PISA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, situated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the river Arno, 12 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>.

The university is well endowed, and has able <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a>, but is not in a very flourishing condition. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> is a stately structure, but little frequented.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> is supported by 76 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> marble pillars of different colours, and finely gilt. Both the church and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPOLA\">cupola</a> are covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>.

In the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NAVE\">nave</a> of the church you see two brazen tombs, raised upon pillars. The marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a> was carved by John Pifano, and the choir by Julian da Majana. Joining thereto is the altar, over which is preferred a hollow globe or vessel of marble, wherein they kept the sacrament for the new baptized, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Father Mabillon.

Here are a great many ancient tombs, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> that of Beatrice, mother of the countess Mathilda, with marble basso-relievos, which the Pisans brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, where you see the hunt of Meleager, which assisted Nicholas of Pisa in the reformation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>. The walls of the Campo Santo are painted by the best masters of their times. Giotto has drawn six historical pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a>; and Andrea Orgagna has given a fine piece of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> judgement. Under the portico there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of the city, ordering the inhabitants to wear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> a year for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Cesar.\nNear the church you see a steeple in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, to which you ascend by 153 steps; it inclines 15 feet on one side, which some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to art, but others to the sinking of the foundation. Its inclination is so great that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMB_LINE\">plumb-line</a> let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the top touches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of almost 15 feet from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. It was built by John of Infruck and Bonanno of Pisa, in 1174. Near this steeple is a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, dependent on that of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Nuova in Florence.\n\nThe steeple of the church of the Augustinians is also very fine, being an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCTAGON\">octagon</a>, adorned with pillars, and built by Nicholas of Pisa. In the great market-place there is a statue of Plenty, by Pierino da Vinci. In the church of St Matthew, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> by the brothers Mclani, natives of this city, is an admired performance. The church of the knights of St Stephen, decorated with the trophies taken from the Saracens, is all of marble, with marble steps, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> adorned with marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>. In the square there is a statue of Cosimo I. upon a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">Contiguous</a> to the church is the convent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the knights, which is worth seeing, as also the churches Della Madonna and Della Spina; the last of which was built by a beggar, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> you may see on the outside of the wall. It is pretended that one of the thorns of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> which was placed on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>'s head is preserved here. Belonging to the university there is a great number of colleges, the chief of which is the Sapienza, where the professors read their public lectures; next to which are the colleges Puteano, Ferdinando, Ricci, and others. Besides the public palace, and that of the grand duke, there are several others with marble fronts, the finest of which is that of Lanfranchi, which, with the rest along the banks of the Arno, makes a very fine appearance. There is here a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCK\">dock</a>, where they build the galleys, which are conveyed by the Arno to Leghorn. They have a famous aqueduct in this town, consisting of 9000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, which conveys the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from the hills at five miles distance. This water is esteemed the best in Italy, and is carried in flasks to Florence and Leghorn. The neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> produces great store of corn and wine, but the latter is not much esteemed. They have very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> in this neighbourhood, which is a scarce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> in Italy. The city for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOAT\">moat</a>, walls, a castle, fort, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>; the last of which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> work. The Arno is of a considerable breadth here, and has three bridges over it, one of them of marble: two leagues below the town it falls into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. The physic garden is very spacious, contains a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and is decorated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a>: over the door leading into it are these words,\n\nHic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGUS\">Argus</a> sed non <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIAREUS\">Briareus</a> est: i.e. \"Employ the eyes of Argus, but not the hands of Briareus.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is said to be unwholesome here in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the neighbouring marshes.

After he had rendered himself the favourite of the populace by his liberality and by the intrepidity with which he had fought their battles, particularly near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMIS\">Salamis</a>, he resolved to make himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Everything seemed favourable to his ambitious views; but Solon alone, who was then at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of affairs, and who had lately enforced his celebrated laws, opposed him, and discovered his duplicity and artful behaviour before the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>. Pisistratus was not disheartened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of his relation Solon, but he had recourse to artifice. In returning from his country-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, he cut himself in various places; and after he had exposed his mangled body to the eyes of the populace, deplored his misfortunes, and accused his enemies of attempts upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, because he was the friend of the people, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, and the reliever of the oppressed, he claimed a chosen body of 50 men from the populace to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> from the malevolence and the cruelty of his enemies. The unsuspicious people unanimously granted his request, though Solon opposed it with all his influence; and Pisistratus had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner received an armed band <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> whose fidelity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> he could rely, than he seized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, and made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>. The people too late perceived their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a>; yet, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> was popular, two of the citizens, Megacles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>, conspired together against him, and by their means he was forcibly ejected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. His house and all his effects were exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>; but there was found in Athens only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who would buy them. The private dissensions of the friends of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> proved favourable to the expelled tyrant; and Megacles, who was jealous of Lycurgus, secretly promised to restore Pisistratus to all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and privileges in Athens, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he would marry his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. Pisistratus consented; and by the affiance of his father-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, he was soon enabled to expel Lycurgus, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-establish himself. By means of a woman called Phya, whose shape was tall, whose features were noble and commanding, he imposed upon the people, and created himself adherents even among his enemies. Phya was conducted through the streets of the city, and showing herself subservient to the artifice of Pisistratus, she was announced as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and the patroness of Athens, who came <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> to re-establish her favourite Pisistratus in a power which was sanctioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of Heaven, and favoured by the affection of the people. In the midst of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>, however, Pisistratus found himself unsupported; and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after, when\nPisistratus, when he repudiated the daughter of Megacles, he found that not only the citizens, but even his very troops, were alienated from him by the influence, the intrigues, and the bribery of his father-in-law. He fled from Athens where he no longer could maintain his power, and retired to Euboea. Eleven years after he was drawn from his obscure retreat, by means of his son Hippias, and he was a third time received by the people of Athens as their master and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>. Upon this he sacrificed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> the friends of Megacles, but he did not lose sight of the public good, and while he fought the aggrandizement of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, he did not neglect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. He died about 528 years before the Christian era, after he had enjoyed the sovereign power at Athens for 33 years, and he was succeeded by his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>. Pisistratus claims our admiration for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, his liberality, and his moderation. If he was dreaded and detested as a tyrant, the Athenians loved and respected his private virtues and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> as a fellow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a>; and the opprobrium which generally falls on his head may be attributed not to the severity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, but to the republican principles of the Athenians, who hated and exclaimed against the moderation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> of the mildest sovereign, while they flattered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and gratified the guilty desires of the most tyrannical of their fellow subjects. Pisistratus often refused to punish the insolence of his enemies; and when he had one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> been virulently accused of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, rather than inflict immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> upon the man who had criminated him, he went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AREOPAGUS\">areopagus</a>, and there convinced the Athenians that the accusations of his enemies were groundless, and that his life was irreproachable. It is to his labours that we are indebted for the preservation of the poems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>; and he was the first, according to Cicero, who introduced them at Athens in the order in which they now stand. He also established a public library at Athens; and the valuable books which he had diligently collected were carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-XERXES\">Xerxes</a> made himself master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>. Hipparchus and Hippias the sons of Pisistratus, who had received the name of Pisistratides, rendered themselves as illustrious as their father; but the flames of liberty were too powerful to be extinguished. The Pisistratide governed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> moderation, but the name of tyrant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sovereign was unsupportable to the Athenians. Two of the most respectable of the citizens, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMODIUS\">Harmodius</a> and Aristogeiton, conspired against them, and Hipparchus was dispatched in a public assembly. This murder was not, however, attended with any advantages; and though the two leaders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, who have been celebrated through every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> for their patriotism, were supported by the people, yet Hippias quelled the tumult by his uncommon firmness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, and for a while preserved that peace in Athens which his father had often been unable to command. This was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> to continue. Hippias was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> expelled by the united efforts of the Athenians and of their allies, and he left Attica, when he found himself unable to maintain his power and independence. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the family of Pisistratus followed him in his banishment; and after they had refused to accept the liberal offers of the princes of Thessaly, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, who wished them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in their respective territories, the Pisistratide retired to Sigeum, which their father had in the summit of his power conquered and bequeathed to his posterity. After the banishment of the Pisistratide, the Athenians became more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> jealous of their liberty, and often sacrificed the most powerful of their citizens, apprehensive of the influence which popularity and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-directed liberality might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> among a fickle and unsettled populace. The Pisistratide were banished from Athens about 18 years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Pisistratus.\n\nPismires, or Ants, are a kind of insects very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; of which there is so great a variety, and such innumerable swarms, that they destroy not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> but sometimes even men and beasts in little time as one single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>; and would, without all doubt, prove more fatally destructive to the inhabitants, were they not so happily destroyed by a proportionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of monkeys and other animals, who greedily devour them. The far greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the vast continent of Africa is afflicted with these and some other grievous plagues, and particularly with the horrid visitation of locusts, which seldom fail a year of laying waste some of the provinces.\n\nPiso, Lucius Calpurnius, surnamed Frugi on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his frugality, was descended of the illustrious family of the Pisos, which gave so many great men to the Roman republic. He was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a> of the people in the year 149 before Christ, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>. During his tribuneship, he published a law against the crime of concupiscence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a>, intitled Lex Calpurnia de pecuniae repetundis. He happily ended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>. To reward the services of one of his sons, who had distinguished himself in that expedition, he left him by his will a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, weighing 20 pounds. Piso joined to the qualities of a good citizen the talents of a lawyer, an orator, and historian.\n\nPiso, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> Calpurnius, a Roman consul in the year 67 before Christ, was author of the law which forbade canvassing for public offices, intitled Lex Calpurnia de ambitu. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> all the firmness worthy of a consul in one of the most stormy periods of the republic. The Roman people, deceived by the flattery of Marcus Palicanus, a turbulent and factious fellow, were on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a> of loading themselves with the greatest disgrace, by putting the supreme authority into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of this man, who deserved punishment rather than honours. The tribunes of the people, by their harangues, inflamed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> fury of the multitude, already sufficiently mutinous of themselves. In this situation, Piso mounted the rostrum, and being asked if he would declare Palicanus consul, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the suffrages of the people should concur in the nomination, he instantly replied, that \"he did not think the republic was yet involved in such darkness and despair as to be capable of committing so infamous an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>.\" Being afterwards strongly and repeatedly called upon to say, \"what he would do, if the thing should happen?\" his answer was, \"No, I would not name him.\" By this firm and laconic answer he deprived Palicanus of the dignity to which he aspired. Piso, according to Cicero, was not possessed of a quick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, but he thought maturely, and with judgment, and, by a proper firmness, he appeared to be an abler man than he really was.\nPiso, Cnecius Calpurnius, was consul in the reign of Augustus, and governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> under Tiberius, whose confidant he was. It is said, that by the order of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> he caused Germanicus to be poisoned. Being accused of that crime, and seeing himself abandoned by every body, he laid violent hands on himself in the 26th year of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>. He was a man of infupportable pride and excessive violence. Some instances of his wicked cruelty have been handed down to us. Having given orders in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> to conduct to punishment a folder, as guilty of the death of one of his companions, because he had gone out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> with him and returned without him, no prayers or intreaty could prevail with Piso to suspend the execution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> until the affair should be properly investigated. The folder was led without the entrenchments, and had already presented his head to receive the fatal stroke, when his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> whom he was accused of having killed made his appearance again. Whereupon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a>, whose office it was to see the sentence executed, ordered the executioner to put up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> into the scabbard. Those two companions, after embracing each other, are conducted to Piso, amidst the acclamations of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and a prodigious crowd of people. Piso, foaming with rage, ascends his tribune, and pronounces the same sentence of death against the whole three, without excepting the centurion who had brought back the condemned folder, in these terms: \"You I order to be put to death because you have been already condemned; you, because you have been the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of your comrade; and you, because having got orders to put that folder to death, you have not obeyed your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>.\"\n\nPissasphaltum, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASPHALTUM\">Asphaltum</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a>-pitch; a fluid, opaque, mineral body, of a thick consistence, strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, readily inflammable, but leaving a residuum of greyish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>.

Cropping over the top of the latter, which is not half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and descending in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, one is conducted to a hole well known to the inhabitants. This hole extends not much above 12 feet, and from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> above 25 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>, arise the marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> which sustain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> masses that sur-round the top of the mountain.\n\nThis piffalphaltum is of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and shining, very pure, odoriferous, and cohesive; and it comes out almost liquid, but hardens in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> drops when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> sets. On breaking many of these drops on the spot, I found that almost every one of them had an inner cavity full of very clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\n\n\"The greatest breadth of the tears that I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> was two inches, and the common breadth is half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>. The chinks and fissures of the marble, from whence this bituminous pitch tranfudes, are not more than the thickness of a thread; and for the most part are so imperceptible, that were it not for the pitch itself, whereby they are blackened, they could not by any means be distinguished by the naked eye. To the narrowness of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> is, no doubt, in part owing the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of piffalphaltum that tranfpires.\"\n\nAfter some conjectures about the origin of this mine, our author proceeds to inform us that the piffalphaltum of Bua is correspondent to that fossil production which by Haefelquilt, in his Travels, is called mumia minerales, and mumia nativa Persiana by Kempfer, which the Egyptians made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of to embalm their kings (A). It is found in a cave of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>, which is kept shut, and carefully guarded by order of the king of Persia. One of the qualities assigned by M. Linn\u00e6us to the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">bitumen</a> is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> when laid on the fire, as ours does, emitting a smell of pitch not disagreeable. He believes it would be very good for wounds, as the oriental mummia is, and like the pitch of Caltro, which is frequently used by the Roman surgeons for fractures, contusions, and in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> applications. See ASPHALTUM, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINERALOGY\">MINERALOGY</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nPissell\u00e6um Indicum, Barbados <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAR\">Tar</a>; a mineral fluid of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the thicker bitumens, and of all others the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a>, in appearance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and consistence, to the true piffalphaltum, but differing from it in other respects.

These are garnished with winged leaves, composed sometimes of two, at other times of three, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of lobes, terminated by an odd one: these lobes approach towards an oval shape, and their edges are turned backward; and these, when bruised, emit a smell similar to that of the shell of the nut. Some of these trees produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and some have both male and female on the same tree. The male flowers come out from the sides of the branches in loose bunches or catkins. They have no petals, but five small stamens crowned by large four-cornered summits filled with farina; and when this is discharged, the flowers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off. The female flowers come out in clusters from the sides of the branches: they have no petals, but a large oval germen supporting three reflexed styles, and are succeeded by oval nuts.\n\n2. The lentifcus, or common mastic tree, grows naturally in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. Being an evergreen, it has been preferred in this country in order to adorn the green-houses. In the countries where it is a native, it rises to the height of 18 or 20 feet, covered with a grey bark on the stem; but the branches, which are very numerous, are covered with a reddish brown bark, and are garnished with winged leaves, composed of three or four pair of small spear-shaped lobes, without an odd one at the end.\n\n3. The orientalis, or true mastic tree of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, from which the malachite is gathered, has been confounded by most botanical writers with the lentifcus, or common mastic tree, above described, though there are considerable differences between them. The bark of the tree is brown; the leaves are composed of two or three pair of spear-shaped lobes, terminated by an odd one: the outer lobes are the largest; the others gradually diminish, the innermost being the least. These turn of a brownish colour towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, when the plants are exposed to the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; but if they are under glasses, they keep green. The leaves continue all the year, but are not so thick as those of the common sort, nor are the plants so hardy.\n\nCulture. The first species is propagated by its nuts, which should be planted in pots filled with light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>-garden earth, and plunged into a moderate hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> to bring up the plants; when these appear, they should have a large share of air admitted to them, and by degrees they should be exposed to the open air, which at last they will bear in all seasons, though not without great danger of being destroyed in severe winters. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> sort is commonly propagated by laying down the branches, though it may also be raised from the seed in the manner already directed for the pistacia-nut tree; and in this manner also may the true mastic-tree be raised. But this being more tender than any of the other sorts, requires to be constantly sheltered in winter, and to have a warm situation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nPistacia nuts are moderately large, containing a kernel of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> greenish colour, covered with a reddish skin. They have a pleasant, sweet, unctuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, resembling that of almonds; and they abound with a sweet and well-tasted oil, which they yield in great abundance on being pressed after bruising them: they are reckoned amongst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALEPTICS\">analeptics</a>, and are wholesome and nutritious, and are by some esteemed very proper to be prescribed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of restoratives, eaten in small quantity, to people emaciated by long illness.","sp":190,"ep":193},{"h":"PISTIL","t":"among botanists, the little upright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> which is generally found in the centre of every flower.

This was brought from Cape Horn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Anson's cook, when he passed that cape, where these peas were a great relief to the sailors. It is kept here as a curiosity, but the peas are not so good for eating as the worst sort now cultivated in Britain. It is a low trailing plant; the leaves have two lobes on each foot-stalk: those below are spear-shaped, and sharply indented on their edges; but the upper leaves are small, and arrow-pointed. The flowers are blue, each foot-stalk sustaining four or five flowers; the pods are taper, near three inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>; and the seeds are round, about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARES\">tares</a>.\n\nThe sixth sort is annual. This grows naturally among the corn in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a> and some parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, but is here preserved in botanic gardens for the sake of variety.

These are by some persons eaten green; but unless they are gathered very young, they are coarse, and at best not so good as the common pea. It may be sown and managed in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> as the garden pea.\n\nFor an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of cultivating the several sorts of garden peas, so as to continue them throughout the season, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">Gardening</a>.\n\nThe gray and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> winter peas are seldom cultivated in gardens, because they require a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of room; they are therefore usually sown in fields. For the proper method of managing them, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a> Rusticum, vol. i. p. 109, we find the following method of preparing peas for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, which we shall give in the words of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> who communicated it.\n\n\"A few years ago (says he), I had a plentiful crop of peas on a ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> piece, which lies near my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>: when they were full podded and nearly ripe, I had them hooked in the usual manner; but before I could get them in, there came a heavy shower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> which wetted them through and through; and the dull heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, with frequent showers which followed, prevented their drying for a considerable time.\n\n\"I caused the wads to be from time to time turned, to prevent the haulm from rotting; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> a few days sunshine dried them enough to be mowed; for as they lay hollow, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> was greatly assistant to the operation.\n\n\"Before I got them in, on examining some of the pods, I found that the peas were all sprouted to a considerable length; this was what I had expected, as I gave my crop over for loft, till after a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, as the weather still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fine, I determined to thresh them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>.\n\n\"This was accordingly done; and the corn, after it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and riddled to separate it from the rubbish, was dried on my malt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILN\">kiln</a>.\n\n\"When this operation was over, I began to reflect in what manner I should dispose of my peas, being sensible that they could not be proper for feed, and standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> chance of disposing of them to any advantage in the market.\n\n\"At length, as it was then a time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and of course there was a great demand for pork for the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, I determined to buy a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of lean hogs, that I might by their means consume this crop on my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>, and in that manner make the most of it.\n\n\"My expectations were more than answered; for I found, by repeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that three bushels of the peas I have mentioned went nearly as far in fattening the hogs I bought as four bushels got in dry and hard in the manner usually practised.\n\n\"This discovery I made several years ago, and it has turned out to my advantage; for since that time I have been quite indifferent as to the weather in which my peas are hooked, being rather better pleased, as far as relates to them, with wet than dry weather;\"\nPIT\n\nther; but if the weather happens to be dry at the time they are ripe, I always cause as many as I want for feeding my hogs, which are not a few in a year, to be regularly malted in the same manner nearly as my barley: this management has of late succeeded very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> with me, and I therefore intend to continue it.\n\n\"Besides feeding my hogs with these malted pease, I have often given them to my horses, with which they agree very well, and are heartening food.\n\n\"Turkeys will fatten apace on them also, and be fine meat.\n\n\"I have applied my malted pease to many other uses, which I have not at present time to enumerate: but were they only used for feeding hogs and horses, it is still worth while to prepare some in this manner every year.\"","sp":193,"ep":195},{"h":"PITCAIRNE","t":"Dr Archibald, an eminent physician and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> poet, was descended from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Pitcairnes of Pitcairne in Fifehire, and was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1652. He commenced his studies at the school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALKEITH\">Dalkeith</a>; and from thence he was removed to the university of Edinburgh, where he improved himself in classical learning, and completed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. His friends, according to the authors of the Biographia Britannica, were delirious that he should follow the profession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>. The unpleasant gloom, however, which at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> hung over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> Pitcairne in Scotland, could not but very ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> with that native cheerfulness of temper and liberality of mind which made him, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after, a mark for the arrows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> and grimace. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> seems to have been his own choice, and to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> he turned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. With an ardour peculiar to himself, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> to excel in whatever he undertook, he pursued it with so much intensity, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> began to be impaired. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, his physicians advised him to let out for the south of France. By the time he reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he was happily so far recovered, that he determined to renew his studies; but being informed that there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> able professor of law in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and finding several gentlemen of his acquaintance engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of physic, he went with them to the lectures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and employed himself in this manner for several months till his affairs called him home.\n\nOn his return, he applied himself chiefly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. It is not usual to see the briars of this science and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> growing in the same foil. Here, however, they were happily united; and to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> perhaps was owing that singular command of judgement, over one of the liveliest of fancies, which appears in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his works. His intimacy with Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Gregory, the celebrated mathematical professor, began about the same time; and probably conduced to cherish his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> aptitude for this study. It was then in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, new to him; it soon became his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> delight; his progress in it was rapid, and correspondent to his progress in other pursuits. His improvements on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> then adopted, which Dr Wallis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> afterwards published, were a conspicuous and early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his abilities in this science.\n\nHad Dr Pitcairne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to prosecute the study of the law, and could he have moulded his principles to the times, the first offices and honours of the state might have been looked for without presumption as the probable reward of such talents as he possessed. Struck, however with the charms of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> which had been lately introduced into the philosophy of medicine, and hoping to reduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALING\">healing</a> art to geometrical method, he unalterably determined on this less aspiring profession. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when he formed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the medical world, already sufficiently confused, were still farther jumbled by the discovery of the circulation of the blood, which had as yet produced nothing but doubt, uncertainty, and astonishment. In Edinburgh at that time there was no school, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, no opportunity of improvement but the chamber and the shop. He therefore soon after returned to Paris. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">Genius</a> and industry are unhappily not often united in the same character: of such an union, however, Dr Pitcairne is a celebrated instance. During his residence in France, he cultivated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his pursuit with his natural enthusiasm, and with a steadfastness from which he could not be diverted by the allurements of that joy which, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> of social and festive intercourse, he always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> and always gave. Among his various occupations, the study of the ancient physicians seems to have had a principal share. This appears from a treatise which he published some time after his return; and it shows, that he wisely determined\nto know the progress of medicine from its earliest periods, before he attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> and improve that science.\n\nOn the 13th of August 1689, he received, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHEIMS\">Rheims</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>; which, on the 7th of August 1699, was likewise conferred on him by the university of Aberdeen; both being attended with marks of peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. Other medical honours are said to have been conferred on him in France and elsewhere; but nothing affords a more unequivocal testimony to his abilities than that which the surgeons of Edinburgh gave, in admitting him, freely and unostentatiously, a member of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>. None had such opportunities of judging of his merit as a practitioner, and on no physician did they ever bestow the same public mark of respect. Soon after his graduation at Rheims, he returned to Edinburgh; where, on the 29th of November 1681, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> College of Physicians was instituted; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, among others, graced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> patent from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>.\n\nIn his Soluto Problematis de Inventoribus, the treatise above alluded to, he discovers a wonderful degree of medical literature, and makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it in a manner that does great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> both to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and his heart. His object is to vindicate Dr Harvey's claim to the discovery of the circulation of the blood. The discovery was, at first, controverted by envy, and reproached by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>. When at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> its truth was fully established, many invidiously attempted to tear the laurels from the illustrious Englishman, and to plant them on the brows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> and others. Had the attempt been directed against himself, the generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of Pitcairne could not have exerted more zeal in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; and his arguments remain unanswered.\n\nDuring his residence in Scotland, his reputation became so considerable, that, in the year 1691, the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> solicited him to fill the medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, at that time vacant. Such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> testimony of respect, from a foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and from such an university, cannot perhaps be produced in the medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIOGRAPHY\">biography</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. The lustre of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> reflects honour on their profession, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> which has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> of giving them birth; and serves to give the individuals of that country not only a useful estimation in their own eyes, but in those also of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the world. Dr Pitcairne's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> principles excluded him from public honours and promotion at home; he therefore accepted the invitation from abroad; and, on the 26th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1692, delivered, at Leyden, his elegant and masterly inaugural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>: Oratio qua ostenditur medicinam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> omni philo-\n\n(A) Dr Boerhaave gives the following character of these and some other of Dr Pitcairne's dissertations, which were collected and published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>, anno 1701: \"Hec scripta optima sunt et perfecta, five legas Dissertacionem de Motu Sanguinis per Pulmones, five alia opuscula, five ultimum tractatum de Opio.\" Methodus studii, ab Hallero edita, p. 509.\n\n(B) He had been married before to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> James Hay of Pitfour, by whom he had a son and daughter, who both died young.\n\n(C) Vide Pitcairnii Poemata.\u2014Several of his poems, however, are obscure, and some of them totally unintelligible without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>. In those of them which are of a political kind, he wished not to express himself too clearly; and in others, he alludes to private occurrences which were not known beyond the circle of his companions. His poem (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">Ad</a> Lindeium), addressed to his friend Lindley, is commented on by the authors of the Biographia Britannica; and it is to be regretted that it is the only one on which they have been solicitous to throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>.\nexerted in the cure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, still operate to the good of posterity.\n\nThe discovery of the circulation, while in some measure it exploded the chemical and Galenical doctrines, tended to introduce mathematical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> in their stead. Of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> (n) Dr Pitcairne was the principal support, and the first who introduced it into Britain. A mathematical turn of mind, and a wish for mathematical certainty in medicine, biased him in its favour, and he pushed it to its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. One is at a loss whether most to admire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> regret such a waste of talents in propounding a theory which, though subversive of former ones, was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> before others but a little more satisfactory than itself. Mechanical physicians expected more from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> than that science could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>. They made it the foundation instead of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> to their inquiries, and applied it to parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> not admitting mathematical calculations. By paying more attention afterwards to the supreme influence of the living principle, the source of all the motions and functions of the body, it was found that these could not be explained by any laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> or mechanism. They are still, however, involved in obscurity; and notwithstanding the numberless improvements which have taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the sciences connected with medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> perhaps remain incurable while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> continues in his present stage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\nIn a science so slowly progressive as that of medical practice, Dr Pitcairne did a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>. By labouring in vain for truth in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, he saved many the same drudgery, and thereby showed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of another. He not only exploded many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> notions of the chemists and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALENISTS\">Galenists</a> which prevailed in his time, but many of those too of his own feet. In particular, he showed the absurdity of referring all diseases and their cures to an alkali or an acid (r). He refuted the idea of secretion being performed by pores differently shaped (v), Bellini's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of effervescences in the animal spirits with the blood, and Bonelli's of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> entering the blood by respiration (g). He proved the continuity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> and veins (h); and seems to have been the first who showed that the blood flows from a smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> into a larger; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AORTA\">aorta</a>, with respect to the arterial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> of a cone (i). In this therefore he may be considered as the latent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of the discoveries respecting the powers moving the blood. He introduced a simplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> unknown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a> before his time (k); and such was the state of medicine in this country, that scarcely have the works of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> or preceding author been thought worthy even of preservation (l). As to the errors of his philosophy, let it be remembered, that no theory has as yet stood the test of many years in an enlightened period. His own hung very loosely.\n\nlight. \"Some parts (fay they) of this poem, are hardly intelligible, without knowing a circumstance in the doctor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, which he often told, and never without some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>. It is a well known story of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> philosophers, who promised one another, that whichever died first should make a visit to his surviving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>. This story being read by Mr Lindley and our author together, they being both then very young, entered into the same engagement. Soon after, Pitcairne, at his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in Fife, dreamed one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> that Lindley, who was then at Paris, came to him, and told him he was not dead, as was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> reported, but still alive, and lived in a very agreeable place, to which he could not yet carry him. By the course of the poet news came of Lindley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened very suddenly the morning of the dream. When this is known, the poem is easily understood, and shines with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>.\n\n\"Lyndell!

Vid. the article Monro.\nPITCAIRNE loosely about him (m); and the present generally received practice differs from his very little in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>.\n\nHe treated inflammatory and hemorrhagic diseases by bleeding, purging, and blistering, as has been done uniformly and solely on the different theories since. His method of administering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> and the bark is observed at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and with respect to febrile, nervous, glandular, and tropical affections, they seem to be as often the opprobrium of the art now as they were then.\n\nDr Pitcairne was universally considered as the first physician of his time. No one appeared ever to have had so much practice in this country, or so many consultations from abroad; and no one, from all accounts, ever practised with greater sagacity and success. The highest thought themselves honoured by his acquaintance, and the lowest were never denied his assistance and advice. The emoluments of his profession must have been great; but his charities are known to have been correspondent. The possession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> he postponed to more liberal objects; he collected one of the finest private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> in the world; which was purchased, after his death, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CZAR\">Czar</a> of Muscovy. Notwithstanding the fatigues he underwent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of his profession, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> was naturally delicate.

This, however, proved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> real obstacle to his preferment in the state, for in the year 1756 he became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> minister.\n\nAs the present earl of Chatham was destined for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and another son James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> Chatham resolved to train up William to the profession of a statesman. Having therefore confided the care of his other two sons to others, he took William under his own immediate inspection, whose rapid progress cheered the solitude, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILLUMINED\">illumined</a> the declining days of this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who already began to prefigure his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> greatness. His school exercises were performed under the care of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>, a Mr. afterwards Dr Wilson, while his noble father embraced every opportunity of conversing with him on every interesting topic with the utmost freedom, in order to expand his mind, and mature his judgement. He also made him declaim from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> knowing that the gift of eloquence is a valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> for a young man who wishes to arrive at eminence, and that it had supplied the deficiencies of fortune in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>.\n\nIt was resolved on, at a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, to send William to one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, and on this occasion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> was preferred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, from a decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> entertained by many, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> doctrines inculcated at the former were more liberal than those usually propagated at the latter. He was accordingly placed under the tuition of Dr Turner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>. Dr Prettyman, afterwards bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, also participated in the care of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and was his private instructor. During his residence at Cambridge, it appears certain that the morals and conduct of Mr Pitt were unimpeachable, not in the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> contaminated by the powerful example of the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. Here he took his bachelor's degree, and also that of A.M. and acquired such reputation in the university for talents, industry, and propriety of deportment, as proved of great advantage to him in his subsequent pursuits through life.\n\nWhen Mr Pitt left the university, he was entered at Lincoln's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>, much about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with Mr Addington, whose father had been both the physician and friend of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and was enabled to be called to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> in the space of three years, having received some marks of favour on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his degree. He made choice of the western circuit as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of his first efforts; but having little practice as an lawyer, he had of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> but little celebrity; and it is probable that he was ill qualified, on the score of patient and laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, for a pursuit in which nothing great can be accomplished, without the persevering industry of a whole life.\n\nFortune at this time seemed eager to heap favours upon him of another kind. Being bred a statesman, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons was of course the place where he was to begin his political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. He was advised by numerous friends to propose himself a candidate for the university of Cambridge, but he failed of success from the want of sufficient influence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">Accident</a>, however, brought about what the designs of his friends could not accomplish. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Rutland asked Sir James Lowther (afterwards earl of Lonsdale), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he could possibly make room in any of his boroughs, to bring in his young friend Mr Pitt, who had thus lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> for Cambridge. He was chosen member for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGH\">borough</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLEBY\">Appleby</a>. About this time the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> was raging with unabated violence, which Mr Pitt, following the example and advice of his father, reproached as one of the most shameful and ruinous conflicts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. Having espoused the constitutional and popular side of this important question, his opening talents were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> to no common advantage, and he was not only regarded as a promising speaker, but as destined at some future period to rank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> in the councils of his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This was truly honourable to so young a man, when it is remembered that one horse could then boast of a Rockingham, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a>, and a Shelburne, and the other of a Savile, a Dunning, a Burke, a Barr\u00e9, and a Fox. Yet there was still room for our juvenile orator, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of the eloquence, the talents, and the meritorious services of his father, contributed greatly to fix the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mankind on the deportment of a favourite son.\n\nAbout this time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> engaged the attention both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> and the public, and a vote of the commons, \"that the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished,\" plainly pointed to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, whether real or imaginary, which occasioned a considerable degree of discontent. Mr Burke, then in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a> of his popularity, encouraged by numerous symptoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, once more brought forward his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of economy, which being founded on a progressive retrenchment, appeared admirably calculated to diminish the influence of the crown. It is needless to add that it was opposed by the minister (Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>), but it was ably supported by Mr Pitt, who forcibly ridiculed every objection that could be brought against it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> was rejected after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> debate, but afterwards introduced at a more auspicious period, and to a certain extent carried into effect.\n\nMr Fox having moved that ministers should immediately take every possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> for concluding a peace with our American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, he was powerfully supported by Mr Pitt, whose commanding eloquence engaged the whole attention of the house, while he reproved the cruelty and impolicy of the contest with our colonies. He declared that it was conceived in injustice, nurtured and brought forth in folly, and its footsteps were marked with blood, slaughter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, and devastation. Many handsome compliments were paid him by two eminent judges of real merit, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the lord advocate of Scotland (now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VISCOUNT\">Viscount</a> Melville), and Mr Wilkes. The former, in particular, declared that his powerful abilities and brilliant eloquence were universally acknowledged proofs, that the astonishing extent and force of an exalted understanding had descended, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> line, from the late illustrious possessor of them, to a son equally endowed with all the fire, and strength, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of oratory.\nA more equal representation of the people in parliament was one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> objects to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> directed its attention, next to the American war. It was admitted to be the undoubted prerogative of the crown to declare war; but as the supplies were entrusted to the management of the representatives of the people, it was affirmed by some that ministers could not have carried on a contest accompanied with the waste of so much blood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, had it not been owing to the corruption and venality of parliament. To derive advantage from past <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; to confer on the people their due importance in such a mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> as that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, and restore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> purity, became by this time the grand object of Mr Pitt's exertions. He was, as yet untainted by the fascinating charms of power and authority, and considered a well-earned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> as the best, the only reward of his laudable endeavours. He accordingly brought the principles and conduct of his opponents to such a test as they successfully employed against himself, in order to wound his feelings, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICT\">convict</a> him of inconsistency, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> his back on his once favourite sentiments. When many cities and counties endeavoured to obtain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> in parliament, Mr Pitt actually sat in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a> of delegates, met together in the neighbourhood of the place where the legislature held its sittings.\n\nThe American war in the mean time was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> to a termination, and the spoils of the office of the former minister became the reward of those who opposed him. During the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of the Rockingham administration, contractors were excluded from the house of commons; officers belonging to the customs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a> were declared unqualified to vote at elections; the proceedings respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> election were rescinded; and while a more liberal policy was adopted with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, many superstitious offices were abolished in England by means of a reform bill, which tended powerfully to destroy corruption. Many more important reforms would have been accomplished, had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the distinguished Rockingham brought about great and sudden changes.\n\nMr Fox retired in consequence of new arrangements, and Lord Shelburne, as first lord of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, made choice of Mr Pitt as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of the exchequer, who, declared, although only 23 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, that he would accept of no inferior office. Peace now seemed to be an object generally desirable at any rate, and without much regarding what sacrifices might be made in order to procure it; but the terms met with powerful opposition from two men formerly considered as mortal enemies, viz. Lord North and Mr Fox, the latter of whom retired from office. Soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of Mr Fox, Mr Pitt again brought forward the question respecting a reform in parliament, which he fondly hoped would be the means of restoring him to his wonted popularity, and pave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the increase of his power. He therefore submitted three different motions to the consideration of the house; but although in these motions he was ably supported, he was left in a minority.\n\nThe coalition ministry, as it was called, had still a considerable majority in parliament, notwithstanding the popularity belonging to the name and talents of Mr Pitt, but the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> bill was productive of a change. This bill owed its origin to Mr Burke, but it received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and systematical opposition from the ex-chancellor of the exchequer. It was carried, however, in the house of commons by a great majority, but in the house of lords it was opposed by the duke of Richmond, Lord Thurlow, and Earl Temple (afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a>); and on the 17th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1783, it was finally rejected by a majority of 19.\n\nThe king in the meantime determined on an entire change of administration, and the two secretaries were informed on the 18th of December 1783, about 12 o'clock at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> had no further occasion for their services. In consequence of this change, the important offices of first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer were bestowed on Mr Pitt, who thus became prime minister before he was full 24 years of age. Thurlow was created lord chancellor, the duke of Richmond keeper of the privy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>; the marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAERNARVON\">Caernarvon</a> then and Lord Sidney were chosen secretaries of state, and Mr Dundas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the navy.\n\nMuch about this time Mr Pitt brought forward a new bill for the better government of India. He proposed that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> of control should be instituted, the nomination of whose members was to be vested in the crown, and to them the dispatches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> were to be submitted. He also proposed that the appointment of the commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> should belong to his majesty, and having thus secured the political interests of the company, he left those of a commercial nature entirely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of directors. This bill, after a short debate, was rejected by a majority of eight. Such was the present temper of the house of commons, that a coalition or immediate dissolution became absolutely necessary; and the former having been unsuccessfully attempted, the latter was suddenly adopted, on the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1784. Mr Pitt having been returned for the university of Cambridge, again brought forward his bill in an amended state for the regulation of India, and carried it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> through both houses of parliament. The remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a> gave birth to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> for the better prevention of smuggling, and the commutation act, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of which certain duties were transferred from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a>.\n\nWhen Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDERMAN\">Alderman</a> Sawbridge (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 16th 1784) made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> for inquiring into the present state of the commons of Great Britain in parliament, Mr Pitt, whose political sentiments had undergone a revolution, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> himself considerably embarrassed, as he was reminded that he had brought forward questions on the same subject upon a former occasion. Mr Pitt, however, declined it, on account of the pressure of public business, and observed that, in his opinion, the present was not the proper time for bringing forward the question, and that it might be urged with greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success on some future occasion. He did not wish it to be discussed in a precipitate manner, yet the business itself should have every support he was able to afford it.\n\nHaving now attained the summit of power and influence as prime minister, Mr Pitt exercised every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of his important office, without any check or control. Possessed of a great majority in both houses of parliament, as well as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABINET\">cabinet</a>, his whole deportment, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of his opponents, seems to have become lofty in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>; and he paid little or no regard to that popularity which he had formerly courted.\n\nA commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> about this time was entered into with France, the terms of which have been generally acknowledged.\nacknowledged to be advantageous to Britain. Mr Pitt, who deserves great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> for giving the plan his countenance, adopted, much about the same time, another respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINANCES\">finances</a>, from which he derived a high degree of reputation; and, as he pointed at a period when the national debt might, in all probability, be extinguished, the country, if it was not altogether satisfied, appeared to be at least contented under his administration; and it is not a little to the credit of his financial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, that his opponents, when in power, not only approved, but adopted and extended it.\n\nIn this manner a commercial country began again to flourish, by turning its attention to the arts of peace; but, during his administration, its prosperity was threatened to be interrupted by the preparations for an attack upon Russia at one time, and by an open rupture with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> at another, relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOOTKA\">Nootka</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. In both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the blow was warded off by negotiation, and a good understanding restored. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of the tradeholder, by the intervention of a Prussian army, and his strenuous opposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>'s appointment to the regency during the king's indisposition, were also two important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> pursued and discussed in the course of his ministry.\n\nSoon after the commencement of the French revolution, Mr Pitt deemed a war with that country inevitable. But for a full detail of the events of this war, see BATTAIN. Having held the reins of government during 18 years, Mr Pitt, and all the members of the cabinet, suddenly retired from office in 1801. On this occasion all parties appeared to rejoice at the appointment of Mr Addington; and France, from that moment, as some affect, seemed to have neither friends nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the treaty of Amiens were debated in the house of commons, Mr Pitt defended the new minister with the whole force of his abilities and influence.\n\nOn the 15th of March 1804, Mr Pitt made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> attack on the administration; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> board was accused by him of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMBECILITY\">imbecility</a>. He zealously supported Mr Fox's proposition relative to the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> bill for the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, which was lost on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. The minister's majority having dwindled to 37, on the army of reserve suspension bill, Mr Addington and some of his friends retired, and the ex-minister resumed his former seat. When parliament met on the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1805, Mr Pitt warmly defended the war with Spain; and, on the motion for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, he had a majority of 207.\n\nBut, in the meantime, a gouty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, the predisposing causes of which appear to have been hereditary, and which, perhaps, was increased by his own manner of living, seized on a constitution never very strong. It is alleged, by his opponents, that this, combined with the miscarriage of his schemes, and the aspect of affairs on the continent, preyed so much upon his mind, that he is said to have died of a broken heart, at his house near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUTNEY\">Putney</a>, between four and five on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEDNESDAY\">Wednesday</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, January 23, 1806, in the 47th year of his age.\n\nAs a financier, no man has obtained more praise, who ever presided at the board of exchequer. During his ministry some of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> languished, but many flourished, and our exports were greatly increased. As a speaker he was unrivalled, and his generous scorn of wealth must be admired. In 20 years his debts amounted only to 40,000l. They were paid out of the public purse. The house of commons also passed a vote, that the expenses of his funeral, and a monument to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, should be defrayed by the nation.","sp":202,"ep":205},{"h":"PITTAUS","t":"a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITYLENE\">Mitylene</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LESBOS\">Lesbos</a>, was one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> wise men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>: his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> was Hyrradus. With the assistance of the sons of Alcaeus, he delivered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> from the oppression of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> Melanchrus; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which the Athenians waged against Lesbos, he appeared at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his countrymen, and challenged to single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> Phrynon, the enemy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>. As the event of the war seemed to depend upon this combat, Pittacus had recourse to artifice; and when he engaged, he entangled his adversary in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> which he had concealed under his shield, and easily dispatched him. He was amply rewarded for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>; and his countrymen, sensible of his merit, unanimously appointed him governor of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> with unlimited authority. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> Pittacus behaved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> moderation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>; and after he had governed his fellow-citizens with the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and after he had established and enforced the most salutary laws, he voluntarily resigned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> power after having enjoyed it for 10 years, observing, that the virtues and innocence of private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the power and influence of a sovereign. His disinterestedness gained him many admirers; and, when the Mitylenians wished to reward his public services by presenting him with an immense tract of territory, he refused to accept more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> than what should be contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> to which he could throw a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a>.

It was considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, and as a remedy, according to its different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> concerning this caterpillar, is derived from M. Reaumur, who has attentively observed its manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The animal cannot bear much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and is therefore never found in the higher latitudes. It is styled procectionary, because it never leaves its hold, where many families reside, till the evening, when it feeds in trains, led <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three, and this train leaves a ribbon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; for those behind follow exactly the steps of those which preceded, and each leaves its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of silk. Their nests are found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>; they are produced in the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, become torpid in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, and recover their strength again in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. They then descend from the trees, plunge into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and undergo their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> change. It is the bombix pityocampa of Fabricius, (Manissa Insector, tom. ii. p. 114, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 66.), and greatly resembled the procectionary caterpillar of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> used it as a vesicatory, and the acrimony seems to reside chiefly in a dust which is concealed in receptacles on its back. This is its offensive weapon, for it is thrown out at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and produces very troublesome effects, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> of the animal and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of its body seem to have a similar, but weaker power. The effect is also weaker in winter; but this may depend on the diminished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as on the torpid state of the insect. Their silk is not sufficiently strong for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOM\">loom</a>, and in hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> melts almost to a paste. In the earth it forms nests of stronger silk, but it is then found with difficulty: in boxes its silk is extremely tender. Adding to all these inconveniences, handling the cones produces all the bad effects of the dust. Matthiolus recommends them as a styptic, and perhaps they may serve for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> on the skin instead of moxa, the downy silk of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTEMISIA\">artemisia</a>.

His mother Victoria Forteguerra, when she was with child of him, dreamed that she should be delivered of a mitred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>; and as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of degrading clergymen at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was by crowning them with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> mitre, she believed that Aeneas would be a disgrace to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. But what to her had the appearance of being a disgrace, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a> of the greatest honors. Aeneas was carefully educated, and made considerable proficiency in the belles lettres. After ha-\nPius ving finished his studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>, he went in 1431 to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALE\">Bale</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Capranica, named De <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FERMO\">Fermo</a>, because he was entrusted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. Aeneas was his secretary, and was then only 26 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. He afterwards acted in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> to some other prelates, and to Cardinal Albergati. The council of Bale honoured him with different commissions, in order to recompense him for the zeal with which he defended that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> against Pope Eugene IV. He was afterwards secretary to Frederic III, who decreed to him the poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, and sent him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> to Rome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and other places. Nicholas V advanced him to the bishopric of Trieite, which he quitted some time after for that of Sienna. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, after having distinguished himself in various negotiations, he was invested with the Roman purple by Calixtus III, whom he succeeded two years after, on the 27th of August 1458. Pius II now advanced to the holy see, made good the proverb, Honores mutant mores. From the commencement of his pontificate, he appeared jealous of the papal prerogatives. In 1460 he issued a bull, \"declaring appeals from the pope to a council to be null, erroneous, detestable, and contrary to the sacred canons.\" That bull, however, did not prevent the procurator-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> from appealing to a council in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAGMATIC_SANCTION\">Pragmatic Sanction</a>, which the pope had strenuously opposed. Pius was then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, whither he had gone in order to engage the Catholic princes to unite in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> against the Turks. The greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them had agreed to furnish troops or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; others refused both, particularly France, who from that moment incurred his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>. That aversion abated under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XI, whom he persuaded in 1461 to abolish the Pragmatic Sanction, which the parliament of Paris had supported with so much vigour.\n\nThe following year 1462, was rendered famous by a controversy which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between the Cordeliers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a>, whether or not the blood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ was separated from his body while he lay in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. It was also made a question whether it was separated from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>. The Cordeliers affirmed that it was, but the Dominicans were of an opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. They called each other heretics; which obliged the pope to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> a bull, forbidding them under pain of censure to brand one another with such odious epithets. The bull which his holiness published on the 26th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, retracting what he had written to the council of Bale when he was its secretary, did not redound much to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. \"I am a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> (says he), and as a man I have erred. I am far from denying that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many things which I have said and written may deserve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a>. Like Paul, I have preached through deception, and I have persecuted the church of God through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>. I imitate the blessed Augustin, who having suffered some erroneous sentiments to creep into his works, retracted them. I do the same thing; I frankly acknowledge my ignorance, from a fear lest what I have written in my younger years should be the occasion of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> that might afterwards be prejudicial to the interests of the holy see. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be proper for any one to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> and support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the first throne of the church, it is in a peculiar manner my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, whom God, out of his mercy and goodness alone, without any merit on my part, has raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> of Jesus Christ. For all these reasons, we exhort and admonish you in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, not to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to those writings of ours which tend in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to hurt the authority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTOLIC\">apostolic</a> see, and which establish opinions that are not received by the Roman church. If you find, then, anything contrary to her doctrine, either in our dialogues, in our letters, or in other of our works, despite these opinions, reject them, and adopt our present sentiments. Believe me rather now that I am an old man, than when I addressed you in my earlier days. Esteem a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> pontiff more than a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; except against Aeneas Sylvius, but receive Pius II.\" It might be objected to his holiness, that it was his dignity alone which had made him alter his opinion. He anticipates that objection, by giving a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and actions, with the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the council of Bale, to which he went with Cardinal Capranica in 1431; \"but (says he) I was then a young man, and without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> come from its nest.\" In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the Turks were threatening Christendom. Pius, ever zealous in the defence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> against the infidels, forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of fitting out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at the expense of the church, and of passing over into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> himself, in order to animate the Christian princes by his example. He repaired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCONA\">Ancona</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to embark; but he there fell sick with the fatigue of the journey, and died on the 16th of August 1464, aged 59 years. Pius was one of the most learned men of his time, and one of the most zealous pontiffs; but being of an ambitious and pliant disposition, he sometimes sacrificed to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> works are, 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the council of Bale, from the suspension of Eugenius to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of Felix. 2.

The history of Frederic III, whose vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> he had been. This performance was published in 1785 in folio, and is believed to be pretty accurate and very particular. 5. A treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of children. 6.

(John Angel, Cardinal de Medicis), of a different family from that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, was born at Milan in 1499. He was son to Bernardin de Medechini, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> de Marignan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V.'s general. He raised himself by his own merit, and filled several important offices under Popes Clement VII. and Paul III. Julius III. who had entrusted him with several legations, honoured him with a cardinal's hat.\nhat in 1549. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Paul IV. he was advanced to St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> on the 23rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1559. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> had rendered himself detestable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who treated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> with every mark of indignity, and Pius IV. commenced his pontificate by pardoning them. He did not, however, extend the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> to the nephews of Pope Paul IV.; for he caused Cardinal Caraffe to be strangled in the cattle of St Angelo, and his brother, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> de Palliano, to be beheaded. His zeal was afterwards directed against the Turks and heretics. In order to stop, if possible, the progress of these last, he renewed the Council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, which had been suspended. He knew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> (says Abbe de Choisy), that that council might make some regulations which would have the effect to lessen his authority; but, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he perceived that great inconveniences might result from its not being assembled; and \"in the man (said he to his confidants) it is better to feel evil for once than to be always in dread of it.\" In 1561 he dispatched nuncios to all the Catholic and Protestant princes, to present them with the bull for calling that important assembly. An end was, however, put to it by the industry of his nephew, S. Charles Borromeus, in 1563; and, on the 26th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> the year following, he issued a bull for confirming its decrees. In 1565 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> was formed against his life by Benedict Acolti, and some other visionaries. Those madmen had taken it into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> that Pius IV. was not a lawful pope, and that after his death they would place another in St Peter's chair, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Pope Angelicus, under whom errors might be reformed, and peace restored to the church. The conspiracy was discovered, and the fanatic Benedict put to death. This pontiff died a little time after, on the 9th of December 1565, aged 66 years, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> to the grave with him the hatred of the Romans, whom his severity had exasperated. He was a man of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and very fruitful in his resources. He adorned Rome with several public edifices; but these ornaments tended greatly to impoverish it. If he was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of raising his relations in the world, it must be allowed, at least, that the greater part of them did him honour.\n\nPius V. (S. Michael Ghilieri), born at Bofchi or Bofco, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of Fortona, on the 17th of January 1504, was, according to Abb\u00e9 de Choisy, son to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATOR\">senator</a> of Milan. He turned a Dominican friar. Paul IV. informed of his merit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, gave him the bishopric of Sutri, created him cardinal in 1557, and made him inquisitor-general of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> among the Milanese and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>; but the severity with which he exercised his office obliged him to quit that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. He was sent to Venice, where the ardour of his zeal met with still greater obstacles. Pius IV. added to the cardinal's hat the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONDOVI\">Mondovi</a>. After the death of that pontiff, he was advanced to St Peter's chair in 1566. The Romans expressed but little joy at his coronation: he was very sensible of it, and said, \"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be as sorry at my death as they are at my election;\" but he was mistaken. Raised by his merit to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> preferment in Christendom, he could not divest himself of the severity of his character; and the situation in which he found himself rendered, perhaps, that severity necessary. One of his first objects was to repel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of the clergy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of the cardinals, and the licentious manners of the Romans. He caused the decrees of reformation enacted by the Council of Trent to be put in execution; he prohibited bull-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAITING\">baiting</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIRCUS\">Circus</a>; he expelled from Rome the women of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>; and allowed the cardinals to be prosecuted for their debts. The errors which overflowed the Christian world gave him great uneasiness. After having employed gentle and lenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECLAIMING\">reclaiming</a> of heretics, he had recourse to severity, and some of them ended their days in the flames of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>. He particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> his zeal for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of the holy see in 1568, by ordaining that the bull In coena domini, which was published at Rome every year on Maunday <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THURSDAY\">Thursday</a>, and which Clement XIV. suppressed, should be published likewise throughout the whole church. That bull, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of several sovereign pontiffs, principally regards the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical and civil power. It anathematizes those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> from the decrees of popes to a general council; those who favour the appellants; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> which teach that the pope is subject to a general council; the princes who would restrain the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, or who exact contributions from the clergy. It was rejected by all the sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, excepting a very few. In 1580, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> having endeavoured to introduce it into their dioceses, the parliament caused their temporalities to be seized upon, and declared those guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> who should imitate the fanaticism of those prelates. Pius V. for some time meditated an expedition against the Turks. He had the courage to make war on the Ottoman empire, by forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with the Venetians and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. This was the first time that the standard of the two keys was seen displayed against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a>. The naval armies came to an engagement, on the 7th of October 1571, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPANTO\">Lepanto</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, in which the confederate Christian princes obtained a signal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> over the Turks, who lost above 30,000 men, and near 200 galleys. This success was principally owing to the pope, who exhausted both his purse and person in fitting out that armament. He died of the gravel six months after, on the 30th of April 1572, aged 68. He repeated often, in the midst of his sufferings, \"O Lord! increase my pains and my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>.\" His name will forever adorn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of Roman pontiffs. It is true, that his bull against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, and his other bull in favour of the inquisition, with his rigorous prosecution of heretics both in France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, prove that he had more zeal than sweetness in his temper; but in other respects he possessed the virtues of a saint and the qualities of a king. He was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the famous Sixtus Quintus, to whom he gave an example of amassing in a few years such savings as were sufficient to make the holy see be regarded as a formidable power. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> Selim, who had no greater enemy than this pope, caused public rejoicings to be made at Constantinople for his death during the space of three days. The pontificate of Pius is also celebrated for the condemnation of Baius, the extinction of the order of Humilites, and the reformation of that of the Cistercians. He was canonized by Clement XI. in 1712. There are extant several of his letters, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a> in 1649, in 4to. Felibian, in 1672, published his Life, translated from the Italian of Agatio di Somma; but we cannot vouch for the fidelity of the translation.\nPIX.

Mr. Boyle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, thinks it originates from the effluvia or exhalations breathed into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> from noxious minerals, to which may be added stagnant waters and putrid bodies of every kind.\n\nMr. Gibbon thinks that the plague is derived from damp, hot, and stagnating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> of animal substances, especially locusts. See Gibbon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, 4to edit. vol. iv. p. 327\u2014332, where there is also a very particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the plague which depopulated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Julian.\n\nThe Mahometans believe that the plague proceeds from certain spirits, or goblins, armed with bows and arrows, sent by God to punish men for their sins; and that when the wounds are given by spectres of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, they certainly prove fatal, but not so when the arrows are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> by those that appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. They therefore take no precaution to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> themselves against it. The wisest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, however, at present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> otherwise; for we find a receipt recommended by Sidi Mohammed Zerroke, one of the most celebrated Marabouts, prefaced with these remarkable words: \"The lives of us all are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of God, when it is we must die. However, it hath pleased him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> many persons from the plague, by taking every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> rages, one pill or two of the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>; viz. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a> two parts, saffron one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, of aloes two parts, of syrup of myrtle berries, &c.\" But this remedy is confined to the more enlightened; for the bigotry of the lower sort is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> as to make them despise all precautions which people of other nations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Of this extreme and foolish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> Dr. Chandler gives an interesting account when speaking of the plague at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a>. This learned author is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the disease arises from animals, which he supposes to be invisible. See Chandler's Travels in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, p. 279, &c.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact, that plagues are sometimes partial, and that they only attack particular animals, or a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of persons, avoiding others altogether, or attacking them but lightly. Thus Ferneius informs us of a plague, or murrain, in 1514, which invaded only cats. Dionysius Halicarnaeus mentions a plague which attacked none but maids; and that which raged in the time of Gentius, killed scarcely any women, and very few but lusty men. Boterus mentions another plague, which assaulted none but the younger sort; and we have instances of the same kind of a later standing (a). Cardan speaks of a plague at Baille, with which the Switzers were infected, and the Italians, Germans, or French, exempted: and John Utenhovius takes notice of a dreadful one at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, which, though it raged among the Danes, spared the Germans, Dutch, and English, who went with all freedom, and without the least danger, to the houses of the infected. During the plague which ravaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> in 1760, it was observed that people of the fowdest constitutions were the most liable to it, and that the weak and delicate were either spared or easily cured. It was most fatal to the Moors; and, when it attacked them, it was generally incurable.\n\nWhen the plague raged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> in 1636, a young girl was seized with it, had three carbuncles, and was removed to a garden, where her lover, who was betrothed to her, attended her as a nurse, and slept with her as his wife. He remained uninfected, and the recovered, and was married to him. The story is related by Vine. Fabricius in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a>. Cur. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. II. Olst. 188.\n\nMany methods have been adopted in different countries to prevent the importation of this dreadful scourge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, and to stop the progress of infection after it has been imported. In England, mayors, bailiffs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> officers of corporations, and justices of peace, have power to tax inhabitants, houses, and lands, &c. within their precincts, for the relief of persons infected with the plague; and justices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> may tax persons within five miles round, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>'s inability; the tax to be levied by distress and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of goods, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFAULT\">default</a> thereof by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>. Infected persons going abroad, after being commanded to keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for avoiding farther infections, may be visited by watchmen, &c., and punished as vagrants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they have no fires upon them; and if they have infectious sores on them it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELONY\">felony</a>. Justices of the peace, &c., are to appoint searchers, examiners, and buriers of the dead, in places infected, and administer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> to them for the performance of their duties, &c.; flat. 1 Jac. I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 31. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUARANTINE\">QUARANTINE</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> having, in the year 1770, invented a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a>-powder, which, from several other experiments, had proved efficacious in preventing the infection of the plague; in order more fully to ascertain its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in that respect, it was determined,\n\n(a) See the account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> fever under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">PHILADELPHIA</a>, where it appears that the disease was less fatal to some sorts of persons than to others.\nPlague. determined, towards the end of the year, that ten malefactors under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> should, without undergoing any other precautions than the fumigations, be confined three weeks in a lazaretto, be laid upon the beds, and drestled in the clothes, which had been used by persons sick, dying, and even dead, of the plague in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>. The experiment was accordingly tried, and none of the ten malefactors were then infected, or have been since ill. The fumigation powder is prepared as follows.\n\nPowder of the first strength.] Take leaves of juniper, juniper-berries pounded, ears of wheat, guaiacum wood pounded, of each five pounds; common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a> pounded, eight pounds; sulphur pounded, five pounds; Smyrna <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAR\">tar</a>, or myrrh, two pounds: mix all the above ingredients together, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of the powder of fumigation of the first strength. [N.B. A pound is 40 pounds Russian, which are equal to 35 pounds and a half or 36 pounds English avoirdupoise.]\n\nPowder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> strength.] Take southernwood cut into small pieces, four pounds; juniper berries pounded, three pounds; common saltpetre pounded, four pounds; sulphur pounded, two pounds and a half; Smyrna tar, or myrrh, one pound and a half: mix the above together, which will produce half a pound of the powder of fumigation of the second strength.\n\nOdoriferous powder.] Take the root called kalmus cut into small pieces, three pounds; leaves of juniper cut into small pieces four pounds; frankincense pounded grossly, one pound; storax pounded, and rose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, half a pound; yellow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> pounded, one pound; common saltpetre pounded, one pound and a half; sulphur, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a pound: mix all the above together, which will produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pounds and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the odoriferous powder.\n\nRemark on the powder of fumigation.] If guaiacum cannot be had, the cones of pines or firs may be used in its stead; likewise common tar of pines and firs may be used instead of the Smyrna tar, or myrrh, and mugwort may supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of southernwood.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a>, who was himself infected, lib. ii. gives us an account of a dreadful plague which happened at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> about the year before Christ 430, while the Peloponnesians under the command of Archidamus waited all her territory abroad; but of these two enemies the plague was by far the most dreadful and severe.\n\nThe most dreadful plague that ever raged at Rome was in the reign of Titus, A.D. 80. The emperor left no remedy unattempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> the malignity of the distemper, acting during its continuance like a father to his people. The same fatal disease raged in all the provinces of the Roman empire in the reign of M. Aurelius, A.D. 167, and was followed by a dreadful famine, by earthquakes, inundations, and other calamities. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> believed that Ascalaphus sometimes entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, and cured the plague.\n\nAbout the year 430 the plague visited Britain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> after the Picts and Scots had made a formidable invasion of the southern part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. The plague raged with uncommon fury, and swept away most of those whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and famine had spared, so that the living were scarcely sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the dead.\n\nAbout the year 1348 the plague became almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many authors give an account of this plague, which is said to have appeared first in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Cathay in the year 1346, and to have proceeded gradually westward to Constantinople and Egypt. From Constantinople it passed into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, France, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and by degrees along the coasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> into Britain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and afterwards into Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> and the other northern kingdoms. According to Antoninus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> the distemper carried off 60,000 people in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, among whom was the historian John Villani.\n\nIn the year 1656 the plague was brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, being introduced into the city by a transport with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>. It raged with excessive violence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> off in less than six months 400,000 of the inhabitants. The distemper was at first called by the physicians a malignant fever; but one of them affirming it to be pestilential, the viceroy, who was apprehensive lest such a report would occasion all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with Naples to be broke off, was offended with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, and ordered him to be imprisoned. As a favour, however, he allowed him to return and die in his own house. By this proceeding of the viceroy, the distemper being neglected, made a most rapid and furious progress, and filled the whole city with consternation. The streets were crowded with confused processions, which served to spread the infection through all the quarters. The terror of the people increased their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>; and it being reported that a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">nun</a> had prophesied that the pestilence would cease upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HERMITAGE\">hermitage</a> for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a> upon the hill of St Martin's, the edifice was immediately begun with the most ardent zeal. Persons of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> strove who should perform the meanest offices; some loading themselves with beams, and others carrying baskets full of lime and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, while persons of all ranks stripped themselves of their most valuable effects, which they threw into empty hogheads placed in the streets to receive the charitable contributions. Their violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, however, and the increasing heats, diffused the malady through the whole city, and the streets and the stairs of the churches were filled with the dead; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of whom, for some time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, amounted daily to 15,000.\n\nThe viceroy now used all possible precautions to abate the fury of the distemper, and to prevent its spreading to the provinces. The infection, however, defoliated the whole kingdom, excepting the provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OTRANTO\">Otranto</a> and the Farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a>, and the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAETA\">Gaeta</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORRENTO\">Sorrento</a>, Paolo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELVEDERE\">Belvedere</a>. The general calamity was increased in Naples by malecontents, who infamated that the distemper had been designingly introduced by the Spaniards, and that there were people in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> who went through the city fowling poisoned dust. This idle rumour enraged the populace, who began to insult the Spanish soldiers, and threaten a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEDITION\">sedition</a>; so that the viceroy, to pacify the mob, caused a criminal to be broke upon the wheel, under pretence that he was a disperser of the dust. A violent and plentiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falling about the middle of August, the distemper began to abate; and on the eighth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> the physicians made a solemn declaration that the city was entirely free from infection.\n\nOf the dreadful plague which raged at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in\nthe year 1665, the reader will find an account in the article LONDON, No. 21. In 1720 the city of Marseille was visited with this destructive disease, brought in a ship from the Levant; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months, during which time it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, it carried off not less than 60,000 people. This defoliation is not yet obliterated from the minds of the inhabitants; some survivors remained alive but a few years ago to transmit a traditional account of it to after ages. There are two fine pictures, painted by Puget, representing some of the horrid scenes of that time. \"They are (says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Craven) only too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> executed. I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> several dying figures taking leave of their friends, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, anxious, kind, and watchful prayers on their sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, that made the tears flow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>. I was told the physicians and noblemen who were afflicting the sick and dying, were all portraits: I can easily conceive it; for in some faces there is a look of reflection and concern which could only be drawn from the life.\" Letters, p. 34, 35. This fatal event has caused the laws of quarantine to be very strictly enforced in the lazaretto here, which is an extensive insulated building.\n\nThe ravages of this disease have been dreadful wherever it has made its appearance. On the first arrival of the Europeans at the island of Gran Canaria, it contained 14,000 fighting men, soon after which, two thirds of the whole inhabitants fell a sacrifice to the plague, which had doubtless been introduced by their new visitors. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> it has made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> in Europe, and particularly in Constantinople, must be known to every reader; and its fatal effects have been particularly heightened there by that firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> which prevails among the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREDESTINATION\">predestination</a>, &c., as has been already mentioned. It is generally brought into European Turkey from Egypt; where it is very frequent, especially at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>. To give even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of all the plagues which have defoliated many flourishing countries, would extend this article beyond all bounds; and minutely to describe them all, would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. For the plague at Smyrna, we refer to Chandler's Travels as above. Relating that which raged in Syria in 1762, we refer to the Abb\u00e9 Mariti's Travels through Cyprus, Syria, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, vol. i. p. 278\u2014296. This plague was one of the most malignant and fatal that Syria ever experienced; for it scarcely made its appearance in any part of the body when it carried off the patient.\n\nIn addition to what the reader will find upon this subject in the article MEDICINE, and the observations which have now been offered, we beg leave to state the sentiments of Berthier on this subject, in his account of Bonaparte's expedition into Syria.\n\n\"At the time of our entry into Syria, (says he) all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> were infected by the plague; a malady which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and barbarity render so fatal in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>. Those who are affected by it give themselves up for dead; they are immediately abandoned by every body, and are left to die, when they might have been saved by medicine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">Citizen</a> Degenettes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> physician to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> a courage and character which entitle him to the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>. When our soldiers were attacked by the least fever, it was supposed that they had caught the plague, and these maladies were founded. The fever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> were abandoned by the officers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and their attendants. Citizen Degenettes repaired in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> to the hospitals, visited all the patients, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the glandular swellings, drested them, declared and maintained that the distemper was not the plague, but a malignant fever with glandular swellings, which might easily be cured by attention, and keeping the patient's mind easy.\"\n\nThe views of Degenettes in making this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> were worthy of the highest commendation; but Dr Mofley maintains that this fever was actually the plague. The physician, however, carried his courage so far, as to make two incisions, and to inoculate the suppuration <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> from one of these buboes above his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, and under his armpits, but was not affected with the malady. He thus eased the minds of the soldiers, the first step to a cure; and, by his fidelity and constant attendance in the hospitals, a number of men attacked with the plague were cured. His example was followed by other officers of health. \"There are, says Dr Mofley, annual or seasonal disorders, more or less severe, in all countries; but the plague, and other great depopulating epidemics, do not always obey the seasons of the year. Like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>, their course is eccentric. They have their revolutions; but from whence they come, or whether they go after they have made their revolution, no mortal can tell.\n\n\"Diseases originating in the atmosphere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> some, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> by others; and act exclusively on bodies graduated to receive their impressions; otherwise whole nations would be destroyed. In some constitutions of the body the access is easy, in some difficult, and in others impossible.\n\n\"The air of confined places may be so vitiated as to be unfit for the purposes of the healthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of any person. Hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-GAOL\">gaol</a>, hospital, and ship fevers. But, as these distempers are the offspring of a local cause, that local cause, and not the distempered people, communicate the disease.\n\n\"The infection, were it not in the atmosphere, would be confined within very narrow limits; have a determinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>; and none but physicians and attendants on the sick would suffer; and these must suffer; and the cause and the effects would be palpable to our senses. Upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the precaution of quarantine would be rational. But who then would visit and attend the sick, or could live in hospitals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>, and lazarettos?\"\n\nThe author is convinced from these reasonings, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUBO\">bubo</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARBUNCLE\">carbuncle</a>, of which we hear so much in Turkey, and read so much in our own history of plagues, arise from heating food and improper treatment; that they contain no infection; and consequently that they are not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> of the morbid virus separated from the contagion.\n\nSpeaking of the plague, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a> says, \"the first symptoms are said to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>; 2. Cephalalgia; 3. A stiff and uneasy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, with redness and tumour about the eyes; 4. Watering of the eyes; 5. White pustules on the tongue. Not uncommonly, all these have successively shown themselves, yet the patient has recovered; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, where suppuration has had place, the skin always remains discoloured, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> of a purple hue. Many who have been bled in an early stage of the disorder, have recovered without any fatal symptoms;\"\nsymptoms; but whether from that or any other cause, does not appear certain.\"\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">Oil</a> rubbed into the skin acts as a preventive, as well as a cure of the plague. When the operation is performed to prevent infection, it is successfully performed with that view at Smyrna, as often as the plague makes its appearance in the city. As it is not done for the purpose of promoting perspiration, it is not requisite that it should be performed with the same speed as when for curing the disorder; nor is it necessary to abstain from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, and to use soups; but it will be proper to use only fowls or veal for some days, without any seasoning. It will in fine be necessary to guard against indigestible food, and such liquors as might put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> or inflame the maws of the blood.\n\nThis interesting discovery merits the attention of all medical men; for if olive oil has been found efficacious in curing or preserving against one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of infection, it is not absurd to suppose, that the same or other kinds of oil might be productive of much benefit in other malignant infectious diseases.

The primary ones, called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> planets, are those which revolve round the sun as a centre; and the secondary planets, more usually called satellites <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> moons, are those which revolve round a primary planet as a centre, and constantly attend it in its revolution round the sun.\nThe primary planets are again distinguished into superior and inferior. The superior planets are those farther from the sun than our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, and the Georgium Sidus; and the inferior planets are those nearer the sun than our earth, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>. For an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the planets lately discovered, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESTA\">Vesta</a>.\n\nThat the planets are opaque bodies, like our earth, is thought probable for the following reasons. 1. Since in Venus, Mercury, and Mars, only that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the disk illuminated by the sun is found to shine; and again, Venus and Mercury, when between the earth and the sun, appear like dark spots or macules <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the sun's disk; it is evident, that Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are opaque bodies, illuminated with the borrowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of the sun. And the same appears of Jupiter, from its being void of light in that part to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of the satellites reaches, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as in that part turned from the sun; and that his satellites are opaque, and reflect the sun's light, is abundantly shown. Again, since Saturn, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> and satellites, only yield a faint light, fainter considerably than that of the fixed stars, though these be vastly more remote, and than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the planets; it is past doubt that he too with his attendants are opaque bodies. 2. Since the sun's light is not transmitted through Mercury and Venus, when placed against him, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> they are dense opaque bodies; which is likewise evident of Jupiter, from his hiding the satellites in his shadow; and therefore, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, the same may be concluded of Saturn. 3. From the variable spots of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, it is evident these planets have a changeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; which changeable atmosphere may, by a like argument, be inferred of the satellites of Jupiter; and therefore, by similitude, the same may be concluded of the other planets. 4. In like manner, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> observed in Venus, the same may be supposed in the other planets. 5. Since, then, Saturn, Jupiter, and the satellites of both, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are opaque bodies shining with the sun's borrowed light, are furnished with mountains, and encompassed with a changeable atmosphere; they have, it is concluded, waters, seas, &c. as well as dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and are bodies like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and therefore like the earth.

Of Seeds.] The seeds of plants are of various figures and sizes. Most of them are divided into two lobes; though some, as those of the cereals-kind, have five; and others, as the grains of corn, are not divided, but entire.\n\nBut as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> properties of all seeds are the same, when considered with regard to the principles of vegetation, our particular descriptions shall be limited to one seed, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> garden-bean. Neither is the choice of this seed altogether arbitrary; for, after it begins to vegetate, its parts are more conspicuous than many others, and consequently better calculated for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>.\n\nThis seed is covered with two coats <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> membranes. The outer coat is extremely thin, and full of pores; but may be easily separated from the inner one (which is much thicker), after the bean has been boiled, or lain a few days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. At the thick end of the bean there is a small hole visible to the naked eye, immediately over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> root, that it may have a free passage into the soil (fig. 1. A). When these coats are taken off, the body of the seed appears, which is divid-\ned into two smooth portions or lobes. The smoothness of the lobes is owing to a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> or cuticle with which they are covered.\n\nAt the basis of the bean is placed the radicle or future root (fig. 3. A). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the radicle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as it enters into the body of the feed, divides into two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> branches, one of which is inserted into each lobe, and sends off smaller ones in all directions through the whole substance of the lobes (fig. 4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">AA</a>). These ramifications become so extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> towards the edges of the lobes, that they require the finest glasses to render them visible. To these ramifications Grew and Malpighi have given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of seminal root; because, by means of it, the radicle and plume, before they are expanded, derive their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> nourishment.\n\nThe plume, bud, or germ (fig. 3.), is inclosed in two small corresponding cavities in each lobe. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and consistence is much the same with those of the radicle, of which it is only a continuation, but having a quite contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; for the radicle descends into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and divides into a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of smaller branches or filaments; but the plume ascends into the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and unfolds itself into all the beautiful variety of stem, branches, leaves, flower, fruit, &c. The plume in corn shoots from the smaller end of the grain, and amongst maltsters goes by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACROSPIRE\">acrospire</a>.\n\nThe next thing to be taken notice of is the substance or parenchymatous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the lobes. This is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> concreted juice, but is curiously organized, and consists of a vast number of small bladders resembling those in the pith of trees (fig. 5.).\n\nBesides the coats, cuticle, and parenchymatous parts, there is a substance perfectly distinct from these, distributed in different proportions through the radicle, plume, and lobes. This inner substance appears very plainly in a transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the radicle or plume. Towards the extremity of the radicle it is one entire trunk; but higher up it divides into three branches; the middle one runs directly up to the plume, and the other two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into the lobes on each side, and spread out into a great variety of small branches through the whole body of the lobes (fig. 4.). This substance is very properly termed the seminal root: for when the seed is sown, the moisture is first absorbed by the outer coats, which are everywhere furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> and air-vesicles; from these it is conveyed to the cuticle; from the cuticle it proceeds to the pulpy part of the lobes; when it has got thus far, it is taken up by the mouths of the small branches of the seminal root, and passes from one branch into another, till it is all collected into the main trunk, which communicates both with the plume and radicle, the two principal involved organs of the future plant. After this the sap or vegetable food runs in two opposite directions: part of it ascends into the plume, and promotes the growth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of that organ; and part of it descends into the radicle, for nourishing and evolving the root and its various filaments. Thus the plume and radicle continue their progress in opposite directions till the plant arrives at maturity.\n\nIt is here worth remarking, that every plant is really possessed of two roots, both of which are contained in the feed. The plume and radicle, when the seed is first deposited in the earth, derive their nourishment from the seminal root; but, afterwards, when the radicle begins to shoot out its filaments, and to absorb some moisture, not, however, in a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> to supply the exigencies of the plume, the two lobes, or main body of the feed, rise along with the plume, affuming the appearance of two leaves, resembling the lobes of the feed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and shape, but having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> resemblance to those of the plume, for which reason they have got the name of dissimilar leaves.\n\nThese dissimilar leaves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the young plume from the injuries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by absorbing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>, air, &c., assist the tender radicle in nourishing the plume, with which they have still a connection by means of the seminal root above described. But when the radicle or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> root has descended deep enough into the earth, and has acquired a sufficient number of filaments or branches for absorbing as much aliment as is proper for the growth of the plume; then the seminal or dissimilar leaves, their utility being entirely superfluous, begin to decay and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off.\n\nFig. 1.

The appearance of the radicle, plume, and seminal root, when a little further advanced in growth.\n\nHaving thus briefly described the feed, and traced its evolution into three principal organic parts, viz. the plume, radicle, and seminal leaves, we shall next take an anatomical view of the root, trunk, leaves, &c.\n\n2. Of the root.] In examining the root of plants, the first thing that presents itself is the skin, which is of various colours in different plants. Every root, after it has arrived at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> skin. The first is coeval with the other parts, and exists in the feed; but afterwards there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> sent off from the bark, and forms a second skin; e.g. in the root of the dandelion, towards the end of May, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> or outer skin appears shrivelled, and is easily separated from the new one, which is fresher, and adheres more firmly to the bark. Perennial plants are supplied in this manner with a new skin every year; the outer one always falls off in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> and winter, and a new one is formed from the bark in the succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. The skin has numerous cells or vesicles, and is a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle. However, it does not consist solely of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENCHYMA\">parenchyma</a>; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> shows that there are many tubular ligneous vessels interposed through it.\n\nWhen the skin is removed, the true cortical substance or bark appears, which is also a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle, but greatly augmented. The bark is of very different sizes. In most trees it is exceeding thin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the wood and pith. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARROTS\">carrots</a>, it is almost one-half of the semidiameter of the root; and, in dandelion, it is nearly twice as thick as the woody part.\nThe bark is composed of two substances; the parenchyma or pulp, which is the principal part, and a few woody fibres. The parenchyma is exceedingly porous, and has a great resemblance to a sponge; for it shrivels considerably when dried, and dilates to its former dimensions when infused in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. These pores or vessels are not pervious, so as to communicate with each other; but consist of distinct little cells or bladders, scarcely visible without the assistance of the microscope. In all roots, these cells are constantly filled with a thin watery liquor. They are generally of a spherical figure; though in some roots, as the bugloss and dandelion, they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>. In many roots, as the horseradish, peony, asparagus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-POTATO\">potato</a>, &c., the parenchyma is of one uniform structure. But in others it is more diversified, and puts on the shape of rays, running from the centre towards the circumference of the bark. These rays sometimes run quite through the bark, as in lovage; and sometimes advance towards the middle of it, as in melilot and most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGUMINOUS\">leguminous</a> and umbelliferous plants. These rays generally stand at an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from each other in the same plant; but the distance varies greatly in different plants. Neither are they of equal sizes: in carrot they are exceedingly small, and scarcely discernible; in melilot and chervil, they are thicker. They are likewise more numerous in some plants than in others. Sometimes they are of the same thickness from one edge of the bark to the other; and some grow wider as they approach to the skin. The vessels with which these rays are amply furnished, are supposed to be air-vessels, because they are always found to be dry, and not so transparent as the vessels which evidently contain the sap.\n\nIn all roots there are ligneous vessels dispersed in different proportions through the parenchyma of the bark. These ligneous vessels run longitudinally through the bark in the form of small threads, which are tubular, as is evident from the rising of the pith in them when a root is cut transversely. These ligneous sap-vessels do not run in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> through the bark, but at small distances incline towards one another, in such a manner that they appear to the naked eye to be inoculated; but the microscope discovers them to be only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a>, and braced together by the parenchyma. These braces or coagulations are very various both in size and number in different roots; but in all plants they are most numerous towards the inner edge of the bark. Neither are these vessels single tubes; but, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> in animals, are bundles of 20 or 30 small contiguous cylindrical tubes, which uniformly run from the extremity of the root, without sending off any branches or suffering any change in their size or shape.\n\nIn some roots, as parsnip, especially in the ring next the inner extremity of the bark, these vessels contain a kind of lymph, which is freer than the sap contained in the bladders of the parenchyma. From this circumstance they have got the name of lymph-ducks.\n\nThese lymph-ducks sometimes yield a mucilaginous lymph, as in the comfrey; and sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> milky glutinous lymph, as in the angelica, fennel, burdock, scorzonera, dandelion, &c. The lymph-ducks are supposed to be the vessels from which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> and balsams are secreted. The lymph of fennel, when exposed to the air, becomes a clear transparent balsam; and that of the scorzonera, dandelion, &c., condenses into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>.\n\nThe situation of the vessels is various. In some plants they stand in a ring or circle at the inner edge of the bark, as in asparagus; in others, they appear in lines or rays, as in borage; in the parsnip, and several other plants, they are most conspicuous towards the outer edge of the bark; and in the dandelion, they are disposed in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> circles.\n\nThe wood of roots is that part which appears after the bark is taken off, and is firmer and less porous than the bark or pith. It consists of two distinct substances, viz. the pulpy or parenchymatous, and the ligneous. The wood is connected to the bark by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portions of the bark inserted into it. These insertions are mostly in the form of rays, tending to the centre of the pith, which are easily discernible by the eye in a transverse section of most roots. These insertions, like the bark, consist of many vessels, mostly of a round or oval figure.\n\nThe ligneous vessels are generally disposed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> rows running longitudinally through the root. Some of these contain air, and others sap. The air-vessels are so called, because they contain no liquor. These air-vessels are distinguished by being whiter than the others.\n\nThe pith is the central part of the root. Some roots have no pith, as the stramonium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOTIANA\">nicotiana</a>, &c.; others have little or none at the extremities of the roots, but have a considerable quantity of it near the top. The pith, like every other part of a plant, is derived from the seed; but in some it is more immediately derived from the bark: for the insertions of the bark running in between the rays of the wood, meet in the centre, and constitute the pith. It is owing to this circumstance, that, among roots which have no pith in their lower parts, they are amply provided with it towards the top, as in columbine, lovage, &c.\n\nThe bladders of the pith are of very different sizes, and generally of a circular figure. Their position is more uniform than in the bark. Their sides are not mere films, but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of small fibres or threads; which gives the pith, when viewed with a microscope, the appearance of a piece of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nWe shall conclude the description of roots with observing, that their whole substance is nothing but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of tubes and fibres, adapted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of nourishment, and of course the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and augmentation of their parts.\n\nFig. 9. A transverse section of the root of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a> as it appears to the naked eye.\n\nFig. 10. A section of fig. 9, magnified. AA, the skin, with its vessels. BBBB, the bark. The round holes CCC, &c., are the lymph-ducks of the bark: All the other holes are little cells and sap-vessels. DDD, parenchymatous insertions from the bark, with the cells, &c. EEEE, the rays of the wood, in which the holes are the air-vessels. N.B. This root has no pith.\n\n3. Of the Trunk, Stalk, or Stem.] In describing the trunks of plants, it is necessary to premise, that whatever is said with regard to them applies equally to the branches.\n\nThe trunk, like the root, consists of three parts, viz. the bark, wood, and pith. These parts, though substantially the same in the trunk as in the root, are in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> very different in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> and appearance.\nThe skin of the bark is composed of very minute bladders, interspersed with longitudinal woody fibres, as in the nettle, thistle, and most herbs. The outside of the skin is visibly porous in some plants, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>.\n\nThe principal body of the bark is composed of pulp or parenchyma, and innumerable vessels much larger than those of the skin. The texture of the pulpy part, though the same substance with the parenchyma in roots, yet seldom appears in the form of rays running towards the pith; and when these rays do appear, they do not extend above half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the circumference. The vessels of the bark are very differently situated, and defined for various purposes in different plants. For example, in the bark of the pine, the innermost are lymph-ducts, and exceedingly small; the outermost are gum or resiniferous vessels, destined for the secretion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>; and are so large as to be distinctly visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe wood lies between the bark and pith, and consists of two parts, viz. a parenchymatous and a ligneous. In all trees, the parenchymatous part of the wood, though much diversified as to size and consistence, is uniformly disposed in diametrical rays, or insertions running between similar rays of the ligneous part.\n\nThe true wood is nothing but a congeries of old dried lymph-ducts. Between the bark and the wood a new ring of these ducts is formed every year, which gradually loses its softness as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> season approaches, and towards the middle of winter is condensed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> ring of wood. These annual rings, which are distinctly visible in most trees when cut through, serve as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> marks to distinguish their age (fig. ii, i2.). The rings of one year are sometimes larger, sometimes less, than those of another, probably owing to the favourable or unfavourable effects of the season.\n\nThe pith, though of a different texture, is exactly of the same substance with the parenchyma of the bark, and the insertions of the wood. The quantity of pith is various in different plants. Instead of being increased every year like the wood, it is annually diminished, its vessels drying up, and affuming the appearance and structure of wood; insomuch that in old trees there is scarce such a thing as pith to be discerned.\n\nA ring of sap-vessels is usually placed at the outer edge of the pith, next the wood. In the pine, fig, and walnut, they are very large. The parenchyma of the pith is composed of small cells or bladders, of the same kind with those of the bark, only of a larger size. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> figure of these bladders is circular; though in some plants, as the thistle and borage, they are angular. Though the pith is originally one connected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of bladders, yet as the plant grows old they shrivel, and open in different directions. In the walnut, after a certain age, it appears in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> transverse hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. In some plants it is altogether wanting; in others, as the fennel, nettle, &c., there is only a transverse partition of it at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>. Many other varieties might be mentioned; but these must be left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the reader.\n\nFig. ii. A transverse section of a branch of ash, as it appears to the eye.\n\nFig. i2. The same section magnified. AA, the bark. BBB, an arched ring of sap-vessels next the skin. CCC, the parenchyma of the bark with its cells, and another arched ring of sap-vessels. DD, a circular line of lymph-ducts immediately below the above arched ring. EE, the wood.

MMM, the parenchymatous insertions of the bark represented by the white rays. NO, the pith, with its bladders or cells.\n\n4. Of the Leaves.] The leaves of plants consist of the same substance with that of the trunk. They are full of nerves or woody portions, running in all directions, and branching out into innumerable small threads, interwoven with the parenchyma like fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a> or gauze.\n\nThe skin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, like that of an animal, is full of pores, which both serve for perspiration and for the absorption of dew, air, &c. These pores or orifices differ both in shape and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> in different plants, which is the cause of that variety of texture or grain peculiar to every plant.\n\nThe pulpy or parenchymatous part consists of very minute fibres, wound up into small cells or bladders. These cells are of various sizes in the same leaf.\n\nAll leaves, of whatever figure, have a marginal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, by which all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> are bounded. The particular shape of this fibre determines the figure of the leaf.\n\nThe vessels of leaves have the appearance of inoculating; but, when examined by the microscope, they are found only to be interwoven or laid along each other.\n\nWhat are called air-vessels, or those which carry no sap, are visible even to the naked eye in some leaves. When a leaf is slowly broken, they appear like small woolly fibres, connected to both ends of the broken piece.\n\nPlate Fig. i3. The appearance of the air-vessels to the eye, CCCXXI.\n\nPlate Fig. i4. A small piece cut off that leaf.\n\nPlate Fig. i5. The same piece magnified, in which the vessels have the appearance of acrew.\n\nPlate Fig. i6. The appearance of these vessels as they exist in the leaf before they are stretched out.\n\n5. Of the Flower.] It is needless here to mention any thing of the texture, or of the vessels, &c., of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, as they are pretty similar to those of the leaf. It would be foreign to our present purpose to take any notice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> and distinctions of flowers. These belong to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>, to which the reader is referred.\n\nThere is one curious fact, however, which must not be omitted, viz. That every flower is perfectly formed in its parts many months before it appears outwardly; that is, the flowers which appear this year are not properly speaking the flowers of this year, but of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>. For example, mezzereon generally flowers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>; but these flowers were completely formed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of August preceding. Of this fact any one may satisfy himself by separating the coats of a tulip root about the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>; and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find that the two innermost form a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>, in the centre of which stands the young flower, which is not to make its appearance till the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> or May. Fig. i8. exhibits a view of the tulip-root when dissected in September, with the young flower towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>.\n\n6. Of the Fruit.] In describing the structure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>,\nA few examples shall be taken from such as are most generally known.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a>, besides the skin, which is a production of the skin of the bark, consists of a double parenchyma or pulp, sap, and air-vesicles, calcareous and acetylic.\n\nThe outer parenchyma is the same substance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> from the bark, only its bladders are larger and more succulent.\n\nIt is everywhere interspersed with small globules or grains, and the bladders reflect these grains as a kind of centres, every grain being the centre of a number of bladders. The sap and air-vesicles in this pulp are extremely small.\n\nNext the core is the inner pulp or parenchyma, which consists of bladders of the same kind with the outer, only larger and more oblong, corresponding to those of the pulp, from which it seems to be derived. This inner pulp is much sooner than the other, and has none of the small grains interspersed through it; and hence it has got the name of acetylic.\n\nBetween the acetylic and outer pulp, the globules or grains begin to grow larger, and gradually unite into a hard stony body, especially towards the corculum or stool of the fruit; and from this circumstance it has been called the calcareous.\n\nThese grains are not derived from any of the organic parts of the tree; but seem rather to be a kind of concretions precipitated from the sap, similar to the precipitation from wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, and other liquors.\n\nThe core is a roundish cavity in the centre of the pear, lined with a hard woody membrane, in which the seed is inclosed. At the bottom of the core there is a small duct or canal, which runs up to the top of the pear; this canal allows the air to get into the core, for the purpose of drying and ripening the seeds.\n\nFig. 18, a transverse section of a pear, as it appears to the naked eye. A, the skin, and a ring of sap-vesicles. B, the outer parenchyma, or pulp, with its vesicles, and ligneous fibres interspersed. C, the inner parenchyma, or acetylic, with its vesicles, which are larger than the outer one. D, the core and seeds.\n\nFig. 19, a piece cut off, fig. 19.\n\nFig. 20, is fig. 19, magnified. A A A, the small grains or globules, with the vesicles radiated from them.\n\nFig. 21, a longitudinal section of the pear, showing a different view of the same parts with those of fig. 18. A the channel, or duct, which runs from the top of the pear to the bottom of the core.\n\nIn a lemon, the parenchyma appears in three different forms. The parenchyma of the rind is of a coarse texture, being composed of thick fibres, woven into large bladders. Those nearest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> contain the essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of the fruit, which bursts into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> when the skin is squeezed over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. From this outmost parenchyma <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten infusions or lamellae are produced, which run between as many portions of the pulp, and unite into one body in the centre of the fruit, which corresponds to the pith in trunks or roots. At the bottom and top of the lemon, this pith evidently joins with the rind, without the intervention of any lamellae. This circumstance shows, that the pith and bark are actually connected in the trunk and roots of plants, though it is difficult to demonstrate the connection, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the closeness of their texture, and the minuteness of their fibres. Many vesicles are dispersed through the whole of this parenchyma; but the largest ones stand on the inner edge of the rind, and the outer edge of the pith, just at the two extremities of each lamella.\n\nThe second kind of parenchyma is placed between the rind and the pith; is divided into distinct bodies by the lamellae; and each of these bodies forms a large bag.\n\nThese bags contain a third parenchyma, which is a cluter of smaller bags, distinct and unconnected with each other, having a small stalk by which they are fixed to the large bag. Within each of these small bags are many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of bladders, composed of extremely minute fibres. These bladders contain the acid juice of the lemon.\n\nFig. 22, a longitudinal section of a lemon. A A A, the rind with the vesicles which contain the essential oil. B B, the substance corresponding to the pith, formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the lamellae or infusions.

B B B, &c., the nine pulpy bags, or second parenchyma, placed between the rind and the pith; and the cluter of small bags, which contain the acid juice, inclosed in the large ones. C C, the large vesicles that surround the pith. D D, two of the large bags laid open, showing the seeds, and their connection with the lamellae or membranes which form the large bags.\n\nOf the Perpiration of Plants, and the quantity of moisture daily imbibed by them.\u2014These curious particulars have been determined with great accuracy by Dr Hales. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> he took to accomplish his purpose was as follows.\u2014In the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> the warmest season of the year, he took a large sunflower three feet and an half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, which had been purposely planted in a flower-pot when young. He covered the pot with thin milled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, leaving only a small hole to preserve a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, and another by which he might occasionally supply the plant with water. Into the former he inserted a glass tube nine inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and another shorter tube into the hole by which he poured in the water; and the latter was kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> stoppered with a cork, except when there was occasion to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> it. The holes in the bottom of the pot were also stoppered up with corks, and all the crevices filled with cement.\u2014Things being thus prepared, the pot and plant were weighed for several days; after which the plant was cut off close to the leaden plate, and the flump <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> covered with cement. By weighing, he found that there perpired through the unglazed porous pot two ounces every 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; which being allowed for in the daily weighing of the plant and pot, the greatest perspiration, in a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, was found to be one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> 14 ounces; the middle rate of perspiration, one pound four ounces; the perspiration of a dry warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, without any sensible dew, was about three ounces; but when there was any sensible though small dew, the perspiration was nothing; and when there was a large dew, or some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> in the night, the plant and pot was increased in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> two or three ounces.\n\nIn order to know what quantity was perspired from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> of surface, our author cut off all the leaves of the plant, and laid them in five several parcels, according to their several sizes; and then measured the surface of a leaf of each parcel, by laying over it a large lattice.\nlattice made with threads, in which each of the little squares was \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch; by numbering of which, he had the surface of the leaves in square inches; which, multiplied by the number of leaves in the corresponding parcels, gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of all the leaves. By this method he found the surface of the whole plant above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> to be 5616 square inches, or 39 square feet. He dug up another sunflower of nearly the same size, which had eight main roots, reaching 15 inches deep and sidewise, from the stem. It had besides a very thick bush of lateral roots from the eight main roots, extending every way in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a> about nine inches from the stem and main roots. In order to estimate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of all the roots, he took one of the main roots with its laterals, and measured and weighed them; and then weighed the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> with their laterals; by which means he found the sum of all their lengths to be 1448 feet.\n\nSupposing then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of these roots at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> to be 0.131 of an inch, then their surface will be 2276 square inches, or 15.8 square feet; that is, equal to 0.4 of the surface of the plant above ground. From calculations drawn from these observations, it appears, that a square inch of the upper surface of this plant perspires \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) part of an inch in a day and a night; and that a square inch of the surface underground imbibes \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch in the same time.\n\nThe quantity perspired by different plants, however, is by no means equal. A vine-leaf perspires only \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch in 12 hours; a cabbage perspires \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch in the same time; an apple-tree \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) in 12 hours; and a lemon \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) in 12 hours.\n\nOf the circulation of the Sap in PLANTS.\u2014Concerning this there have been great disputes; some maintaining, that the vegetable sap has a circulation analogous to the blood of animals; while others affirm, that it only ascends in the day-time, and descends again in the night. In favour of the doctrine of circulation it has been urged, that upon making a transverse incision into the trunk of a tree, the juice which runs out proceeds in greater quantity from the upper than the lower part; and the swelling in the upper lip is also much greater than in the lower. It appears, however, that when two similar incisions are made, one near the top and the other near the root, the latter expends much more sap than the former. Hence it is concluded, that the juice ascends by one set of vessels and descends by another. But, in order to show this clearly, it would be necessary first to prove that there is in plants, as in animals, some kind of centre from which the circulation begins, and to which it returns; but no such centre has been discovered by any naturalist; neither is there the least provision apparently made by nature whereby the sap might be prevented from descending in the very same vessels through which it ascends. In the lacteal vessels of animals, which we may suppose to be analogous to the roots of vegetables, there are valves which effectually prevent the chyle when once absorbed from returning into the intestines; but no such thing is observed in the vessels of vegetables; whence it must be very probable, that when the propelling force ceases, the juice descends by the very same vessels through which it ascended.\u2014This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, however, has been cleared up almost as well as the nature of the subject will admit of by the experiments of Dr Hales. These experiments are so numerous, that for a particular account of them we must refer to the work itself; however, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> against the circulation of the sap will be sufficiently intelligible without them. \"We see (says he), in many of the foregoing experiments, what quantities of moisture trees daily imbibe and perspire: now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a> of the sap must be very great, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> that quantity of moisture must, most of it, ascend to the top of the tree, then descend, and ascend again, before it is carried off by perspiration.\n\n\"The defect of a circulation in vegetables seems in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to be supplied by the much greater quantity of liquor, which the vegetable takes in, than the animal, whereby its motion is accelerated; for we find the sunflower, bulk for bulk, imbibes and perspires 17 times more fresh liquor than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, every 24 hours.\n\n\"Besides, Nature's great aim in vegetables being only that the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> be carried on and maintained, there was no occasion to give its sap the rapid motion which was necessary for the blood of animals.\n\n\"In animals, it is the heart which sets the blood in motion, and makes it continually circulate; but in vegetables we can discover no other cause of the sap's motion but the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> sap-vessels, afflited by the brisk undulations and vibrations caused by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s warmth, whereby the sap is carried up to the top of the tallest trees, and is there perspired off through the leaves: but when the surface of the tree is greatly diminished by the loss of its leaves, then also the perspiration and motion of the sap is proportionably diminished, as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from many of the foregoing experiments: so that the ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the sap is principally accelerated by the plentiful perspiration of the leaves, thereby making room for the fine capillary vessels to exert their vastly attracting power, which perspiration is effected by the brisk rarefying vibrations of warmth; a power that does not seem to be any ways well adapted to make the sap defend from the tops of vegetables by different vessels to the root.\n\n\"If the sap circulated, it must needs have been seen descending from the upper part of large gashes cut in branches let in water, and with columns of water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> on their bottoms in long glass tubes. In both which cases it is certain that great quantities of water passed through the stem, so that it must needs have been seen descending, at the return of the sap downwards were by trufion or pulsion, whereby the blood in animals is returned through the veins to the heart; and that pulsion if there were any, must necessarily be exerted with prodigious force, to be able to drive the sap through the finer capillaries. So that, if there be a return of the sap downwards, it must be by attraction, and that a very powerful one, as we may see by many of these experiments. But it is hard to conceive what and where that power is which can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to that provision nature has made for the ascent of the sap in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the great perspiration of the leaves.\n\n\"The instances of the jasmine-tree, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>-tree, have been looked upon as strong proofs of the circulation of the sap, because their branches, which were far below the inoculated bud, were gilded: but we have many visible proofs in the vine, and other bleeding trees, of the sap's receding back, and pushing forwards alternately, at different times of the day and night. And there is great reason to think that the sap of all other trees, has such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a>, receding, and progressive motion, occasioned by the alternacies of day and night, warm and cool, moist and dry.\"\n\"For the sap in all vegetables does probably recede in some measure from the tops of the branches, as the sun leaves them; because its rarefying power then ceasing, the greatly rarefied sap, and air mixed with it, will condense, and take up less room than they did, and the dew and rain will then be strongly imbibed by the leaves; whereby the body and branches of the vegetable which have been much exhausted by the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> of the day, may at night imbibe sap and dew from the leaves; for by several experiments, plants were found to increase considerably in weight, in dewy and moist nights. And by other experiments on the vine, it was found that the trunk and branches of vines were always in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMBIBING\">imbibing</a> state, caused by the great perpiration of the leaves, except in the bleeding season; but when at night that perspiring power ceases, then the contrary imbibing power will prevail, and draw the sap and dew from the leaves, as well as moisture from the roots.\n\n\"And we have a farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this by fixing mercurial gages to the stems of several trees which do not bleed, whereby it is found that they are always in a strongly imbibing state, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> several inches: whence it is easy to conceive, how some of the particles of the gilded bud in the inoculated jefamaine may be absorbed by it, and thereby communicate their gilding miasmata to the sap of other branches; especially when, some months after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a>, the stock of the inoculated jefamaine is cut off a little above the bud; whereby the stock, which was the counteracting part to the stem, being taken away, the stem attracts more vigourously from the bud.\n\n\"Another argument for the circulation of the sap is, that some sorts of the grafts will infect and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANKER\">canker</a> the stocks they are grafted on: but by mercurial gages fixed to fresh-cut stems of trees, it is evident that those stems were in a strongly imbibing state; and consequently the cankered stocks might very likely draw sap from the graft, as well as the graft alternately from the stock; just in the same manner as leaves and branches do from each other, in the vicissitudes of day and night. And this imbibing power of the stock is so great, where only some of the branches of a tree are grafted, that the remaining branches of the stock will, by their strong attraction, starve those grafts; for which reason it is usual to cut off the greatest part of the branches of the stock, leaving only a few small ones to draw up the sap.\n\n\"The influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ILEX\">ilex</a> grafted upon the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>, seems to afford a very considerable argument against a circulation. For, if there were a free uniform circulation of the sap through the oak and ilex, why should the leaves of the oak fall in winter, and not those of the ilex?\n\n\"Another argument against an uniform circulation of the sap in trees, as in animals, may be drawn from an experiment, where it was found by the three mercurial gages fixed to the same vine, that while some of its branches changed their state of protruding sap into a state of imbibing, others continued protruding sap; one nine, and the other thirteen days longer.\"\n\nTo this reasoning of Dr Hales we shall subjoin an experiment made by Mr Muffel of the Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a>, which seems decisive against the doctrine of circulation. His account of it is as follows.\u2014\"On the 12th of January I placed several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> in pots against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a> of my hot-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, some within the house and others without it. Through holes made for this purpose in the panes of glass, I placed a branch of each of the shrubs, so that those in the inside had a branch without, and those on the outside one within; after this, I took care that the holes should be exactly closed and luted. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> experiment, I thought, if followed closely, could not fail affording sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, to trace out the differences, by the observation of the effects.\n\n\"The 20th of January, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> after this disposition, all the branches that were in the hot-house began to disclose their buds. In the beginning of February there appeared leaves; and towards the end of it, shoots of a considerable length, which presented the young flowers. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a> apple-tree, and several rose-trees, being submitted to the same experiment, showed the same appearance then as they commonly put on in May; in short, all the branches which were within the hot-house, and consequently kept in the warm air, were green at the end of February, and had their shoots in great forwardness. Very different were those parts of the same tree which were without and exposed to the cold. None of these gave the least sign of vegetation; and the frosts, which was intense at that time, broke a rose-pot placed on the outside, and killed some of the branches of that very tree which, on the inside, was every day putting forth more and more shoots, leaves, and buds, so that it was in full vegetation on one side, whilst frozen on the other.\n\n\"The continuance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> occasioned no change in any of the internal branches. They all continued in a very brisk and verdant state, as if they did not belong to the tree which, on the outside, appeared in the state of the greatest suffering. On the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, notwithstanding the severity of the frost, all was in full bloom. The apple-tree had its root, its stem, and part of its branches, in the hot-house. These branches were covered with leaves and flowers; but the branches of the same tree, which were carried on the outside, and exposed to the cold air, did not in the least partake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the rest, but were absolutely in the same state which all trees are in during winter. A rose-tree, in the same position, showed long shoots with leaves and buds; it had even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> a vigorous branch upon its stalk; whilst a branch which passed through to the outside had not begun to produce anything, but was in the same state with other rose-trees left in the ground. This branch is four lines in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and 18 inches high.\n\n\"The rose-tree on the outside was in the same state; but one of its branches drawn through to the inside of the hot-house was covered with leaves and rose-buds. It was not without astonishment that I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> this branch shoot as briskly as the rose-tree which was in the hot-house, whose roots and stalk, exposed as they were to the warm air, ought, it should seem, to have made it get forward than a branch belonging to a tree, whose roots, trunk, and all its other branches, were at the very time frost-nipped. Notwithstanding this, the branch did not seem affected by the state of its trunk; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> upon it produced the same effect as if the whole tree had been in the hot-house.\"\n\nMemoires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.\naffection of perpendicularity observed in the stems or stalks of all plants, in the roots of many, and even in their branches, as much as possible. Though almost all plants rise a little crooked, yet the stems shoot up perpendicularly, and the roots hang <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> perpendicularly; even those, which by the declivity of the soil come out inclined, or those which are diverted out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> by any violent means, again redress and straighten themselves and recover their perpendicularity, by making a second and contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELBOW\">elbow</a> without rectifying the first. We commonly look upon this affection without any surprize; but the naturalist who knows what a plant is, and how it is formed, finds it a subject of astonishment.\n\nEach seed we know contains in it a little plant, already formed, and needing nothing but to be unfolded; the little plant has its root; and the pulp, which is usually separated into two lobes, is the foundation of the first food it draws by its root when it begins to germinate. If a seed in the earth therefore be disposed so as that the root of the little plant be turned downwards, and the stem upwards, and even perpendicularly upwards, it is easy to conceive that the little plant coming to unfold itself, its stalk and root need only follow the direction they have to grow perpendicularly. But we know that the seeds of plants, whether thrown of themselves or by man, fall in the ground at random; and among the great variety of situations with regard to the stalk of their plant, the perpendicular one upwards is but one. In all the rest, therefore, it is necessary that the stalk rectify itself, so as to get out of the ground: but what force effects this change, which is unquestionably a violent action? Does the stalk find a less load of earth above it, and therefore go naturally that way where it finds the least obstacle? Were this so, the little root, when it happens to be uppermost, must also follow that direction, and mount up.\n\nTo account for two such different actions, M. Dodart supposes that the fibres of the stalks are of such a nature, as to be contracted and shortened by the heat of the sun, and lengthened out by the moisture of the earth; and, on the contrary, that the fibres of the roots are contracted by the moisture of the earth, and lengthened by the heat of the sun. When the plantule therefore is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, and the root at the top, the fibres which compose one of the branches of the root are not alike exposed to the moisture of the earth, the lower part being more exposed than the upper. The lower must of course <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> the most; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> is again promoted by the lengthening of the upper, whereon the fun acts with the greatest force. This branch of the root must therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> towards the earth, and, infusing through the pores thereof, must get underneath the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a>, &c. By inverting this reasoning we discover how the stalk comes to get uppermost.\n\nWe suppose then that the earth attracts the root to itself, and that the sun contributes to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>; and, on the other hand, that the sun attracts the stem, and the earth contributes to send it towards the same. With respect to the straightening of the stalks in the open air, our author imagines that it arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of external causes, particularly the sun and rain. For the upper part of a stalk that is bent is more exposed to the rain, dew, and even the sun, &c. than the under; and these causes, in a certain structure of the fibres, both equally tend to straighten the part most exposed by the shortening they successively occasion in it; for moisture shortens by dwelling and heat by dilating. What that structure is which gives the fibres such different qualities, or whereon it depends, is a mystery as yet beyond our depth.\n\nM. de la Hire accounts for the perpendicularity of the stems or stalks of plants in this manner: he supposes that the root of plants draws a coarser and heavier juice, and the stem and branches a finer and more volatile one. Most naturalists indeed conceive the root to be the stomach of the plant, where the juices of the earth are utilized as to become able to rise through the stem to the extremity of the branches. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of juices supposes larger pores in the roots than the stalk, &c., and, in a word, a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCRETION\">concretion</a>. This difference must be found even in the little invisible plant included in the seed; in it, therefore, we may conceive a point of separation; such as, that all on one side, for example the root, shall be unfolded by the groter juices, and all on the other side by the more subtle ones. Suppose the plantule, when its parts begin to unfold, to be entirely inverted, the root at the top, and the stalk below; the juices entering the root will be coarser, and when they have opened and enlarged the pores so as to admit juices of a determinate weight, those juices prefilling the root more and more will drive it downwards; and this will increase as the root is more extended or enlarged: for the point of separation being conceived as the fixed point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> by the longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>. The volatile juices at the same time having penetrated the stalk, will give it a direction from below upwards; and, by reason of the lever, will give it more and more every day. The little plant is thus turned on its fixed point of separation till it become perfectly erect.\n\nWhen the plant is thus erected, the stalk should still rise perpendicularly, in order to give it the more firm biding, and enable it to withstand the effort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and weather. M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a> thus accounts for this effect: If the nutritious juice which arrived at the extremity of a rising stalk evaporate, the weight of the air which encompasses it on all sides will make it ascend vertically; but if, instead of evaporating, it congeal, and remain fixed to that extremity whence it was ready to go off, the weight of the air will give it the same direction; so that the stalk will have acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> new part vertically laid over it, just as the flame in a candle held in any way obliquely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> still continues vertical by the prelure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. The new drops of juice that succeed will follow the same direction; and as all together form the stalk, that must of course be vertical, unless some particular circumstance intervene.\n\nThe branches, which are at first supposed to proceed laterally out of the stalk in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> of the plant, though they should even come out in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> direction, must also raise themselves upwards by the constant direction of the nutritious juice, which at first scarcely meets any resistance in a tender supple branch; and afterwards, even though the branch grow more firm, it will act with the more advantage; since the branch, being become longer, furnishes it with a longer arm or lever. The slender action of even a little drop becomes very considerable by its continuity, and by the assistance of such circumstances. Hence may we account for that regular situation and direction of the branches,\nbranches, since they all make nearly the same constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of $45^\\circ$ with the stem, and with one another.\n\nM. Alltruc accounts for the perpendicularity of the stems, and their reduplicating themselves, thus: 1. He thinks the nutritious juice arises from the circumference of the plant, and terminates in the pith; And, 2. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, contained in tubes either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> or oblique to the horizon, gravitate on the lower part of the tubes, and not at all on the upper. Hence it follows, that, in a plant placed either obliquely or parallel to the horizon, the nutritious juice will act more on the lower part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> than on the upper; and by this means they will infuse more into the canals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> therewith, and be collected more copiously therein: thus the parts on the lower side will receive more accretion and be more nourished than those on the upper, the extremity of the plant will therefore be obliged to bend upwards.\n\nThis principle brings the seed into its due situation at first. In a bean planted upside down, the plume and radicle may be seen with the naked eye <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> at first directly for about an inch; after which they begin to bend, the one downward, and the other upward. The same is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in a heap of barley to be made into malt, or in a quantity of acorns laid to sprout in a moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, &c. Each grain of barley and each acorn has a different situation; and yet every sprout tends directly upward, and every root downward, and the curvity or bend they make is greater or less as their situation approaches more or less to the direction wherein no curvature at all would be necessary. But two such opposite motions cannot possibly arise without supposing some difference between the two parts: the only one we know of is, that the plume is fed by a juice imported to it by tubes parallel to its sides, whereas the radicle imbibes its nourishment at every pore in its surface. When the plume therefore is either parallel or inclined to the horizon, the nutritious juice, feeding the lower parts more than the upper, will determine its extremes to turn upward, for the reasons before given. On the contrary, when the radicle is in the like situation, the nutritious juice penetrating through the upper part more copiously than through the under, there will be a greater accretion of the former than of the latter; and the radicle will therefore be bent downwards, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> curvity of the plume and radicle must continue till such time as their sides are nourished alike, which cannot be till they are perpendicular.\n\nOf the Food of Plants.\u2014This hath been so fully discussed under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, that little remains to be said upon the subject in this place. The method of making deplogificated or vital air de novo, is now so much improved, that numberless experiments may be made with it both on animals and vegetables. It appears, indeed, that these two parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> are a kind of counterbalance to one another; and the noxious parts or excrements of the one prove salutary food to the other. Thus, from the animal body continually pass off certain effluvia, which vitiate or phlogisticate the air. Nothing can be more prejudicial to animal life than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of these effluvia: on the other hand, nothing is more favourable to vegetables than those excrementitious effluvia of animals; and accordingly they greedily absorb them from the earth, or from the air. With respect to the excrementitious parts of living vegetables, the case is reversed. The purest plant air is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EFFLUVIUM\">effluvium</a> which passes off from vegetables; and this, however favourable to animal life, is by no means so to vegetable; whence we have an additional proof of the doctrine concerning the food of plants delivered under the article Agriculture.\n\nWith regard to the effects of other kinds of air on vegetation, a difference of some consequence took place between Dr Priestley and Dr Percival. The former, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his Experiments and Observations on Air, had asserted that fixed air is fatal to vegetable as well as to animal life. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, however, was opposed by Dr Percival, and the contrary one adopted by Dr Hunter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> in the Georigal Essays, vol. v. The experiments related by these two gentlemen would indeed have been decisive, had they been made with sufficient accuracy. That this was the case, however, Dr Priestley denies; and in the 3d volume of his Treatise on Air has fully detected the mistakes in Dr Percival's Experiments; which proceeded in fact from his having used, not fixed air, but common air mixed with a small quantity of fixed air. His experiments, when repeated with the purest fixed air, and in the most careful manner, were always attended with the same effect, namely, the killing of the plant.\n\nIt had also been asserted by Drs Percival and Hunter, that water impregnated with fixed air was more favourable to vegetation than simple water. This opinion was likewise examined by Dr Priestley; however, his experiments were indecisive; but seem rather unfavourable to the use of fixed air than otherwise.\n\nAnother very remarkable fact with regard to the food of plants has been discovered by Dr Priestley; namely, that some of them, such as the willow, comfrey, and duckweed, are nourished by inflammable air. The first, he says, flourishes in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of air so remarkably, that, \"it may be said to feed upon it with great avidity.\" This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> terminates in the change of what remains of the inflammable air into phlogisticated air, and sometimes into a species of air as good as common air; or even better; so that it must be the inflammable principle in the air that the plant takes, converting it, no doubt, into its proper nourishment.\"\n\nWhat the followers of Stahl <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> phlogisticated air and inflammable air, are so closely allied to each other, that it is no wonder they should prove prolificuously for the food of plants. The reason why both are not agreeable to all kinds of plants, most probably is the different quantity of phlogistic matter contained in them, and the different action of the latent fire they contain; for all plants do not require an equal quantity of nourishment; and such as require but little, will be destroyed by having too much. The action of heat also is essentially necessary to vegetation; and it is probable that very much of this principle is absorbed from the air by vegetables. But if the air by which plants are partly nourished contains too much of that principle, it is very probable that they may be destroyed from this cause as well as the other; and thus inflammable air, which contains a vast quantity of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principle, may destroy such plants as grow in a dry soil, though it preserves those which grow in a wet one. See Vegetation.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">Diffusion</a> of Plants.\u2014So great are the prolific powers of the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, that a single plant almost of any kind, if left to itself, would, in a short time, overrun\noverrun the whole world. Indeed, supposing the plant to have been only a single annual, with two seeds, it would, in 20 years, produce more than a million of its own species; what numbers then must have been produced by a plant whose seeds are so numerous as many of those with which we are acquainted? In that part of our work we have given particular examples of the very prolific nature of plants, which we need not repeat here; and we have made some observations on the means by which they are carried to distant places. This is a very curious matter of fact, and as such we shall now give a fuller account of it.\n\nIf nature had appointed no means for the scattering of these numerous seeds, but allowed them to fall down in the place where they grew, the young vegetables must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> have choked one another as they grew up, and not a single plant could have arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. But so many ways are there appointed for the dissemination of plants, that we see they not only do not hinder each other's growth, but a single plant will in a short time spread through different countries. The most evident means for this purpose are,\n\n1. The force of the air.\u2014That the efficacy of this may be the greater, nature has raised the seeds of vegetables upon stalks, so that the wind has thus an opportunity of acting upon them with the greatest advantage. The seed-capsules also open at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>, left the ripe seeds should drop out without being widely dispersed by the wind. Others are furnished with wings, and a papery down, by which, after they come to maturity, they are carried up into the air, and have been known to fly the distance of 50 miles: 138 genera are found to have winged seeds.\n\n2. In some plants the seed-vessels open with violence when the seeds are ripe, and thus throw them to a considerable distance; and we have an enumeration of 50 genera whose seeds are thus dispersed.\n\n3. Other seeds are furnished with hooks, by which, when ripe, they adhere to the coats of animals, and are carried by them to their lodging places. Linnaeus reckons 50 genera armed in this manner.\n\n4. Many seeds are dispersed by means of birds and other animals; who pick up the berries, and afterwards eject the seeds uninjured. Thus the fox disseminates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PRIVET\">privet</a>, and many species of fruit. The plants found growing upon walls and houses, on the tops of high rocks, &c., are mostly brought there by birds; and it is universally known, that by manuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> with new dung, innumerable weeds will spring up which did not exist there before: 193 species are reckoned up which may be disseminated in this manner.\n\n5. The growth of other seeds is promoted by animals in a different way. While some are eaten, others are scattered and trodden into the ground by them. The squirrel gnaws the cones of the pine, and many of the seeds fall out. When the loxia eats off their bark, almost his only food, many of their seeds are committed to the earth, or mixed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORASS\">morass</a> with moss, where he had retired. The glandularia, when she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> up her nuts, often forgets them, and they strike root. The same is observable of the walnut; mice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> great quantities of them, and being afterwards killed by different animals, the nuts germinate.\n\n6. We are astonished to find moths, fungi, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BYSSUS\">byssus</a>, and mucor, growing everywhere; but it is for want of reflecting that their seeds are so minute that they are almost invisible to the naked eye. They float in the air like atoms, and are dropped everywhere, but grow only in those places where there was no vegetation before; and hence we find the same moths in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\n7. Seeds are also dispersed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. \"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a> (says Linnaeus), we see the most evident proofs how far rivers contribute to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> the seeds of plants. I have seen Alpine plants growing upon their shores frequently 36 miles distant from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>; for their seeds falling into the rivers, and being carried along and left by the stream, take root there.\u2014We may gather likewise from many circumstances how much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> furthers this business.\u2014In R\u00f6llagia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Graefea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OELAND\">Oeland</a>, Gothland, and the shores of Scania, there are many foreign and German plants not yet naturalized in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>. The centaury is a German plant, whose seeds being carried by the wind into the sea, the waves landed this foreigner upon the coasts of Sweden. I was astonished to see the veronica maritima, a German plant, growing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORNEA\">Tornea</a>, which hitherto had been found only in Graefea: the sea was the vehicle by which this plant was transported thither from Germany; or possibly it was brought from Germany to Graefea, and from thence to Tornea. Many have imagined, and erroneously, that seed corrupts in water, and loses its principle of vegetation. Water at the bottom of the sea is seldom warm enough to destroy seeds; we have seen water cover the surface of a field for a whole winter, while the seed which it contained remained unhurt, until at the beginning of spring the waters were let down so low by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>, that the warmth of the sun-beams reached to the bottom. Then the seeds germinate, but presently become putrefied; so that for the rest of the year the earth remains naked and barren. Rain and showers carry seeds into the cracks of the earth, streams, and rivers; which last, conveying them to a distance from their native places, plant them in a foreign soil.\"\n\n8. Lastly, some seeds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a> their projection to a distance in a very surprising manner. The crupina, a species of centaury, has its seeds covered over with erect bristles, by whose affixture it creeps and moves about in such a manner, that it is by no means to be kept in the hand. If you confine one of them between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> and the foot, it creeps out either at the sleeve or neck-band, travelling over the whole body. If the bearded oat, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, be left with other grain in the barn, it extricates itself from the glume; nor does it stop in its progress till it gets to the walls of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. Hence, says Linnaeus, the Dalecarlian, after he has cut and carried it into the barn, in a few days finds all the glumes empty, and the oats separate from them; for every oat has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> arista or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> annexed to it, which is contracted in wet, and extended in dry weather. When the spiral is contracted, it drags the oat along with it: the arista being bearded with minute hairs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> downward, the grain necessarily follows it; but when it expands again, the oat does not go back to its former place, the roughness of the beard the contrary way preventing its return. If you take the seeds of equisetum, or fern, these being laid upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and viewed in a microscope, will be seen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> over any obstacle as if they had feet; by which they are separated and dispersed one from another; so that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> ignorant of this\nthis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> would pronounce these seeds to be so many mites or small insects.\n\nWe cannot finish this article without remarking, that many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> men believe that plants have a power of perception. Of this opinion we shall now give an account from the second volume of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> Transactions, where we find some speculations on the perceptive power of vegetables by Dr Percival, who attempts to show, by the several analogies of organization, life, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, spontaneity, and self-motion, that plants, like animals, are endowed with the powers both of perception and enjoyment. The attempt is ingenious, and is ingeniously supported, but in our opinion fails to convince. That there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> between animals and vegetables is certain; but we cannot from thence conclude that they either perceive or enjoy. Botanists have, it is true, derived from anatomy and physiology, almost all the terms employed in the description of plants. But we cannot from thence conclude, that their organization, though it bears an analogy to that of animals, is the sign of a living principle, if to this principle we annex the idea of perception; yet so fully is our author convinced of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of it, that he does not think it extravagant to suppose, that, in some future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, perceptivity may be discovered to extend even beyond the limits now assigned to vegetable life. Corallines, madreporites, millipores, and sponges, were formerly considered as fossil bodies; but the experiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Marsigli evinced, that they are endowed with life, and led him to clasps them with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> plants. And the observations of Ellis, Jussieu, and Peyronel, have since raised them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of animals. The detection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, in long established opinions concerning one branch of natural knowledge, justifies the suspicion of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> in others, which are nearly allied to it. And it will appear from the prosecution of our inquiry into the instincts, spontaneity, and self-moving power of vegetables, that the suspicion is not without foundation.\n\nHe then goes on to draw a comparison between the instincts of animals and those of vegetables; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>, as soon as it comes into the world, applies to the teats of the cow; and the duckling, though hatched under a hen, runs to the water.\n\n\"B) Dr Watson, the bishop of Landaff, who has espoused the same side of the question with Dr Percival (see the 5th vol. of his Chemical Essays), reasons thus on the motions of vegetables. \"Whatever can produce any effect (says he) upon an animal organ, as the impact of external bodies, heat and cold, the vapour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> sulphur, of volatile alkali, want of air, &c., are found to act also upon the plants called sensitive.\" But not to insist upon any more instances, the muscular motions of the dionaea muscipula, lately brought into Europe from America, seem far superior in quickness to those of a variety of animals. Now to refer the muscular motions of shell-fish and zoophytes to an internal principle of volition, to make them indicative of the perceptivity of the being, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the more notable ones of vegetables to certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> dilatations and contractions of parts occasioned by external impulse, is to err against that rule of philosophizing which assigns the same causes for effects of the same kind. The motions in both cases are equally accommodated to the preservation of the being to which they belong, are equally distinct and uniform, and should be equally derived from mechanism, or equally admitted as criterions of perception.\n\n\"I am sensible that these and other similar motions of vegetables may by some be considered as analogous to the automatic or involuntary motions of animals; but as it is not yet determined amongst the physiologists, whether the motion of the heart, the peristaltic motion of the bowels, the contractions observable upon external impulse in the muscles of animals deprived of their heads and hearts, be attributable to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> unaccompanied with perceptivity, or to an uneasy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, there seems to be no reason for entering into to obscure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>; especially since irritability, if admitted as the cause of the motions of vegetables, must a fortiori be admitted as the cause of the less exquisite and discernible motions of being universally referred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMAL_KINGDOM\">animal kingdom</a>.\"\ndownwards, in the middle glass vessel of Dr Nouth's machine, continued to thrive vigorously, without any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PABULUM\">pabulum</a> than what was supplied by the stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEPHITIC\">mephitic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> to which it was exposed. In 24 hours the stem formed into a curve, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> became erect, and gradually ascended towards the mouth of the vessel; thus producing, by successive efforts, a new and unusual configuration of its parts. Such exertions in the sprig of mint, to rectify its inverted position, and to remove from a foreign to its natural element, seems to evince evolution to avoid what was evil, and to recover what had been experienced to be good. If a plant, in a garden-pot, be placed in a room which has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> except from a hole in the wall, it will shoot towards the hole, pass through it into the open air, and then vegetate upwards in its proper direction. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames relates, that, amongst the ruins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEW_ABBEY\">New <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>, formerly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a>, there grows on the top of a wall a plane tree, 20 feet high. Straightened for nourishment in that barren situation, it several years ago directed roots down the side of the wall till they reached the ground ten feet below: and now the nourishment it afforded to these roots, during the time of descending, is amply repaid; having every year since that time made vigorous shoots. From the top of the wall to the surface of the earth, these roots have not thrown out a single fibre, but are now united into a pretty thick hard root.\n\n\"The regular movements by which the sunflower presents its splendid disk to the sun have been known to naturalists, and celebrated by poets, both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. Ovid founds upon it a beautiful story; and Thomson describes it as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to the celestial luminary.\n\n\"But one, the lofty follower of the sun,\nSad when he sets, flouts up her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> leaves,\nDrooping all night; and when he warm returns,\nPoints her enamour'd bosom to his ray.\"\n\nDr Percival next touches on motion; he mentions co-\n* See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">Pen</a>-\nnatulae, sea-pens*, oysters, &c., as endowed with the power\nmatuia, of motion in a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, and then he speaks in\nthe following manner. \"Mr Miller (says he), in his late account of the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a>, mentions a species of coral, which the inhabitants have mistaken for a plant, and have denominated it talan-cout, or sea-grass. It is found in shallow bays, where it appears like a straight stick, but when touched withdraws itself into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. Now if self-moving faculties like these indicate ani-\nmality, can such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> be denied to vegetables, possested of them in an equal or superior degree? The water-lily, be the pond deep or shallow in which it grows, pushes up its flower-stems till they reach the open air, that the farina fecundans may perform without injury its proper office. About seven in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the stalk erects itself, and the flowers rise above the surface of the water: in this state they continue till four in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, when the stalk becomes relaxed, and the flowers sink and close. The motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SENSITIVE_PLANT\">sensitive plant</a> have been long noticed with admiration, as exhibiting the most obvious signs of perceptivity. And if we admit such motions as criteria of a like power in other beings, to attribute them in this instance to mere mecha-\n\nnism, actuated solely by external impulse, is to deviate from the founded rule of philosophizing, which directs us not to multiply causes when the effects appear to be the same. Neither will the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> better solve the phenomena of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> vegetable: for its leaves are equally affected by the contact of electric and non-electric bodies; show no change in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> whether the atmosphere be dry or moist; and instantly close when the vapour of volatile alkali or the fumes of burning sulphur are applied to them. The powers of chemical stimuli to produce contractions in the fibres of this plant may perhaps lead some philosophers to refer them to the vis infusa, or irritability, which they assign to certain parts of organized matter, totally distinct from, and independent of, any sentient energy. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> is evidently a fallacy, and refutes itself. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of irritability can only be proved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of irritations, and the idea of irritation involves in it that of feeling.\n\n\"But there is a species of the order of decandra, which constantly and uniformly exerts a self-moving power, uninfluenced either by chemical stimuli, or by any external impulse whatsoever. This curious shrub, which was unknown to Linnaeus, is a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies, but has been cultivated in several botanical gardens here. I had an opportunity of examining it in the collection of the late Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>. See HEDYSARUM.\u2014I cannot better comment on this wonderful degree of vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> than in the words of Cicero. Inanimatum est omne quod pulsus agitur externo; quod autem est animal, id motu cietur interiore et suo.\n\n\"I have thus attempted, with the brevity prescribed by the laws of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, to extend our views of animated nature; to gratify the mind with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of multiplied accessions to the general aggregate of felicity; and to exalt our conceptions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, power, and beneficence of God. In an undertaking never yet accomplished, disappointment can be no disgrace: in one directed to such noble objects, the motives are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, independently of success. Truth, indeed, obliges me to acknowledge, that I review my speculations with much diffidence; and that I dare not presume to expect they will produce any permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> in others, because I experience an instability of opinion in myself. For, to use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Tully, Nec si quomodo, dum lego, affinis; cum pulsi librum, affinis omnium illa elabitur.\u2014But this skepticism is perhaps to be ascribed to the influence of habitual preconceptions, rather than to a deficiency of reasonable proof. For besides the various arguments which have been advanced in favour of vegetable perceptivity, it may be further urged, that the hypothesis recommends itself by its consonance to those higher analogies of nature, which lead us to conclude, that the greatest possible sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> exists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>. The bottom of the ocean is overpread with plants of the most luxuriant magnitude. Immense regions of the earth are covered with perennial forests. Nor are the Alps, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>, destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a>, though buried in deeps of snow. And can it be imagined that such profusion of life subsists without the least sensation or enjoyment? Let us rather, with humble reverence, suppose, that vegetables participate, in some low degree, of the common allotment of vitality; and that our great Creator hath apportioned\napportioned good to all living things, 'in number, weight, and measure.' See Sensitive Plant, Mimosa, Dionaea Mycetula, Vegetable Motion, &c.\n\nTo these ingenious and spirited observations, we shall subjoin nothing of our own, but leave our readers to determine for themselves (c). Speculations of this kind, when carried on by sober men, will never be productive of bad consequences; but by the subtle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCEPTIC\">sceptic</a>, or the more unwary inquirer, they may be made the engine of very dangerous errors. By this we do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to inferrinate that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of inquiry should be suppressed, because that spirit, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of weak or of wicked men, may be abused. By those, however, who know the bad consequences that may be drawn, and indeed that have been drawn, from the opinions we have now given an account of, our caution will not be deemed impertinent.\n\nPLANTS growing on Animals. See Insects giving root to Plants.\n\nSexes of PLANTS. See Sexes and Botany.\n\nColours of PLANTS. See Colour of Plants.\n\nColours extracted from PLANTS. See Colour-making.\n\nMethod of Drying and Preserving PLANTS for Botanists.\u2014Many methods have been devised for the preservation of plants: we shall relate only those that have been found most successful.\n\nFirst prepare a press, which a workman will make by the following directions. Take two planks of wood not liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARP\">warp</a>. The planks must be two inches thick, 18 inches long, and 12 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. Get four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> screws, such as are commonly used for securing sash windows. Let the four female screws be let into the four corners of one of the planks, and corresponding holes made through the four corners of the other plank for the male screws to pass through, so as to allow the two planks to be screwed tightly together. It will not be amiss to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> of the male screws upon the wood with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> plates; and if the iron plates went across from corner to corner of the wood, it would be a good security against the warping.\n\nSecondly, get half a dozen quires of large soft spongy paper (such as the stationers call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOSSOM\">blossom</a> blotting paper is the best), and a few sheets of strong pasteboard.\n\nThe plants you wish to preserve should be gathered in a dry day, after the sun hath exhaled the dew; taking particular care to collect them in that state wherein their generic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> characters are most conspicuous. Carry them home in a tin box nine inches long, four inches and a half wide, and one inch and a half deep. Get the box made of the thinnest tinned iron that can be procured; and let the lid open upon hinges. If anything happen to prevent the immediate use of the specimens you have collected, they will be kept fresh two or three days in this box much better than by putting them in water. When you are going to preserve them, suffer them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> until they become limber; and then they should be laid upon a pasteboard, as much as possible in their natural form, but at the same time with a particular view to their generic and specific characters. For this purpose it will be advisable to separate one of the flowers, and to display the generic character. If the specific character depend upon the flower or upon the root, a particular display of that will be likewise necessary. When the plant is thus disposed upon the pasteboard, cover it with eight or ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of spongy paper, and put it into the press. Exert only a small degree of pressure for the first two or three days; then examine it, unfold any unnatural plats, rectify any mistakes, and, after putting fresh paper over it, screw the press harder. In about three days more separate the plant from the pasteboard, if it is sufficiently firm to allow of a change of place; put it upon a fresh pasteboard, and, covering it with fresh blossom paper, let it remain in the press a few days longer. The press should stand in the sunshine, or within the influence of a fire.\n\nWhen it is perfectly dry, the usual method is to fasten it down, with paste or gum water, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-hand inner page of a sheet of large strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>-paper. It requires some dexterity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a> the plant neatly down, so that none of the gum or paste may appear to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFILE\">defile</a> the paper. Press it gently again for a day or two, with a half sheet of blossom-paper betwixt the folds of the writing paper. When it is quite dry, write upon the left-hand inner page of the paper the name of the plant; the specific character; the place where, and the time when, it was found; and any other remarks you may think proper. Upon the back of the same page, near the fold of the paper, write the name of the plant, and then place it in your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABINET\">cabinet</a>. A small quantity of finely powdered arsenic, or corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>, is usually mixed with the paste or gum-water, to prevent the devastations of insects; but the seeds of slaves-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> finely powdered will answer the same purpose, without being liable to corrode or to change the colour of the more delicate plants. Some people put the dried plants into the sheets of writing paper, without fastening them down at all; and others only fasten them by means of small slips of paper, pasted across the stem or branches. Where the species of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> are numerous, and the specimens are small, several of them may be put into one sheet of paper.\n\nAnother more expeditious method is to take the plants out of the press after the first or second day; let them remain upon the pasteboard; cover them with five or six leaves of blossom paper, and iron them with a hot smoothing\n\n(c) In the 2d volume of Transactions of the Linnaean Society, we find Dr Percival's reasoning very ably combated, as far as he draws his consequences from the external motions of plants; where it is argued, that these motions, though in some respects similar to those of animals, can and ought to be explained, without concluding that they are endowed either with perception or volition. Mr Townson concludes his paper in these words: \"When all is considered (says he), I think we shall place this opinion among the many ingenious flights of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and soberly follow that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> impulse which leads us naturally to give fenation and perceptivity to animal life, and to deny it to vegetables; and so still say with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, and our great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> Linnaeus, Vegetabilia crescunt & vivunt; animalia crescunt, vivunt, & sentiunt.\"\nsmoothing iron until they are perfectly dry. If the iron be too hot, it will change the colours; but some people, taught by long practice, will succeed very happily. This is quite the best method to treat the orchis and other fleshy mucilaginous plants.\n\nAnother method is to take the plants when fresh gathered, and, instead of putting them into the press, immediately to fasten them down to the paper with strong gum water: then dip a camel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> into spirit-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, and varnish the whole surface of the plant two or three times over. This method succeeds very well with plants that are readily laid flat, and it preserves their colours better than any other. The spirit varnish is made thus. To a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of highly rectified spirit of wine put five ounces of gum sandarach; two ounces of mastic in drops; one ounce of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> gum elemi, and one ounce of oil of spike-lavender. Let it stand in a warm place, and shake it frequently to expedite the solution of the gums.\n\nWhere no better convenience can be had, the specimens may be disposed systematically in a large folio book; but a vegetable cabinet is upon all accounts more eligible. With the affluence of the following description a workman may readily make one. The drawers must have backs and sides, but no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> than a small ledge. Each drawer will be 14 inches wide, and 10 inches from the back to the front, after allowing half an inch for the thickness of the two sides, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch for the thickness of the back. The sides of the drawers, in the part next the front, must be sloped off in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a> line, something like what the workmen call an ogive. The bottoms of the drawers must be made to slide in grooves cut in the uprights, so that no space may be lost betwixt drawer and drawer. After allowing a quarter of an inch for the thickness of the bottom of each drawer, the clear perpendicular space in each must be as in the following table:\n\nI. Two tenths of an inch.\nII. One inch and two-tenths.\nIII. Four inches and six-tenths.\nIV. Two inches and three-tenths.\nV. Seven inches and eight-tenths.\nVI. Two inches and two-tenths.\nVII. Two tenths of an inch.\nVIII. One inch and four-tenths.\nIX. Two-tenths of an inch.\nX. Two inches and eight-tenths.\nXI. One inch and two-tenths.\nXII. Three inches and five-tenths.\nXIII. Two inches and four-tenths.\nXIV. Three inches and eight-tenths.\nXV. Three inches and four-tenths.\nXVI. One inch and three-tenths.\nXVII. Two inches and eight-tenths.\nXVIII. Six tenths of an inch.\nXIX. Ten inches.\nXX. One inch and nine-tenths.\nXXI. Four inches and four-tenths.\nXXII. Two inches and six-tenths.\nXXIII. One inch and two-tenths.\nXXIV. Seventeen inches.\n\nThis cabinet shuts up with two doors in front; and the whole may stand upon a base, containing a few drawers for the reception of duplicates and papers.\n\nFossil Plants. Many species of tender and herbaceous plants are found at this day, in great abundance, buried at considerable depths in the earth, and converted, as it were, into the nature of the matter they lie among; fossil wood is often found very little altered, and often impregnated with substances of almost all the different fossil kinds, and lodged in all the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, sometimes firmly imbedded in hard matter; sometimes loose: but this is by no means the case with the tenderer and more delicate subjects of the vegetable world. These plants are usually immersed either in a blackish flaky substance, found lying over the strata of coal, else in loose nodules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a> matter of a pebble-like form, and they are always altered into the nature of the substance they lie among: what we meet with of these are principally of the fern kind; and what is very singular, though a very certain truth, is, that these are principally the ferns of American growth, not those of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. The most frequent fossil plants are the polypody, spleenwort, osmund, trichomanes, and the several larger and smaller ferns; but besides these there are also found pieces of the equisetum or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-tail, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> of the filleted plants, as the clivers, madder, and the like; and these have been too often mistaken for flowers; sometimes there are also found complete grasses, or parts of them, as also reeds, and other watery plants; sometimes the ears of corn, and not unfrequently the twigs or bark, and impressions of the bark and fruit of the pine or fir kind, which have been, from their fealy appearance, mistaken for the skins of fishes; and sometimes, but that very rarely, we meet with moles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SEA_PLANTS\">sea-plants</a>.\n\nMany of the ferns not unfrequently found, are of very singular kinds, and some species yet unknown to us; and the leaves of some appear set at regular distances, with round protuberances and cavities. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> which contain these plants split readily, and are often found to contain, on one side, the impression of the plant, and on the other the prominent plant itself; and, beside all that have been mentioned, there have been frequently supposed to have been found with us ears of common wheat, and of the maize or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> corn; the first being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> no other than the common endmost branches of the firs, and the other the thicker boughs of various species of that and of the pine kind, with their leaves fallen off; such branches in such a state cannot but afford many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> and papillae, and, in some species, such as are more regularly disposed.\n\nThese are the kinds most obvious in England; and these are either immersed in the flaky <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which constitutes whole strata, or in flatted nodules usually of about three inches broad, which readily split into two pieces on being struck.\n\nThey are most common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, in coal-pits near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>, and the forest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a>; but are more or less found about almost all our coal-pits, and many of our iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>. Though these seem the only species of plants found with us, yet in Germany there are many others, and those found in different substances. A whitish stone, a little harder than chalk, frequently contains them: they are found also often in a gray flaky stone of a firmer texture, not unfrequently in a blackish one, and at times in many others. Nor are the bodies themselves less various here than the matter in which they are contained: the leaves of trees are found in great abundance, among which those of the willow, poplar, white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>, and pear trees, are the most common; small branches of box, leaves of the olive tree, and stalks of garden thyme, are also found there; and sometimes ears of the various species of corn, and the larger as well as the smaller moles in great abundance.\n\nThese seem the tender vegetables, or herbaceous plants, certainly found thus immersed in hard stone, and buried","sp":214,"ep":233},{"h":"PLANT","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of preserving them in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> shape and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.

In taking up the trees, carefully dig away the earth round the roots, so as to come at their several parts to cut them off; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are torn out of the ground without care, the roots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be broken and bruised, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> injury of the trees. When you have taken them up, the next thing is to prepare them for planting by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUNING\">pruning</a> the roots and heads. And first, as to the roots; all the small fibres are to be cut off, as near to the place from whence they are produced, as may be, except they are to be replanted immediately after they are taken up. Then prune off all the bruised or broken roots, all such as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> each other, and all downright roots, especially in fruit-trees: shorten the larger roots in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the strength, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the tree; observing that the walnut, mulberry, and some other tender-rooted kinds should not be pruned so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> as the more hardy sorts of fruit and forest trees: in young fruit-trees, such as pears, apples, plums, peaches, &c. that are one year old from the time of their budding or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAFTING\">grafting</a>, the roots may be left only about eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>; but in older trees, they must be left of a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>; but this is only to be underwood of the larger roots; for the small ones must be chiefly cut quite out, or pruned very short. The next thing is the pruning of their heads, which must be differently performed in different trees; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the trees must also be considered. Thus, if they are designed for walls or espaliers, it is best to plant them with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their heads, which should remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> till they begin to shoot in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, when they must be cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to five or six eyes, at the same time taking care not to disturb the roots. But if the trees are designed for standards, you should prune off all the small branches close to the place where they are produced, as also the irregular ones which cross each other; and after having displaced these branches, you should also cut off all such parts of branches as have by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> been broken or wounded; but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means cut off the main leading shoots which are necessary to attract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> from the root, and thereby promote the growth of the tree. Having thus prepared the trees for planting, you must now proceed to place them in the earth; but first, if the trees have been long out of the ground, so that the fibres of the roots are dried, place them eight or ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, before they are planted, with their heads erect, and the roots only immersed therein;\n\nfor that, by long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the finest mould into stiff clay. The proprietor of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> must therefore grudge no labour to drain it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>; and yet by such easy gradation as to prevent the mould from being washed away by great floods, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the under stratum be a loam,\nwhich will swell the dried veffels of the roots, and prepare them to imbibe nourishment from the earth. In planting them, great regard should be had to the nature of the soil; for if that be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and moist, the trees should be planted very shallow; and if it be a hard rock or gravel, it will be better to raise a hill of earth where each tree is to be planted, than to dig into the rock or gravel, and fill it up with earth, as is too often practised, by which means the trees are planted as it were in a tub, and have but little room to extend their roots. The next thing to be observed is, to place the trees in the hole in such a manner that the roots may be about the same depth in the ground as before they were taken up; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the earth fine with a spade, and scatter it into the hole, so that it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in between every root, that there may be no hollows in the earth: then having filled up the hole, gently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> down the earth with your feet, but do not make it too hard; which is a great fault, especially if the ground be strong or wet. Having thus planted the trees, they should be fastened to stakes driven into the ground to prevent their being displaced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, and some mulch laid upon the surface of the ground about their roots; as to such as are planted against walls, their roots should be placed about five or six inches from the wall, to which their heads should be nailed to prevent their being blown up by the wind. The reasons for planting are various, according to the different sorts of trees, or the soil in which they are planted. For the trees whose leaves fall off in winter, the best time is the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, provided the soil be dry; but if it be a very wet soil, it is better to defer it till the latter end of February, or the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>; and for many kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVERGREENS\">evergreens</a>, the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> is by far the best season; though they may be safely removed at midsummer, provided they are not to be carried very far; but should always make choice of a cloudy wet season.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the papers, &c. of the Bath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> on planting waste grounds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who writes it informs us, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, where he resides, there were about 60 or 70 years ago vast tracts of uncultivated ground, which were then thought totally barren. \"The western parts of it (says he) abounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, that they were carried about by every wind; and in many places the sands were so loose that no grass could grow upon them. Art and industry, however, have now altered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of this once Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, that it wears a very different appearance. Most of these tracts are either planted or rendered very good corn-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and sheepwalks.\n\n\"About 30 years since, the sides of many of our little sand-hills were fown with the seeds of French furze, and when a wet season followed, they succeeded very well, and grew so fast, that once in three or four years they are cut for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, and sell at a good price at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THETFORD\">Thetford</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDON\">Brandon</a>, Harling, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWAFFHAM\">Swaffham</a>, and places adjacent. This excited some public-spirited gentlemen, among whom was the late Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUXTON\">Buxton</a> of Shadwell-Lodge, near Thetford, to attempt the planting of Scotch and spruce firs, and other hardy forest-trees. At first they found some difficulty from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> looseness of the sand. But as there is in all this part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> marle, at about three feet depth below the land, they very judiciously thought that incorporating it with the sand in the holes where their young trees were planted, would insure success; nor were they disappointed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> succeeded beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>; the plantations thrived exceedingly, and the roots soon reached below the sand, after which they were out of danger. This excited them to further attempts.\n\n\"On the spots where they intended to raise new plantations from seeds and acorns, they laid on a thick coat of marle and clay, which after being rough spread, and lying a winter in that state, was made fine, and ploughed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before planting. By these means the soil became fixed, and in a little time covered with grass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a>; so that there are now vast plantations of firs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>, and forest-trees, in the most healthy and vigorous state, where within my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> ten acres of land would not maintain a single sheep three months.\n\n\"But the benefit of plantations, whether of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, copses, or trees, is not confined to the immediate advantage, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> value of the wood. By annually feeding a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of leaves, which the winds disperse, and the rains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> into the soil, it is considerably improved; and whenever such copses have been stubbed up, the ground (however unfruitful before planting) has thereby been so enriched as to bear excellent crops for many years, without the additional help of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>. How much land-owners are interested in planting waste or barren spots I need not mention; and nothing but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of indolence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> unpardonable in this enlightened age could induce them to neglect it.\n\n\"Nature has furnished us with plants, trees, and shrubs, adapted to almost every soil and situation; and as the laws of vegetation are now much better understood than formerly, it is a reproach to those whose practice does not keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with their knowledge in making the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of her bounty. Let no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> repine and say the land is barren; for those spots which appear to be so, owe that appearance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> negligence. Industry and art might soon render an eighth part of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> nearly as valuable as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, which now remains in a state unprofitable to the owners, and disgraceful to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\"\n\nRosse's PLANTING, a method of planting in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> position of the plant or shoot is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>; the branches being set into the earth, and the root raised into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Dr Agricola mentions this monstrous method of planting, which he found to succeed very well in most all sorts of fruit-trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>-trees, &c. Bradley affirms, that he has seen a lime-tree in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> growing with its first roots in the air, which had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> out branches in great plenty, at the same time that its first branches produced roots and fed the tree. Mr Fairchild of Hoxton has practised the same with us, and gives the following directions for performing it: Make choice of a young tree of one foot, of alder, elm, willow, or any other tree that easily takes root by laying; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the shoot gently down into the earth, and so let it remain until it has taken root. Then dig about the first root, and raise it gently out of the ground, till the stem be nearly upright, and stake it up. Then prune the roots, now erected in the air, from the bruises and wounds they received in being dug up; and anoint the pruned parts with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two ounces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, four ounces of tallow, and four ounces of beeswax, melted together, and applied pretty warm. Afterwards\nPlanudes, towards prune off all the buds or shoots that are upon the item, and dress the wounds with the same composition, to prevent any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> shootings, that might spoil the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the item.","sp":241,"ep":243},{"h":"PLANUDES","t":"MAXIMUS, a Greek monk of Constantinople, towards the end of the 14th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, who published a collection of epigrams intitled Anthologia; a Greek translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of \u00c6lop, which is rather a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; and some other works.

See HEDGES.\n\nIt is performed in this manner: The old stubs must be cut off, &c. within two or three inches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>; and the best and longest of the middle-sized shoots must be left to lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. Some of the strongest of these must also be left to answer the purpose of stakes. These are to be cut off to the height at which the hedge is intended to be left; and they are to stand at ten feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> one from another: when there are not proper shoots for these at the due distances, their places must be supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> stakes of dead wood. The hedge is to be first thinned, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> away all but those shoots which are intended to be used either as stakes, or the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the plashing: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a> is to be cleaned out with the spade; and it must be now dug as at first, with sloping sides each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; and when there is any cavity on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> on which the hedge grows, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> has been washed away from the roots of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, it is to be made good by facing it, as they express it, with the mould dug from the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the ditch: all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the earth dug out of the ditch is to be laid upon the top of the bank: and the owner should look carefully into it that this be done; for the workmen, to spare themselves trouble, are apt to throw as much as they can upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the bank; which being by this means overloaded, is soon washed off into the ditch again, and a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> part of the work undone; whereas what is laid on the top of the bank always remains there, and makes a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> of an indifferent hedge.\n\nIn the plashing the quick, two extremes are to be avoided; these are, the laying it too low, and the laying it too thick. The latter makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> run all into the shoots, and leaves the plashes without sufficient nourishment; which, with the thickness of the hedge, finally kills them. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> of laying them too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, is equally to be avoided; for this carries up all the nourishment into the plashes, and so makes the shoots small and weak at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, and consequently the hedge thin. This is a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of England. The best hedges made anywhere in England are those in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a>; for they are plashed in a middle way between the two extremes, and the cattle are by that prevented both from cropping the young shoots, and from going through; and a new and vigorous hedge soon forms itself.\n\nWhen the shoot is bent down that is intended to be plashed, it must be cut half way through with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>: the cut must be given sloping, somewhat downwards, and then it is to be wound about the stakes, and after this its superfluous branches are to be cut off as they stand out at the sides of the hedge. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> for the first year or two, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> where a new hedge is made can be ploughed, it will thrive the better for it; but if the stubs are very old, it is best to cut them quite down, and to fence them with good dead hedges on both sides, till the shoots are grown up from them strong enough to plash; and wherever void spaces are seen, new sets are to be planted to fill them up. A new hedge raised from sets in the common way, generally requires plashing in about eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years after.","sp":243,"ep":243},{"h":"PLASSEY","t":"is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Muxadab in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, famous for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> fought between the English under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Clive, and the native Hindoos under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NABOB\">nabob</a> Surajah Dowlah.

Mr. Boyle gives an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, among his experiments with the air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, of his preparing a tube of this plaster, closed at one end and open at the other; and on applying the open end to the cement, as is usually done with the receivers, it was found utterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to exhaust all the air out of it; for fresh air from without pressed in as fast as the other, or internal air, was exhausted, though the sides of the tube were of considerable thickness. A tube of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> was then put on the engine; so that being filled with water, the tube of plaster of Paris was covered with it; and on using the pump, it was immediately seen, that the water palled through into it as easily as the air had done, when that was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIENT\">ambient</a> fluid. After this, trying it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a> instead of water, the thing succeeded very well; and the tube might be perfectly exhausted, and would remain in that state several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. After this, on pouring some hot oil upon the turpentine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> was much altered; for the turpentine melting with this, that became a thinner fluid, and in this state capable of palling like water into the pores of the plaster. On taking away the tube after this, it was remarkable that the turpentine, which had pervaded and filled its pores, rendered it transparent, in the manner that water gives transparency to that singular stone called oculus mundi. In this manner, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of air, under proper management, will be capable of making several forts of glues penetrate plaster of Paris; and not only this, but baked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, wood, and all other bodies, porous enough to admit water on this occasion.\n\nPlaster of Paris is used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, as we find mentioned in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> inserted in the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Bath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> Papers, and which we shall insert here for the satisfaction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of our agricultural readers. \"The best kind is imported from hills in the vicinity of Paris; it is brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a>, and exported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAVRE\">Havre</a> de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>.

The lumps composed of flat shining specks are preferred to those which are formed of round particles like sand; the simple method of finding out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> is to pulverize some, and put it dry into an iron pot over the fire, when that which is good will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOM\">loom</a> boil, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> quantities of the fixed air escape by ebullition.

Its effects will generally appear in ten or fifteen days; after which the growth of the grass will be so great as to produce a large burden at the end of six weeks after sowing.\n\n\"It must be sown on dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, not subject to be overflowed. I have sown it on sand, loam, and clay, and it is difficult to say on which it has been answered, although the effect is sooner visible on sand. It has been used as a manure in this state for upwards of twelve years. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> may, from the best information I can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a>, be estimated from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> to twelve years; for, like other manure, its continuance very much depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> on which it is placed.\n\n\"One of my neighbours sowed some of his grasses on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> five years ago, another four years ago; a great part of my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> was sown in May 1788. We regularly mow two crops, and pasture in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>; no appearance of failure, the present crop being full as good as any preceding. I have this season mowed fifty acres of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> clover, timothy grass, white clover, &c., which was plastered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> May, July, and September; many who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the grass eliminated the produce at two tons per acre, but I calculate the two crops at three tons. Several strips were left in the different fields without plaster; these were in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> unproductive, being scarcely worth mowing. In April 1788, I covered a piece of grass land upwards of two inches thick with barn manure; in the same worn-out field I sowed plaster, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> it with the dung. I mowed the dugged and plastered land twice last year and once this; in every crop the plaster has produced the most. You will remember, in all experiments with clover, to mix about one-third timothy grass seed; it is of great advantage in serving as a support for the clover; it very much facilitates the curing of clover, and when cured is a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FODDER\">fodder</a>. The plaster operates equally as well on the other grasses as on clover. Its effect is said to be good on wheat, if sown in the spring; but I cannot say this from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> corn I know its operation...\"\nto be great; we use it at the rate of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> spoonful for a hill, put in immediately after dressing.\n\n\"From some accurate experiments last year made and reported to our Agricultural Society, it appears that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> bushels of additional corn per acre were produced by this method of using plaster.\"\n\nPLASTERING.

It seems, indeed, to have been rejected only by the followers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a> and Epicurus, who talk as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had thought gravity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to matter, and the fortuitous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of atoms, which they held to have been from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a>, the source not only of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> motions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, but also of the organization of all corporeal systems, and even of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and intellective, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> and in men. It is needless to say, that those men, whatever they might profess, were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">atheists</a>; and Democritus, it is universally known, avowed his atheism.\n\nThe greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the philosophers who held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLASTIC_NATURE\">plastic nature</a>, considered it not as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in the strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the word, but merely as an instrument in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>; though even among them there were some who held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> superior power, and were of course as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> atheists as Democritus himself. Such was Strato of Lampacus. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was originally of the peripatetic school, over which he presided many years, with no small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of reputation for learning and eloquence. He was the first and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> assertor of what has been termed Hylozoic atheism; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> which admits of no power superior to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> or plastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, essential, ingenerable, and incorruptible, inherent in matter, but without sense and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>. That such was his doctrine we learn from Cicero, who makes Velleius the Epicurean say, \"Nec audendus Strato qui Physicus appellatur, qui omnem vim divinam in Naturae fitam effe censet, quae causas gigantici, augendi, minuendi habeat, sed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARET\">caret</a> omni sensu.\" That Strato in admitting this plastic principle, differed widely from Democritus, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of him by the same author: Strato Lampacenus negat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> deorum le uti <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> fabricandum mundum, quaeunque sint docet omnia esse effecta naturae, nec ut illae, qui asperis, et levibus, et hamatis uncinateque corporibus concretae haec esse dicat, interjecta inani; somnia cenent haec esse Democriti, non docentis sed optantis.\n\nThat the rough and smooth, and hooked and crooked, atoms of Democritus, were indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> and delusions, is a position which no man <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> controvert; but surely Strato was himself as great a dreamer when he made sensation and intelligence result from a certain plastic or spermatic life in matter, which is itself devoid of sense and consciousness. It is, indeed, inconceivable, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the emphatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Cudworth, \"how any one in his senses should admit such a monstrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> as this, that every atom of dust has in itself as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> as the greatest politician and most profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, and yet is neither conscious nor intelligent!\"\n\nIt is to be observed of Strato likewise, that though he attributed a certain kind of life to matter, he by no means allowed of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> life as ruling over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> universe. He supposed the several parts of matter to have so many several plastic lives of their own, and seems to have attributed something to chance in the production and preservation of the mundane system.\n\nIn denying the existence of a God, perpetually directing his plastic principle, and in supposing as many of these principles as there are atoms of matter, Strato deviated far from the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>. The great founder of the peripatetic school, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as his apostate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>, taught that mundane things are not effected by fortuitous mechanism, but by such a nature as acts regularly and artificially for ends; yet he never considers this nature as the highest principle, or supreme Numen, but as subordinate to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> mind or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>; and he expressly affirms, that \"mind, together with nature, formed or fashioned this universe.\" He evidently considers mind as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and intelligent agent, and nature as the subservient and executive instrument. Indeed, we are strongly inclined to adopt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the learned Moehlheim, who thinks that by nature Aristotle meant nothing more than that \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, or animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, to which he attributes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>, and of which he expressly says that all things are full. Be De Generatione Animalium lib. iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. ii., this as it may, he always joins God and nature together, and affirms that they do nothing in vain. The same doctrine was taught before him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, who affirms that \"nature, together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, and according to it, orders all things.\" It must not, however, be concealed, that Plato seems to have attributed intelligence to the principle by which he supposed the world to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>; for Chalcidius, commenting on the Timaeus, thus expresses himself: \"Hec est illa ratione... <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. 53. velles anima mundi, quae gemina juxta meliorem naturam veneratione tutelam praebet infernibus, divinis dispositionibus obsequens, providentiam nativis impertiens, eorum similitudine propter cognitionem beatam.\"\u2014Apologeticus, tells us, \"Ilam coelestem animam, fontem animarum omnium, optimam virtutem effe genetricem, subferviri etiam Fabricatoris Deo, et pretio effe ad omnium inventione ejus.\" Plato pronunciavit.\n\nThe doctrine of Plato has been adopted by many moderns of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> both for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and for learning. The celebrated Berkeley bishop of Cloyne, after giving the view of Plato's anima mundi, which the reader will find in our article MOTION, No. 12, thus recommends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>: \"If that philosopher himself was not read only, but studied also with care, and made his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPRETER\">interpreter</a>, I believe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> that now lies against him would soon wear off, or be even converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem, for those excellent notions, and fine hints, that sparkle and shine throughout his writings; which seem to contain not only the most valuable learning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and Greece, but also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> of the most remote traditions and early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>.\" Cudworth, and the learned author of Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, are likewise strenuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for the Aristotelian doctrine of a plastic nature diffused through the material world; (see Metaphysics, No. 200, 201, 202.) and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> very similar has lately occurred.\noccurred to a writer who does not appear to have borrowed it either from the Lyceum or the Academy.\n\nThis writer is Mr Young, of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> fulgence, and its agency in moving bodies, some account has been given elsewhere, (see Motion). As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> unconscious agent, immaterial, and, as he expresses himself, immental, it bears a striking resemblance to the phyletic nature or vegetable life of Cudworth; but the author holds it to be not only the principle of motion, but also the basis or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FULCRUM\">fulcrum</a> of matter itself; in the production of which, by certain motions, it may be said to be more strictly plastic than the hylarchical principle, or vis gentrix, of any other philosopher with whose writings we have any acquaintance. Though this opinion be singular, yet as its author is evidently a man who thinks for himself, unawed by the authority of celebrated names, and as one great part of the utility of such works as ours consists in their serving as indexes to science and literature, we shall lay before our readers a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the reasonings by which Mr Young endeavours to support his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, and we shall take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of remarking upon those reasonings as we proceed.\n\nThe author, after a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a>, enters upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> intitled, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of Matter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>. In that chapter there is little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>. He treats, as others have done, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> and secondary qualities, and adheres too closely to the language of Locke, when he says, that \"the nature of bodies signifies the aggregate of all those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> with which they furnish us, and by which they are made known.\" To say the best of it, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> is inaccurately expressed. An aggregate of ideas may be occasioned by the impulse of bodies on the organs of sense, but the effect of impulse cannot be that which impels. We should not have made this remark, which may perhaps be deemed captious, were we not persuaded that the vague and inaccurate use of terms is the source of those mistakes into which, we cannot help thinking, that the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author has sometimes fallen. Having justly observed, that we know nothing directly of bodies but their qualities, he proceeds to investigate the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>.\n\n\"Solidity (he says) is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of body which principally requires our notice. It is that which fills <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, and which resists other solids, occupying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which it occupies; thus making extension and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> real, and different from mere space and vacuity. If the fe-\n\n---\n\n(A) We can only conceive of solidity as being a resistance of the parts of any body, to a power which endeavours to separate them, or to bring them nearer together. Now that which resists any power, and prevents its effect, is also a power. By resistance, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> here an active resistance, such as an animal can employ against an animal. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> pulls against a load, he draws it along; but if he draws against another horse, he is put to a stand, and his endeavor is defeated. When any endeavor to change the situation of the parts of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> is in like manner prevented from taking effect, and the parts retain their situation, the situation has plainly been preserved by an active resistance or power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to that which was fruitlessly exerted on them.\"\n\nSuch is our author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> to prove that matter is essentially active, and that from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> results our notion of its solidity: but does he not here confound solidity with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, and impenetrability with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>? He certainly does; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is as solid, in the proper sense of the word, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAMANT\">adamant</a>, and the particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> as the particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. The parts of water are, indeed, separated with ease, and those of adamant with difficulty; but it is not because the latter have more solidity than the former, but because the power of cohesion, whatever it may be, operates upon them with greater force. Solidity is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> of a whole; hardness and softness result from the cohesion of parts. We do not at all perceive the propriety of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> of the horse pulling a load, and afterwards pulling against another horse. Is it because both horses are active that one of them cannot prevail against the other, and because the load is inactive that either of them may drag along a mass of iron of half a ton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>?\nwhich we do not perceive the force, attempted to prove that it is by an inward power, and not by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a>, that one body prevents another from occupying the same place with itself; he naturally enough infers matter to be essentially active. \"But the activity of matter is to be considered in a certain limited sense, and its inertness is to be regarded in another limited sense; so that these are compatible within their respective limits. The activity of body may be considered as belonging to the parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>; its inertia as the inertia formed of those parts. The actions of the parts are everywhere opposed to each other, and equal; and hence results the inactivity of the whole.\"\n\nSolidity alone of the primary qualities being positive, and peculiar to bodies, and our author having resolved this into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> or power, it follows, by his analysis, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of body is reduced to power likewise. But, as he properly observes, power is an idea of reflection, not acquired by the senses, but suggested by thought. Hence our knowledge of real existence in body must be such as is suggested to us by our thoughts exercised about our sensations. \"We are capable of acting and producing changes in appearances; and this faculty, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to exist in ourselves, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> power. We are conscious of the exertion of our own power; and therefore, when we see action or change happen without any exertion of ours, we refer this to other powers without us, and necessarily conclude the power to exist where the change begins or the action is exerted. This power, then, referred to bodies, must exist in them, or it can exist nowhere.\"\n\nIn two chapters, which might easily have been compressed into one not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the shortest of them, our author analyzes atoms or the primary particles of matter, and strenuously opposes their impenetrability. He allows that there are atoms of matter not divisible by any known force; but as these, however small, must be conceived as having extension, each of them must be composed of parts held together by the same power which binds together many atoms in the same body. This power, indeed, he acknowledges to operate much more forcibly when it cements the parts of a primary atom than when it makes many atoms cohere in one mass; but still it operates in the same manner: and as the ideal analysis may be carried on ad infinitum, the only positive idea which is suggested by atoms, or the parts of atoms, is the idea of a resisting power. That this power of resistance, which constitutes what is vulgarly called the solidity of bodies, may not be absolutely impenetrable, he attempts to prove, by showing that resistance does in fact take place in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where impenetrability, and even solidity, are not supposed by any man.\n\n\"Let us endeavour (says he) to bring together two like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> of a magnet, and we shall experience a resistance to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a>. Why, then, may not a piece of iron, which between our fingers resists their coming together, result by an efficacy perfectly similar, though more strongly exerted? If <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon our bodies as upon iron, we should feel it; or were magnets endowed with sensation, they would feel that which resists their nearer approach. The resisting extension between the two magnets is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERMEABLE\">permeable</a> to all the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and reflecting none is therefore unseen; but it is easy to conceive that the same power which resists the approach of the iron might resist and reflect some rays of light. We should then have a visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> interposed between the two magnets, as we have before supposed it might be a tangible one. It is likewise easy to conceive that which is tangible and visible so applied to our organs of tasting, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SMELLING\">smelling</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>, as to excite ideas of flavours, odours, and sounds. Thus we see that an action, in which no supposition of solidity or impenetrability is involved, may be conceived to assume all the qualities of matter, by only supposing a familiar effect extended in its operation.\"\n\nThis reasoning is exceedingly ingenious, though perhaps not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>; but what is of more importance, it does not approach so near to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> as the author seems to imagine. If magnets operate by means of a fluid issuing from them (see Magnetism), those who hold the solidity or impenetrability of matter will maintain, that each atom of the magnetic fluid is solid and impenetrable. That we do not see nor feel these atoms, will be considered as no argument that they do not exist; for we do not see, nor in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> room feel, the atoms of the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; which yet Mr Young will acknowledge to have a real existence, and to be capable of operating upon our senses of hearing and smelling. Let us, however, suppose, that by this reasoning he has established the non-existence of every thing in the primary atoms of matter but active powers of resistance, and let us see how he conceives the actions of these powers to constitute what gives us the notion of inert and solid body; for that we have such a notion cannot be denied.\n\nTo act he allows to be an attribute, and justly observes, that we cannot conceive an attribute to exist without a substance. \"But (says he) we have traced all phenomena to action as to a generic idea, comprehending under it all forms of matter and motion as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>. By this analysis, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> idea we usually denominated matter, and considered as the substance or substratum to which motion appertained as an attribute, is found to change its character, and to be itself an attribute of a substance essentially active, of which one modification of motion produces matter and another generates motion.\" The action of this substance Mr Young determines to be motion, (see Motion, No. 16.) and he proceeds to inquire by what kind of motion it produces matter, or inert and resisting atoms.\n\n\"Whatever portion of the active substance is given to form an atom, the following things are necessary to be united in such portion of active substance: 1stly, It must in some respect continually move; for otherwise it would lose its nature, and cease to be active. 2ndly, It must also in some other respect be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, for otherwise it could not form an inactive atom. 3rdly, It must preserve unity within itself.\" The author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>\n\nIf so, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> or triple the mass, and a very strange phenomenon will be the result; for we shall have an active whole compounded of two or three inactive parts, even though those parts should not be in contact!\nproof of the first of these positions we have given elsewhere. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> he holds to be self-evident; and the third he thinks established by the following reasoning: \"Solidity is the result of those actions among the parts of any whole, whereby the unity of the whole is preserved within itself. Several uncohering things may be united by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> bond: this does not constitute these one solid; it may be one bundle: but if several things cohere, and have a unity preserved within themselves, they become one solid. An atom is the least and most simple solid.\"\n\nHaving thus proved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of these three requisites to the formation of an atom, he observes, that \"the two first can only be united in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of the portion of active substance about a centre or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> at rest. By such a motion, all the parts successively occupy different places in the orbit of rotation, and therefore move; the centre round which they revolve being at rest, the whole portion is also at rest; and thus the portion is at once moving and quiescent, as is required. The same kind of motion will also fulfill the terms of the third requisite; for a substance having a revolving motion around its own centre, preserves its unity by reason of all the parts preserving the same relation to the centre: and further, a motion of the active substance about a centre or axis will be an activity in the same orbit, which will act upon and resist whatever shall interfere to oppose its activity, or destroy the unity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, by diverting the course of the revolving motions. The activity or motion of a portion of active substance about a centre will, therefore, give solidity to such portion; for it will give it unity and resistance, and in a manner tie together all the parts, forming them into one mass about their common centre: for they move or are active not towards the centre, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> they would be lost in non-extension; nor from the centre, where they would dilate in boundless space; but about the centre, preserving the same limits of extension: and being in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> active, they in this way resist any other activity opposed to them, that is, they resist any action which tends to penetrate or divide this sphere of revolving activity. Therefore, since any portion of active substance does, by revolving about a centre, become an united, resisting, and quiescent whole, the smallest portions of the active substance which have such motions will become atoms, or make the smallest portions of matter.\"\n\nHaving thus shown to his own satisfaction how atoms of matter are formed, he next explains what at first he confesses may have appeared a paradox, \"how the active substance, retaining its own nature and essential properties, continuing immaterial, unfold, and active, puts on at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the form of matter, and becomes material, solid, and inert. A sphere of revolving active substance, as it revolves continually about a centre, and as parts of the substance, are considered as successively passing through every point in the orbit; considered thus in its parts, and in its motions, it is active substance, immaterial, and unfold; but the whole sphere, considered unitically, collectively, and as quiescent, is in this point of view a solid atom, material, and inert.\"\n\nSuch is the active substance of Mr Young, and such his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the formation of matter. That he has not with fertility copied from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, every reader of his book, who is not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> stranger to Greek and Roman literature, will readily acknowledge; and yet if his theory be well founded, he has discovered a middle substance between mind and matter, more properly plastic than Aristotle or Plato, Cudworth or Berkeley, ever conceived. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> compels us to add, that to us his theory appears to labour under infuperable objections. That there may be in the universe a substance essentially active, and at the same time not intelligent, is a proposition which we are by no means inclined to controvert. Various phenomena, both in vegetable and animal life, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to suspect that there is such a substance; but it does not follow that we are inclined to adopt our author's doctrine respecting the formation of matter. He conceives his proof, indeed, to be \"in its nature not at all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of demonstration;\" and if any one refuse it, he thinks it will be necessary for him to show, either that the explanation offered is not sufficient, or that some other explanation will serve equally well.\"\n\nTo show that the explanation offered is not sufficient, will not, we apprehend, be a very arduous task; but we have no inclination to attempt ourselves another explanation, because we believe that of the formation of matter no other account can be given than that which resolves it into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIAT\">fiat</a> of the Creator. That it cannot be formed by the motion of an immaterial substance in the manner which our author has very clearly described, seems to be a truth so evident as not to admit of proof; for if motion be, as he defines it, a change of place, every thing that is moved must have the quality of extension. But all the parts of this active substance which are given to form an atom, move round a centre, and are expressly said to occupy successively different places in the orbit of rotation. Every one of these parts, therefore, is an extended being: and since, according to our author, solidity is nothing but an active power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>, and the parts of this active substance, in their rotation round their centre, act upon and repel whatever interferes to oppose their activity, it follows that each of these parts is likewise a solid being. But, in the opinion of Mr Young himself, and of all mankind, whatever is extended and solid is material. This theory, therefore, exhibits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in which atoms are formed of a substance, which, though it is said to be active, immaterial, and unfold, appears, when narrowly inspected, to be nothing else than a collection of those very atoms of which the author pretends to explain the formation. Mr Young, who examines and very freely censures some of the doctrines of Newton and others, is too much a man of science to be offended at us for stating objections to a theory which is quite new, to a transformation which he himself acknowledges may to many \"appear not only problematical and difficult to conceive, but wholly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, and implying contradictions absolutely and forever irreconcilable.\" Whether this be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> character of it our readers must determine; but if we did not believe the author to be a man of ingenuity, we should not have introduced him or his work to their acquaintance.\n\nPlastic Art, the art of representing all sorts of figures by the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is derived from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, which signifies the \"art of forming, modelling, or casting, in a mould.\" A mould in general is a body that is made hollow for that purpose. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> makes use of it to form figures in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>,\nbronze, lead, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, or any other metal or fusible substance. The mould is made of clay, stucco, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and is hollowed into the form of the figure that is to be produced; they then apply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a>, which is a sort of funnel, through which the metal is poured that is to form the figures, and that is called running the metal into the mould.\n\nIt is in this manner, but with much practice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, that the artist forms, 1. Equestrian and pedetrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of every kind; 2. Groups; 3. Pedestals; 4. Bas-reliefs; 5. Medallions; 6. Cannons, mortars, and other pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>; 7. Ornaments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, as capitals, bases, &c.; 8. Various sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, as lutes, branches, &c., in every kind of metal; and in the same manner figures are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in stucco, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, or any other fusible matter. See PLASTER OF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">PARIS</a>.\n\nWax being a substance that is very easily put in fusion, plasters make much use of it. There are impressions which are highly pleasing in coloured wax, of medallions, bas-relief alto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIEVO\">relievo</a>, and of detached figures; which, however, are somewhat brittle. But this matter has been carried too far: they have not only formed moulds to represent the likeness and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUST\">bust</a> of a living <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, by applying the plaster to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> itself, and afterwards casting melted wax into the mould; but they have also painted that waxen bust with the natural colours of the face, and have then applied glass eyes and natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>; to which they have joined a stuffed body and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of wax; and have, lastly, dressed their figure in a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; and by these means have produced an object the most shocking and detestable that it is possible to conceive. It is not a statue, a bust, a natural resemblance that they form; but a dead body, a lifeless countenance, a mere carcass. The stiff air, the inflexible muscles, the haggard eyes of glass, all contribute to produce an object that is hideous and disagreeable to every man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Figures like these offend by affording too exact an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of nature. In no one of the polite arts ought imitation ever to approach so near the truth as to be taken for nature herself. Illusion must have its bounds; without which it becomes ridiculous.\n\nThere is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> far more ingenious and pleasing, which is that wherein M. Lippart, antiquary and artist at Dresden, has so much excelled. He has found the means of resembling, by indefatigable labour, great expense, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> taste, that immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, engraved and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CAMEO\">cameo</a>, which are to be seen in the most celebrated cabinets. He has made choice of those that are the most beautiful; and, with a plaster of his own invention, he takes from these stones an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> that is surprisingly accurate, and which afterwards become as marble: these impressions he calls pastes. He then gives them a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and incloses each with a gold rim; and, by ranging them in a judicious order, forms them an admirable system. They are fixed on pasteboards, which form so many drawers, and are then inclosed in cases, which represent folio volumes, and have titles wrote on their backs; so that these fictitious books may conveniently occupy a place in a library. Nothing can be more ingenious than this invention; and, by means of it, persons of moderate fortune are enabled to make a complete collection of all antiquity has left that is excellent of this kind; and the copies are very little inferior to the originals.\n\nThere is also another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of taking the impressions of cameos, medals, and coins, which is as follows: They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> or properly clean the piece whose impression is to be taken, and surround it with a border of wax. They then dissolve sealing-wax in water, and make a decoction of it, mixing with it some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, to give it an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour. They pour this paste, when hot, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or medal, to the thickness of about the tenth part of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>; they then leave it exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, in a place free from dust. After a few days this paste becomes hard, and offers to the eye the most admirable and faithful representation of the medal that it is possible to conceive: they are then carefully placed in drawers; and thousands of these impressions, which comprehend many ages, may be included in a small compass.\n\nThe proficient in plasters have likewise invented the art of casting in a mould papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 or dissolved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and forming it into figures in imitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, of ornaments and decorations for ceilings, furniture, &c., and which they afterwards paint or gild. There are, however, some inconveniences attending this art; as, for example, the imperfections in the moulds, which render the contours of the figures inelegant, and give them a heavy air: these ornaments, moreover, are not so durable as those of bronze or wood, seeing that in a few years they are preyed on by the worm.\n\nThe figures that are given to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a>, Delft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, &c., belong also to plasters; for they are formed by moulds, as well as by the art of the sculptor and turner; and by all these arts united are made vases of every kind, figures, groups, and other designs, either for use or ornament.\n\nFrom this general article the reader is referred to FOUNDRY, CAST, GLAZING, PORCELAIN, PAPIER-M\u00c2CH\u00c9, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTTERY\">POTTERY</a>, DELFT WARE.","sp":245,"ep":249},{"h":"PLATA","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> river of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, running through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Paraguay; whence the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is sometimes called Plata; though this name is usually bestowed only upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Paraguay.

The great river La Plata, from which the country has its name, was first discovered, in 1515, by Juan Diaz de Solis; but denominated La Plata by Sebastian Caboto, from the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> he procured from the adjacent inhabitants, imagining it was the produce of the country, though in fact they brought it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>.\n\nThe country lies between 32\u00b0 and 37\u00b0 of south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is pleasant and healthy.

Sometimes, when they cannot vend their hides, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> kill them for their tongues; and those who care not to be at the trouble to fetch them from the plains, may buy them for a trifle.

Horses are also numerous, and in common like the other cattle; so that a man may have as many as he pleases for the catching; and of those that are already broke, one may buy some of the best, and of the true Spanish breed, for a piece-of-eight per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. Wild fowl also is in great plenty here; partridges in particular are more numerous, and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and tame as our hens, so that one may kill them with a stick. Their wheat makes the finest and whitest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>; and, in a word, they seem to want for nothing here, especially the natives, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>.

A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> is the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that can be allowed to draw the horse's body clear, and to refine his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> that is attainable by art.\n\nIt is first necessary to take an exact view of his body, whether he be low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>; and it is also necessary to consider whether he be dull and heavy, or brisk and lively when abroad. If he appear dull and heavy, and there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to suppose it is owing to too hard riding, or, as the jockeys express it, to some gout that has been dissolved in hunting, and has not been removed by scouring, then the proper remedy is half an ounce of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAPENTE\">diapente</a> given in a pint of good sack; this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> at once remove the canic, and revive the creature's spirits. After this, for the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> of the month, he is to be fed with oats, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, and split beans; giving him sometimes the one and sometimes the other as he likes best; and always leaving some in the locker, that he may feed at leisure when he is left alone. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOM\">groom</a> returns at the feeding-time, whatever is left of this must be removed, and fresh given; by this means the creature will soon become high-spirited, wanton, and full of play. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> he must be rode out an airing, and every other day it will be proper to give him a little more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>; but not so much as to make him sweat too much. The beans and oats in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> are to be put into a bag, and beaten till the hulls are all off, and then winnowed clean; and the bread, instead of being chipped in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, is to have the crust clean cut off. If the horse be in good flesh and spirits when taken up for its month's preparation, the diapente must be omitted; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> business will be to give him good food, and to much exercise as will keep him in wind, without overwearing him or tiring his spirits. When he takes larger exercises afterwards, towards the end of the month, it will be proper to have some horses in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to run against him. This will put him upon his mettle, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> them will give him spirits. This, however, is to be cautiously observed, that he has not a bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> given him for ten days or a fortnight before the plate is to be run for; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> heat that is given him the day before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, must be in his clothes: this will make him run with greatly more vigour, when stripped for the race, and feeling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> wind on every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> week, the horse should have the same food,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLATING\">PLATING</a> is the art of covering baser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> with a thin plate of silver either for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> or for ornament. It is said to have been invented by a spur-maker, not for show but for real utility. Till then the more elegant spurs in common use were made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> silver, and from the flexibility of that metal they were liable to be bent into inconvenient forms by the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>. To remedy this defect, a workman at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a> contrived to make the branches of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of spurs hollow, and to fill that hollow with a slender rod of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. Finding this a great improvement, and being desirous to add cheapness to utility, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make the hollow larger, and of course the iron thicker and thicker, till at last he discovered the means of coating an iron spur with silver in such a manner as to make it equally elegant with those which were made wholly of that metal. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> was quickly applied to other purposes; and to numberless utensils which were formerly made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> or iron are now given the strength of these metals, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of silver, for a small additional expense.","sp":250,"ep":251},{"h":"PLATEBAND","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">Gardening</a>, a border <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, along a wall, or the side of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTERRE\">parterre</a>, frequently edged with box, &c.\n\nPLATEBAND of a door or window, is used for the lintel, where that is made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, or not much marked.","sp":250,"ep":250},{"h":"PLATO","t":"an illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of antiquity, was by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> an Athenian, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his birth was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Egina. His lineage through his father is traced back to Codrus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, and through his mother to Solon the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his birth is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> placed in the beginning of the 88th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>; but Dr Enfield thinks it may be more accurately fixed in the third year of the 87th Olympiad, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 432 years before the Christian era. He gave early indications of an extensive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, and had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> suitable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, being instructed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of letters by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a> Dionysius, and trained in athletic exercises by Aristo of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>. He applied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> diligence to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; and made such proficiency in the latter, as to produce an epic poem, which, upon comparing it with the poems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, he committed to the flames. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 20 he composed a dramatic piece; but after he had given it to the performers, happening to attend upon a discourse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, he was so captivated by his eloquence, that he reclaimed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> without suffering it to be acted, renounced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, burnt all his poems, and applied himself wholly to the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>.\n\nIt is thought that Plato's first matters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> were Cratylus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERMOGENES\">Hermogenes</a>, who taught the systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERACLITUS\">Heraclitus</a> and Parmenides; but when he was 20 years old, he attached himself wholly to Socrates, with whom he remained eight years in the relation of a scholar. During this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, he frequently displeased his companions, and sometimes even his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAFTING\">grafting</a> upon the Socratic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> opinions which were taken from some other stock. It was the practice of the scholars of Socrates to commit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the substance of their master's discourses. Plato wrote them in the form of dialogues; but with so great additions of his own, that Socrates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> him recite his Lyfs, cried out, \"O <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>! how many things does this young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> feign of me!\"\n\nPlato, however, retained the warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to his master. When that great and good man was summoned before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, his illustrious scholar undertook to plead his cause, and begun a speech in his defense; but the partiality and violence of the judges would not permit him to proceed. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a>, he presented his master with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> sufficient to redeem his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; which, however, Socrates refused to accept. During his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>, Plato attended him, and was present at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> which he held with his friends concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>; the substance of which he afterwards committed to writing in the beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> intitled Phaedo, not, however, without interweaving his own opinions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.\n\nThe philosophers who were at Athens were so alarmed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Socrates, that most of them fled from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> to avoid the injustice and cruelty of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. Plato, whose grief upon this occasion is said by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a> to have been excessive, retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEGARA\">Megara</a>; where he was kindly entertained by Euclid, who had been one of Socrates's first scholars, till the storm was over. Afterwards he determined to travel in pursuit of knowledge; and from Megara he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, where he conferred with Eurytus, Philolaus, and Archytas. These were the most celebrated of the followers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, whose doctrine was then become famous in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; and from these the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a> have affirmed that he had all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy. He dived into the most profound and mysterious secrets of the Pythagorean doctrines; and perceiving other knowledge to be connected with them, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, where he learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> of Theodorus the mathematician. From thence he passed into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, to acquaint himself with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> of their priests, to study more nicely the proportions of geometry, and to instruct himself in astronomical observations; and having taken a full survey of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he settled for some time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Sais, learning of the wise men there, what they held concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, whether it had a beginning, whether it moved wholly or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, &c.; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAULINUS\">Paulinus</a> affirms, that he learned from these the immortality, and also the transmigration, of souls. Some of the fathers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have it, that he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the books of Moses, and that he studied under a learned Jew of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELIOPOLIS\">Heliopolis</a>; but there is nothing that can be called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> for these assertions. St Austin once believed that Plato had some conference with Jeremiah; but afterwards discovered, that that prophet must have been dead at least 60 years before Plato's voyage to Egypt.\n\nPlato's curiosity was not yet satisfied. He travelled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> to consult the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGI\">magi</a> about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of that country; and he designed to have penetrated even to the Indies, and to have learned of the Brachmans their manners and customs; but the wars in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> prevented him.\n\n\"He then returned into Italy, to the Pythagorean school at Tarentum, where he endeavoured to improve his own system, by incorporating with it the doctrine of Pythagoras, as it was then taught by Archytas, Timaeus, and others. And afterwards, when he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, he retained such an attachment to the Italic school, that, through the bounty of Dionysius, he purchased at a vast price several books which contained the doctrine of Pythagoras, from Philolaus, one of his followers.\n\n\"Returning home richly stored with knowledge of various kinds, Plato settled in Athens, and executed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, which he had doubtless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> had in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, of forming a new school for the instruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> in the principles of philosophy. The place which he made choice of for this purpose was a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a>, called the Academy, from Hecadmus, who left it to the citizens for the purpose of gymnastic exercises. Adorned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and sepulchres, planted with lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>-trees, and intersected by a gentle stream, it afforded a delightful retreat for philosophy and the muses. Of this retreat Horace speaks:\n\nAtque\nAtque inter sylvas Academi quaere vereum.\n\n\"Midst Academic groves to search for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\"\n\nWithin this inclosure he possessed, as a part of his humble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a>, purchased at the price of three thousand drachmas, a small garden, in which he opened a school for the reception of those who might be inclined to attend his instructions. How much Plato valued mathematical studies, and how necessary a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> he thought them for higher speculations, appears from the inscription which he placed over the door of his school: \"Oubis ayos ergon houta.\" \"Let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one who is unacquainted with geometry enter here.\"\n\nThis new school soon became famous, and its master was ranked among the most eminent philosophers. His travels into distant countries, where learning and wisdom flourished, gave him celebrity among his brethren of the Socratic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. None of these had ventured to institute a school in Athens except Aristippus; and he had confined his instructions almost entirely to ethical subjects, and had brought himself into some discredit by the freedom of his manners. Plato alone remained to inherit the patrimony of public esteem which Socrates had left his disciples; and he possessed talents and learning adequate to his design of extending the study of philosophy beyond the limits within which it had been inclosed by his master. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, not only that young men crowded to his school from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, but that people of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> in every department frequented the academy. Even females, disguised in men's clothes, often attended his lectures. Among the illustrious names which appear in the catalogue of his followers are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DION\">Dion</a> the Syracusan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and the orators <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPERIDES\">Hyperides</a>, Lyscursus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a>, and Ilocrates.\n\nGreatness was never yet exempted from envy. The disingenuous reputation of Plato brought upon him the hatred of his former companions in the school of Socrates, and they loaded him with detraction and obloquy. It can only be ascribed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a> and he, though they relate the discourses of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> master, studiously avoid mentioning one another. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> the Cynic ridiculed Plato's doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> speculations. In the midst of these private censures, however, the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Plato daily increased; and several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, among which were the Arcadians and the Thessians, sent ambassadors with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> requests that he would come over, not only to instruct the young men in philosophy, but also to prescribe them laws of government. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENAICS\">Cyrenaics</a>, Syracusans, Cretans, and Eleans, sent also to him: he did not go to any of them, but gave laws and rules of governing to all. He lived frugally, yet soberly and chastely. He was a man of great virtues, and exceedingly affable; of which we need no greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, than his civil manner of conversing with the philosophers of his own times, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and envy were at their height. His behaviour to Diogenes is always mentioned in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. The Cynic was vastly offended, it seems, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of Plato, and used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> all opportunities of snarling at him. He dined one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> with other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, and, trampling upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPESTRY\">tapestry</a> with his dirty feet, uttered this brutish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARCASM\">sarcasm</a>, \"I trample upon the pride of Plato;\" to which Plato wisely replied, \"With greater pride.\"\n\nThe fame of Plato drew disciples to him from all parts; among whom were Speusippus an Athenian, his sister's son, whom he appointed his successor in the academy, and the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>.\n\nThe admiration of this illustrious man was not confined to the breasts of a few philosophers. He was in high esteem with several princes, particularly Archelaus king of Macedon, and Dionysius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of Sicily. At three different periods he visited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of this latter prince, and made several bold but unsuccessful attempts to subdue his haughty and tyrannical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> relation of the particulars of these visits to Sicily may serve to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> upon the character of our philosopher; and we shall give it in the words of Dr Enfield, from whose elegant history of philosophy we have extracted by much the most valuable parts of this article.\n\nThe professed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of Plato's first visit to Sicily, which happened in the 40th year of his age, during the reign of the elder Dionysius the son of Hermocrates, was, to take a survey of the island, and particularly to observe the wonders of Mount Aetna. Whilst he was resident at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, he was employed in the instruction of Dion, the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, who possessed excellent abilities, though hitherto restrained by the terrors of a tyrannical government, and relaxed by the luxuries of a licentious court. Disgusted by the debauched manners of the Syracusans, he endeavoured to rescue his pupil from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> depravity. Nor did Dion disappoint his preceptor's expectations. No sooner had he received a taste of that philosophy which leads to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, than he was fired with an ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of wisdom. Entertaining an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that philosophy might produce the same effect upon Dionysius, he took great pains to procure an interview between Plato and the tyrant. In the course of the conference, whilst Plato was discoursing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the security and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of virtue, and the miseries attending injustice and oppression, Dionysius, perceiving that the philosopher's discourse was levelled against the vices and cruelties of his reign, dismissed him with high displeasure from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>, and conceived a design against his life. It was not without great difficulty that Plato, by the assistance of Dion, made his escape. A vessel which had brought over Pollis, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELEGATE\">delegate</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, was fortunately at that time returning to Greece. Dion engaged Pollis to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the philosopher, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> him safely in his native country; but Dionysius discovered the design, and obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> from Pollis, that he would either put him to death or sell him as a slave upon the passage. Pollis accordingly sold him in the island of Aegina; the inhabitants of which were then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the Athenians. Plato could not long remain unnoticed: Anicerris, a Cyrenaic philosopher, who happened to be at that time in the island, discovered the stranger, and thought himself happy in an opportunity of showing his respect for so illustrious a philosopher: he purchased his freedom for 30 minae, or 84l. 10s. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> money, and sent him home to Athens. Repayment being afterwards offered to Anicerris by Plato's relations, he refused the money, saying, with that generous spirit which true philosophy always inspires, that he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the relations of Plato should engross to themselves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of serving him.\n\nAfter a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, Dionysius repented of his ill-\nplaced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, and wrote to Plato, earnestly requesting him to repair his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> by returning to Syracuse; to which Plato gave this high-minded answer, that philosophy would not allow him leisure to think of Dionysius. He was, however, prevailed upon by his friend Dion to accept of the tyrant's invitation to return to Syracuse, and take upon him the education of Dionysius the younger, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. He was received by Dionysius the reigning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> with every possible appearance of respect; but after feeling his friend banished, and being himself kept as a prisoner at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, he was by the tyrant sent back into his own country, with a promise that both he and Dion should be recalled at the end of the war in which the Sicilians were then engaged. This promise was not fulfilled. The tyrant wished for the return of Plato; but could not resolve to recall Dion. At last, however, having probably promised that the philosopher should meet his friend at the court of Syracuse, he prevailed upon Plato to visit that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> a third time. When he arrived, the king met him in a magnificent chariot, and conducted him to his palace. The Sicilians too rejoiced in his return; for they hoped that the wisdom of Plato would at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> over the tyrannical spirit of the prince. Dionysius seemed wholly divested of his former resentments, listened with apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to the philosopher's doctrine, and, among other expressions of regard, presented him with eighty talents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. In the midst of a numerous train of philosophers, Plato now possessed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> influence and authority in the court of Syracuse. Whilst Aristippus was enjoying himself in splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>; whilst Diogenes was freely indulging his acrimonious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>; and whilst Alcines was gratifying his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>;\u2014Plato supported the credit of philosophy with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, which his friends regarded as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of superior wisdom, but which his enemies imputed to pride. After all, it was not in the power of Plato to prevail upon Dionysius to adopt his system of policy, or to recall Dion from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>. Mutual distrust, after a short interval, arose between the tyrant and the philosopher; each suspected the other of evil designs, and each endeavoured to conceal his suspicion under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> of respect. Dionysius attempted to impede upon Plato by condescending attentions, and Plato to deceive Dionysius by an appearance of confidence. At length, the philosopher became so much dissatisfied with his situation, that he earnestly requested permission to return to Greece, which was at last granted him, and he was sent home loaded with rich presents. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to Athens, pausing through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIS\">Elis</a> during the celebration of the Olympic games, he was present at this general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the Greeks, and engaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\nFrom this narrative it appears, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> Plato visited the courts of princes, it was chiefly from the hope of seeing his ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of a republic realized; and that his talents and attainments rather qualified him to shine in the academy than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> or the senate.\n\nPlato, now restored to his country and his school, devoted himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, and spent the last years of a long life in the instruction of youth. Having enjoyed the advantage of an athletic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and lived all his days temperately, he arrived at the 81st, or according to some writers the 90th, year of his age, and died, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> decay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, in the first year of the hundred and eighth Olympiad. He passed his whole life in a state of celibacy, and therefore left no natural heirs, but transferred his effects by will to his friend Adiamantus. The grove and garden, which had been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of his philosophical labours, at last afforded him a sepulchre. Statues and altars were erected to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>; the day of his birth long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be celebrated as a festival by his followers; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> is to this day preserved in gems; but the most lasting monuments of his genius are his writings, which have been transmitted, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> injury, to the present times.\n\nThe character of this philosopher has always been high. Besides the advantages of a noble birth, he had a large and comprehensive understanding, a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and good taste, great evenness and sweetness of temper, all cultivated and refined by education and travel; so that it is no wonder if he was honoured by his countrymen, esteemed by strangers, and adored by his scholars. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> thought more highly of Plato than of all their philosophers; they always called him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> Plato; and they seemed relieved that his deficient should be more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a>. \"There are (says Apuleius) who assert Plato to have sprung from a more sublime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>; and that his mother Pericleone, who was a very beautiful woman, was impregnated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> in the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTRE\">spectre</a>.\" Plutarch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIDAS\">Suidas</a>, and others, affirm this to have been the common report at Athens. When he was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>, his father Aristo went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYMETTUS\">Hymettus</a>, with his wife and child, to sacrifice to the mutes; and while they were buried in the divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>, a swarm of bees came and distilled their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIPS\">lips</a>. This, says Tully, was considered as a prefigure of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> eloquence. Apuleius relates, that Socrates, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> before Plato was recommended to him, dreamed that a young swan flew from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPID\">Cupid</a>'s altar in the academy, and settled in his lap; thence soared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and delighted the gods with its music; and when Aristo the next day presented Plato to him, \"Friends (says Socrates), this is the twin of Cupid's academy.\" The Greeks loved fables: they show however in the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, what exceeding respect was paid to the memory of Plato. Tully perfectly adored him; tells us, how he was justly called by Panetius the divine, the most wise, the most sacred, the Homer of philosophers; entitled him to Atticus, Deus ille noster; thinks, that if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> had spoken Greek, he would have spoken in Plato's language, and made him so implicitly his guide in wisdom and philosophy, as to declare, that he had rather err with Plato than be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> with any one else. But, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> aside, Plato was certainly a very wonderful man, of a large and comprehensive mind, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> infinitely fertile, and of a most flowing and copious eloquence. Nevertheless, the strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of fancy prevailing in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> over judgement, he was too apt to soar beyond the limits of earthly things, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> in the imaginary regions of general and abstracted ideas; and on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, though there is always a greatness and fullness in his manner, he did not philosophize so much according to truth and nature as Aristotle, though Cicero did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to give him the preference.\n\nThe writings of Plato are all in the way of dialogue; where he seems to deliver nothing from himself, but every thing\nthing as the sentiments and opinions of others, of Socrates chiefly, of Timaeus, &c. He does not mention himself anywhere, except once in his Phaedo, and another time in his Apology for Socrates. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, as Aristotle observed, is betwixt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>; on which account, some have not scrupled to rank him with the poets. There is a better reason for doing than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of his style; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is often-times the offspring of imagination, instead of doctrines or truths deduced from nature. The first edition of Plato's works in Greek was put out by Aldus at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in 1513; but a Latin version of him by Marcellus Ficinus had been printed there in 1491. They were reprinted together at Lyons in 1588, and at Frankfort in 1602. The famous printer Henry Stephens, in 1578, gave a most beautiful and correct edition of Plato's works at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, with a new Latin version by Serranus, in three volumes folio; and this deservedly passes for the best edition of Plato; yet Serranus's edition is very exceptional, and in many respects, if not in all, inferior to that of Ficinus.","sp":252,"ep":255},{"h":"PLATONIC","t":"something that relates to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, his school-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, opinions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the like.

We are not to suppose that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> implied nothing more than that for every effect there must be a cause; for this is a proposition which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> controvert who understands the terms in which it is expressed; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> believed that a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> even to omnipotence, and that to the production of anything a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> is not less necessary than an efficient cause, (see Metaphysics, N\u00b0 264\u2014394.) That with respect to this important question, Plato agreed with his predecessors and contemporaries, appears evident to us from the whole tenor of his\n\nTimaeus. We agree with Dr Enfield* in thinking, that Platonism, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a>, which comprehends his whole doctrine on the subject of the formation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is so manifestly spoken of as eternally co-existing with God, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his doctrine could not have been mistaken by so many learned and able writers, had they not been seduced by the desire of establishing a coincidence of doctrine between the writings of Plato and Moses. It is certain that neither Cicero\u2020 nor Apuleius\u2021 nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCINOUS\">Alcinous</a>\u00a7 nor even the later commentator Lib. i. c. 6. Chalcidius, undertook their matter in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> than as admitting two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> and incorruptible principles, God and matter; to which we shall afterwards see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to add a third, namely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> quoted by those who maintain the contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> are by no means sufficient for their purpose. Plato, it is true, in his Timaeus, calls God the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> of the universe, and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHIST\">Sophist</a> speaks of him as \"forming animate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> beings, which did not before exist;\" but these expressions do not necessarily imply that this offspring of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> was produced from nothing, or that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> matter existed from which these new beings were formed. Through the whole dialogue of the Timaeus, Plato supposes two eternal and independent causes of all things; one, that by which all things are made, which is God; the other, that from which all things are made, which is matter. He distinguishes between God, matter, and the universe, and supposes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> of the world to have formed it out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of pre-existent matter. Matter, according to Plato, is an eternal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> principle. His doctrine on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is thus explained by Cicero ||. \"Matter, from which all things are produced and formed, is a substance without form or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, but capable of receiving all forms, and undergoing every kind of change; in which, however, it never suffers annihilation, but merely a solution of its parts, which are in their nature infinitely divisible, and move in portions of space which are also infinitely divisible. When that principle which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> quality is moved, and acts upon matter, it undergoes an entire change, and those forms are produced, from which arises the diversified and coherent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the universe.\" This doctrine Plato unfolds at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in his Timaeus, and particularly insists upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, that matter has originally no form, but is capable of receiving any. He calls it the mother and receptacle of forms, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of which with matter the universe becomes perceptible to the senses; and maintains, that the visible world owes its forms to the energy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> intellectual nature.\n\nOur author is supported in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> this inference by the testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> Laertius, who surely understood the language and dogmas of Plato better than the most accomplished modern scholar can pretend to do; yet a learned writer* has lately expressed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> surprise that any one should consider matter as having been, in Plato's opinion, uncreated; and he boldly affirms, that Laertius, instead of affirming that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> and matter were the principles of all things, ought to have said that God alone, in Plato's estimation, was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>.\u2014To prove this, he gives from the Timaeus a quotation, in which the founder of the academy declares that God framed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and the inferior deities; and that as he fashioned, so he pervades all nature. He observes, that Cicero denominates the god of\nPlatonism. Plato the maker, and the god of Aristotle only the governor, of the world. And, to satisfy those who may demand a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of Plato's having taught a real creation, he affirms that his writings abound with declarations on the subject, of which the meaning cannot be misapprehended. \"With this purpose (says he) Plato denominates at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the principles or substance of all things, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, the productions of the efficient Deity, and at others enters more particularly into the question. Thus, he observes, that many persons are ignorant of the nature and power of mind or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, 'as having existed at the beginning, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> to all bodies.' Of this mind, he observes, that it is without exception \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, of all things the most ancient; and he subjoins, in order to remove all doubt of his purpose, that it is also \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd, the cause or principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>.\"\n\nWith all possible respect for Dr Ogilvie, of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and erudition we are thoroughly convinced, we must take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to say, that to us the declarations of Plato on this subject appear much less precise and explicit than they appear to him; and that the inference which he would draw from the words of Cicero seems not to flow necessarily from the sense of those words. That Plato believed God to have framed the heaven and the earth, and to have fashioned all nature, is a position which, as far as we know, has never been controverted; but between framing or fashioning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a> or \u03bd\u1fe6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03bd, and calling the universe into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> from non-entity, there is an infinite and an obvious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> made by Cicero between the God of Plato and the God of Aristotle is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> distinction, but it will not bear the superstructure which the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> builds upon it. Aristotle maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a> of the world in its present form. Plato certainly taught that the first matter was in time reduced from a chaotic state into form by the power of the Demiurgus; but we have seen nothing in his writings which explicitly declares his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that the first matter was itself created.\n\nThe learned Cudworth, who wished, like Dr Ogilvie, to find a coincidence of doctrine between the theology of Plato and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">Gospel</a>, strained all his faculties to prove that his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> taught a proper creation; but he laboured in vain. He gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of quotations in support of his position; of which we shall here insert only two upon which Dr Ogilvie seems to lay the greatest stress. Plato, says the author of the Intellectual System, calls the one God (\u03b1) \u1f41 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f45\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \u1f02\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fc7 \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u2014He that makes earth, and heaven, and the gods, and doth all things both in heaven, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>, and under the earth. And, again, \"he by whole efficiency the things of the world (\u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u1fb3\u03bd \u03b5\u1f51\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7) were afterwards made when they were not before.\" Both Cudworth and Ogilvie think this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> an explicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of Plato's belief in the creative power of God; but that they are mistaken has been evinced by Motheim with a force of argument which will admit of no reply. In that part of the Sophist from which the quotation is taken, Plato considers the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, of which he is treating, as belonging both to God and to man; and he defines it in general to be \"a certain power which is the cause that things may afterwards be which were not before.\" Cudworth wishes to confine this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> to the divine power; and adds from himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a> which he quotes the following words, which are not in Plato, or FROM AN ANTECEDENT NON-EXISTENCE BROUGHT FORTH INTO BEING! That the incomparable author intended to deceive his reader, we are far from imagining: his zeal for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> had deceived himself. Plato's definition comprehends the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> of man as of God; and therefore cannot infer a creative power anywhere, unless the father of the academy was so very absurd as to suppose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> artists the creators of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> which they have invented and made! Motheim thinks that Cudworth was misled by too implicit a confidence in Ficinus; and it is not impossible that Dr Ogilvie may have been swayed by the authority, great indeed, of the author of the Intellectual System.\n\nThat intellect existed antecedent to all bodies is indeed a Platonic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a>, from which Dr Ogilvie, after Cudworth, wishes to infer that the doctrine of the creation was taught in the academy; but Dr Ogilvie knows, and no man knew better than Cudworth, that Plato, with every other Greek philosopher, distinguished between body and matter; and that though he held the priority of intellect to the former, it by no means follows that he believed it to have existed antecedent to the latter. That he believed mind, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> (for he distinguishes between the two), to be the cause or principle of motion, cannot be denied; but we are not therefore authorized to conclude, that he likewise believed it to be the cause of the existence of matter. That he believed mind to be the most ancient of all things, taking the word things in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sense, cannot be true, since by Dr Ogilvie's own acknowledgement he held the existence and eternity of ideas, not to add that he believed \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f22 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u2014the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOSTASIS\">hypostasis</a> in his trinity, to be superior to mind and prior to it, though not in time, yet in the order of nature. When therefore he calls mind the most ancient of all things, he must be supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> only, that it is more ancient than all bodies and inferior souls. It is no reflection on the character of Plato that he could not, by the efforts of his own reason, acquire any notion of a proper creation; since we, who have the advantage of his writings, and of\n\n(A) Motheim affirms that this quotation is nowhere to be found in the writings of Plato. He therefore at first suspected that the learned author, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> hastily over Plato's tenth book De Legibus, had transferred to God what is there said of the anima mundi, leading by its own motions every thing in the heaven, the earth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and that he had added something of his own. He dropped that opinion, however, when he found Plato, in the tenth book of his Republic, declaring it to be as easy for God to produce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, stars, and earth, &c. from himself, as it is for us to produce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of ourselves, and whatever else we please, only by interposing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-LOOKING_GLASS\">looking-glass</a>. In all this power, however, there is nothing similar to that of creation.\nPlatonism writings infinitely more valuable, to instruct us, find it extremely difficult, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not impossible, to conceive how any thing can begin to be. We believe the fact on the authority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>; but should certainly have never agitated such a question, had it not been stated to us by writers inspired with celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>.\n\nIn the Platonic cosmogony we cannot therefore doubt but that the eternity of the \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 was taken for granted. Whether it was an eternal and necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMANATION\">emanation</a> from an eternal mind, is not perhaps quite so evident, though our own opinion is, that it was believed to be self-existent. But be this as it may, which is not worth disputing, one thing is certain, that Plato did not believe it to have a single form or quality which it did not receive either from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-DEMIURGE\">Demiurge</a> or the Physis\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of this trinity. Except Aristotle, all the Greek philosophers, who were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIALISTS\">materialists</a>, held nearly the same opinions respecting the origin of the world; so that in examining their systems we shall be greatly misled if we understand the terms incorporeal and immaterial as at all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>. It was also a doctrine of Plato, that there is in matter a necessary but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> and refractory force; and that hence arises a propensity in matter to disorder and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>, which is the cause of all the imperfection which appears in the works of God, and the origin of evil. On this subject Plato writes with wonderful obscurity: but, as far as we are able to trace his conceptions, he appears to have thought, that matter, from its nature, resists the will of the Supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">Artificer</a>, so that he cannot perfectly execute his designs; and that this is the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of good and evil which is found in the material world.\n\nPlato, however, was no materialist. He taught, that there is an intelligent cause, which is the origin of all spiritual being, and the former of the material world. The nature of this great being he pronounced it difficult to discover, and when discovered, impossible to divulge. The existence of God he inferred from the marks of intelligence, which appear in the form and arrangement of bodies in the visible world: and from the unity of the material system he concluded, that the mind by which it was formed must be one. God, according to Plato, is the supreme intelligence, incorporeal, without beginning, end, or change, and capable of being perceived only by the mind. He certainly distinguished the Deity not only from body, and whatever has corporeal qualities, but from matter itself, from which all things are made. He also ascribed to him all those qualities which modern philosophers ascribe to immaterial substance: and conceived him to be in his nature simple, unencumbered in space, the author of all regulated motion, and, in fine, possessed of intelligence in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\nHis notions of God are indeed exceedingly refined, and such as it is difficult to suppose that he could ever have acquired but from some obscure remains of primeval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, gleaned perhaps from the priests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> or from the philosophers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a>. In the Divine Nature he certainly believed that there are two, and probably that there are three, hypostases, whom he called Platonic, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f72\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f72\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2. The first he considered as self-existent, and elevated far above all mind and all knowledge; calling him, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, the being, or the one. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> which he acknowledged in this person was goodness; and therefore he frequently styles him \u1f41 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2\u2014the good, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> goodness. The second he considered as mind, the wisdom or reason of the first, and the maker of the world; and therefore he styles him \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. The third he always speaks of as the soul of the world; and hence calls him \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, or \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5. He taught that the second is a necessary emanation from the first, and the third from the second, or perhaps from the first and second.\n\nSome have indeed pretended, that the Trinity, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called Platonic, was a fiction of the later Platonists, unknown to the founder of the school: but any person who shall take the trouble to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the writings of Plato, will find abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that he really affected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIAD\">triad</a> of divine hypostases, all concerned in the formation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the world. Thus in his tenth book of Laws, where he undertakes to prove the existence of a Deity in opposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">atheists</a>, he ascends no higher in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> than to the \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 or mundane soul, which he held to be the immediate and proper cause of all the motion that is in the world. But in other parts of his writings he frequently affects, as superior to the self-moving principle, an immoveable \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 or intellect, which was properly the demiurge or framer of the world; and above this hypostasis one most simple and absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> being, who is considered in his Theology as \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 the original deity, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> from the others, who are only \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9. These doctrines are to be gathered from his works at large, particularly from the Timaeus, Philotheus, Sophista and Euthyphro; but there is a passage in his second epistle to Dionysius, apparently written in answer to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, in which that monarch had required him to give a more explicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> than he had formerly done of the nature of God, in which the doctrine of a Trinity seems to be directly asserted. \"After having said that he meant to wrap up his meaning in such obscurity, as that an adept only should fully comprehend it, he adds expressions to the following import: 'The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> of Nature is surrounded on all sides by his works: whatever is exists by his permission: he is the fountain and source of excellence: around the second person are placed things of the second order; and around the third those of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> (B).\" Of this obscure passage a very satisfactory explanation is given in Dr Ogilvie's Theology of Plato, to which the narrow limits prescribed to such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> as this compel us to refer the reader. We shall only say, that the account which we have given of the Platonic trinity is ably supported by the doctor.\n\nIn treating of the eternal emanation of the second and third hypostases from the first, the philosophers of the academy compare them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> proceeding from the sun. Plato himself, as quoted by Dr Cudworth, illustrates his doctrine by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>.\n\n(B). \"\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd, \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u1f10\u03be \u1f18\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9. \u1f18\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd. \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u1ff3. Oper. p. 1269.\"\nFor \"\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\" or the first hypostasis, is in the intellectual world the same (he says) to intellect and intelligibles that the sun is in the corporeal world to vision and visibles; for as the sun is not vision itself but the cause of vision, and as that light by which we see is not the sun but only a thing like the sun; so neither is the Supreme or Highest Good properly knowledge, but the cause of knowledge; nor is intellect, considered as such, the best and most perfect being, but only a being having the form of perfection.\" Again, \"as the sun causes other things not only to become visible but also to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>; so the Supreme Good gives to things not only their capability of being known, but also their very essences by which they subsist; for this fountain of the Deity, this highest good, is not itself properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a>, but above essence, transcending it in respect both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and of power.\"\n\nThe resemblance which this trinity of Plato bears to that revealed in the gospel must be observed by every attentive reader; but the two doctrines are likewise in some respects exceedingly dissimilar. The third hypostasis in the Platonic system appears in no point of view co-ordinate with the first or second. Indeed the first is elevated far above the second, and the third funk still farther beneath it, being considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> soul immersed in matter, and forming with the corporeal world, to which it is united, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> animal. Nay, it does not appear perfectly clear, that Plato considered his \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 as a pure spirit, or as having subsisted from eternity as a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">Hypothesis</a>. \"This governing spirit, of whom the earth, properly so called, is the body, consisted, according to our author's philosophy, of the same and the other; that is, of the first matter, and of pure intelligence, framed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUATE\">actuate</a> the machinery of nature. The Supreme Being placed him in the middle of the earth; which, in the vivid idea of Plato, seemed itself to live, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an influence that was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> in every part of it. From this seat his power is represented as being extended on all sides to the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of the heavens; conferring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and preserving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> in the various and complicated parts of the universe. Upon this being God is said to have looked with peculiar complacency after having formed him as an image of himself, and to have given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the mansion which he was destined to occupy. According to the doctrine of Timaeus, the Supreme Being struck out from this original mind innumerable spirits of inferior order, endowed with principles of reason; and he committed to divinities of secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> the task of investing these in material forms, and of dispersing them as inhabitants of the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies. He taught also, that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> the human soul is reunited to the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, as to the source from which it originally came.\"\n\nSuch is the third person of the Platonic triad, as we find his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> and attributes very accurately stated by Dr Ogilvie; and the Christian philosopher, who has no particular system to support, will not require another proof that the triad of Plato differs exceedingly from the Trinity of the Scriptures. Indeed the third hypostasis in this triad has so much the appearance of all that the ancients could mean by that which we call a creature, that the learned Cudworth, who wished, it is difficult to conceive for what reason, to find the sublime mystery of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> explicitly taught in the writings of a pagan philosopher, was forced to suppose that Plato held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2, or soul, one \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 incorporated with the material world, and the other \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 or supramundane, which is not the soul but the governor of the universe. We call this a mere hypothesis; for though the author displays vast erudition, and adduces many quotations in which this double \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 is plainly mentioned, yet all those quotations are taken from Platonists who lived after the propagation of the gospel, and who, calling themselves eclectics, freely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOLE\">stole</a> from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> such dogmas as they could incorporate with their own system, and then attributed those dogmas to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. In the writings of Plato himself, there is not so much as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to this supramundane \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2; and it is for this reason (the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2, of which he treats being so very inferior to the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff3) that we have expressed with hesitation his \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. Yet that he did admit so many, seems more than probable both from the passage illustrated by Dr Ogilvie, and from the attempt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOTINUS\">Plotinus</a>, one of his followers, to demonstrate that the number can be neither greater nor less. That his doctrine on this subject should be inaccurate and erroneous, can excite no wonder; whilst it must be confessed to have such a resemblance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and to be incapable of being proved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> from effects to causes, that we could not doubt of his having inherited it by tradition, even though we had not complete evidence that something very similar to it was taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before him, not only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> and Parmenides, but by the philosophers of the east.\n\nWe have said that the Demiurgus was the maker of the world from the first matter which had existed from eternity; but in Plato's cosmogony there is another principle, more mysterious, if possible, than any thing which we have yet mentioned. This is his intellectual system of ideas, which it is not easy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> from his writings, whether he considered as independent existences, or only as archetypal forms, which had subsisted from eternity in the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 or divine intellect. On this subject he writes with such exceeding obscurity, that men of the first eminence, both among the ancients and the moderns, have differed about his real meaning. Some have supposed, that by ideas he meant real beings subsisting from eternity, independent of all minds, and separate from all matter; and that of these ideas he conceived some to be living and others to be without life. In this manner his doctrine is interpreted by Tertullian among the ancients, and by the celebrated Brucker among the moderns; and not by them only, but by many others equally learned, candid, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a>. Cudworth, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, with his annotator Mosheim, contend, that by his ideal world Plato meant nothing more than that there existed from eternity in the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 or mind of God a notion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of every thing which was in time to be made. This is certainly much more probable in itself, than that a man of enlarged understanding should have supposed, that there are somewhere in extramundane space real living incorporeal beings eating and drinking, which are the ideas of all the animals which ever have been or ever will be eating and drinking in this world. Yet Mosheim candidly acknowledges, that if the controversy were to be decided by the votes of the learned, he is doubtful whether it would be given for or against him; and Cudworth, though he pleads\nPlatonism pleads the cause of his master with much ingenuity, owns, that on this subject his language cannot be vindicated. This indeed is most true; for Plato contends, that his ideas are not only the objects of science, but also the proper or physical causes of all things here below; that the idea of similitude is the cause of the resemblance between two globes; and the idea of dissimilitude the cause that a globe does not resemble a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>: he likewise calls them ovus, efences or fulfiances, and many of his followers have pronounced them to be animals.\n\nThese wonderful expressions incline us to adopt with some hesitation the opinion stated by Dr Enfield. This historian of philosophy having observed, that some of the admirers of Plato contend, that by ideas existing in the reason of God, nothing more is meant than conceptions formed in the Divine mind, controverts this opinion with much effect. \"By ideas, Plato (says he) appears to have meant something much more mysterious; namely, patterns or archetypes subsisting by themselves, as real beings, ovus ola in the Divine reason, as in their original and eternal region, and issuing thence to give form to sensible things, and to become objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> and science to rational beings. It is the doctrine of the Timaeus, that \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6, the reason of God, comprehends exemplars of all things, and that this reason is one of the primary causes of things. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a> says, that Plato supposes three principles, God, Matter, and Idea. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-JUSTIN_MARTYR\">Justin <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PSEUDO\">Pseudo</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>, and others, affirm the same thing.\n\n\"That this is the true Platonic doctrine of ideas will appear probable, if we attend to the manner in which Plato framed his system of opinions concerning the origin of things. Having been from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> (says Aristotle) conversant with Cratylus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERACLITUS\">Heraclitus</a>, and instructed in the doctrine of that school, that all sensible things are variable, and cannot be proper objects of science, he reasonably concluded, that if there be any such thing as science, there must exist, besides sensible objects, certain permanent natures, perceptible only by the intellect.\" Such natures, divine in their origin, and eternal and immutable in their existence, he admitted into his system, and called them ideas. Visible things were regarded by Plato as fleeting shades, and ideas as the only permanent substances. These he conceived to be the proper objects of science to a mind raised by divine contemplation above the perpetually varying scenes of the material world.\"\n\nIt was a fundamental doctrine in the system of Plato, that the Deity formed the material world after a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, consisting of those ideas which had eternally subsisted in his own reason; and yet, with some appearance of contradiction, he calls this model \"self-existent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVISIBLE\">indivisible</a>, and eternally generated.\" Nay, he talks of it as being intelligent as well as eternal, and wholly different from the transcripts, which are subjected to our inspection. There is so much mystery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> absurdity, in the whole of this system, as it has come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to us, that we must suppose the friends of Plato to have been entrusted with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to his esoteric doctrines, which has long been lost, otherwise it would be difficult to conceive how that philosopher could have had so many admirers.\n\nWith almost every ancient theist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> the founder of the academy believed in an order of beings called daemons, which were superior to the souls of men, and Plato struck off by the Demiurge from the foul of the world.\n\nOf these the reader will find some account elsewhere: (See Daemon and Polytheism). We mention them at present because they make an important appearance in Plato's system of physics, which was built upon them and upon the doctrine which has been stated concerning God, matter, and ideas. He taught, that the visible world was formed by the Supreme Architect, uniting eternal and immutable ideas to the first matter; that the universe is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> being *, including within its limits all animated natures; that, in the formation of the visible and tangible world, fire and earth were first formed, and were afterwards united by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; that from perfect parts one perfect whole was produced, of a spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, as most beautiful in itself, and best fitted to contain all other figures \u2020; that the elementary parts of the world are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> geometrical forms, the particles of earth being cubical, those of fire pyramidal, those of air in the form of an octahedron, and those of water in that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICOSAHEDRON\">icosahedron</a>; that these are adjusted in number, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, and power, in perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the geometrical laws of proportion; that the soul which pervades this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> is the cause of its revolution round its centre; and, lastly, that the world will remain for ever, but that by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of its animating principle, it accomplishes certain periods, within which every thing returns to its ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and state. This periodical revolution of nature is called the Platonic or great year. See the preceding article.\n\nThe metaphysical doctrines of Plato, which treat of the human soul, and the principles of his system of ethics, have been detailed in other articles (See Metaphysics, Part III. chap. iv.; and Moral Philosophy, No. 6.); but it is worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> in this place, that, preparatory to the study of all philosophy, he required from his disciples a knowledge of the elements of mathematics. In his Republic, he makes Glaucus, one of the speakers, recommend them for their usefulness in human life. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a> for accounts and distributions; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> for encampments and mensurations; music for solemn festivals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the gods; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, and the like. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, on his part, denies not the truth of all this, but still intimates that they were capable of answering an end more sublime. \"You are pleasant (says he) in your seeming to fear the multitude, lest you should be thought to enjoin certain sciences that are useless. 'Tis indeed no contemptible matter, though a difficult one, to believe, that through these particular sciences the soul has an organ purified and enlightened, which is destroyed and blinded by studies of other kinds; an organ better worth saving than a thousand eyes, in as much as truth becomes visible through this alone.\"\n\nConcerning policy, Plato has written at large in his Republic and in his Dialogue on Laws. He was so much enamoured with his own conceptions on this subject, that it was chiefly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of having an opportunity to realise his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of a republic which induced him to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Dionysius. But they who are conversant with mankind, and capable of calmly investigating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of human actions, will easily perceive that his projects were chimerical, and could only have originated in a mind replete with philosophical enthusiasm. Of this nothing can be a clearer proof than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of admitting:\nPlatonism ting in his republic a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of women, in order to give reason an entire control over desire. The main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> institutions appears to have been, the subjugation of the passions and appetites, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> contemplation of ideas. A system of policy, raised upon such fanciful grounds, cannot merit a more distinct consideration.\n\nSuch is genuine Platonism as it was taught in the old academy by the founder of the school and his immediate followers; but when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCESILAUS\">Arcesilaus</a> was placed at the head of the academics, great innovations were introduced both into their doctrines and into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of teaching (see Arcesilaus). This man was therefore considered as the founder of what was afterwards called the middle academy. Being a professed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCEPTIC\">sceptic</a>, he carried his maxim of uncertainty to such a height, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> the general body of philosophers, offend the governors of the state, and bring just odium upon the very name of the academy. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARNEADES\">Carneades</a>, one of the disciples of this school, relinquishing some of the more obnoxious tenets of Arcesilaus, founded what has been called the new academy with very little improvement on the principles of the middle. See Carneades.\n\nUnder one or other of these forms Platonism found its way into the Roman republic. Cicero was a Platonist, and one of the greatest ornaments of the school. A school of Platonists was likewise founded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> in the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> of the Christian era; but their doctrines differed in many particulars from those taught in the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a>. They professed to seek truth wherever they could find it, and to collect their dogmas from every school. They endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> some of the principles of Plato into a conformity with the doctrines of the gospel; and they incorporated with the whole many of the maxims of Aristotle and Zeno, and not a few of the fictions of the east. Their system was therefore extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a>, and seldom so rational as that of the philosopher after whose name they were called, and of whose doctrines we have given so copious a detail. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIUS\">Ammonius</a>, Eclectics, and Plotinus.","sp":255,"ep":260},{"h":"PLAUTUS","t":"Marcus Accius, a comic writer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome, born in Umbria, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. His proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> was Marcus Accius, and he is supposed to have acquired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of Plautus from having play feet. His parentage appears to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>; so that some have thought he was the son of a slave. Aulus Gellius says that Plautus was distinguished for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, and Cato for his eloquence in the forum, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; and observes elsewhere from Varro, that he was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> paid for his plays as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> his stock in trading, in which he lost all he gained by the mules. He is said to have been reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> at a mill for his subsistence; but Varro adds, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> was his best support, as he composed three of his plays during this drudgery. He died in the first year of the elder Cato's censorship, about the year of Rome 369, and 184 before Christ. We have 20 of his plays extant, though not all of them entire. Five of them, comedies, have been elegantly translated into English by Mr B. Thornton, and published in 2 vols 8vo, 1767.\n\nPLAYS. See the following article.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">PLAYHOUSE</a>. See Theatre, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">Amphitheatre</a>, &c. The most ancient English playhouses were the Curtain in Shoreditch and the Theatre. In the time of Playhouse, Shakespeare, who commenced a dramatic writer in 1592, there were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRES\">theatres</a> open. Four of these were private houses, viz. that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACKFRIARS\">Blackfriars</a>, the Cockpit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Phoenix in Drury-Lane, a theatre in Whitefriars, and one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. The other six were called public theatres, viz. the Globe, the Swan, the Rose, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">Bank</a>-side; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Bull, at the upper end of St John's street, and the Fortune in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> street. The two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> were chiefly frequented by citizens. Mr Malone gives us a pretty copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of these playhouses, in a supplement to his last edition of Shakespeare, which we shall here insert.\n\n\"Most, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not all (says he) of Shakespeare's plays were performed either at the Globe or at the Theatre in Blackfriars. It appears that they both belonged to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of comedians, viz. his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>'s servants, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> they assumed, after a licence had been granted to them by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> James in 1603, having before that time been called the servants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> chamberlain.\n\n\"The theatre in Blackfriars was a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; but the peculiar and distinguishing marks of a private playhouse it is not easy to ascertain. It was very small, and plays were there usually represented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. The Globe, situated on the southern side of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, was a hexagonal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, partly open to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, partly covered with reeds. It was a public theatre, and of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, and there they always acted by daylight. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the Globe, and the other public theatres, a pole was erected, to which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> was affixed. These flags were probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> only during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>; and it should seem from a passage in one of the old comedies that they were taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a>, in which season no plays were presented. The Globe, though hexagonal at the outside, was probably a rotunda within, and perhaps had its name from its circular form. It might, however, have been denominated only from its sign, which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> supporting the Globe. This theatre was burnt down in 1613, but it was rebuilt in the following year, and decorated with more ornament than had been originally bestowed upon it. The exhibitions at the Globe seem to have been calculated chiefly for the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of people; those at Blackfriars for a more select and judicious audience.\n\n\"A writer informs us, that one of these theatres was a winter and the other a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> house. As the Globe was partly exposed to the weather, and they acted there usually by daylight, it was probably the summer theatre. The exhibitions here seem to have been more frequent than at Blackfriars, at least till the year 1604 or 1605, when the Bank-side appears to have become less fashionable and less frequented than it formerly had been. Many of our ancient dramatic pieces were performed in the yards of carriers' inns; in which, in the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>'s reign, the comedians, who then first united themselves in companies, erected an occasional stage. The form of these temporary playhouses seems to be preserved in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> theatre. The galleries are in both ranged over each other on three sides of the building. The small rooms under the lowest of these galleries answer to our present boxes; and it is observable that these, even in theatres which were\nwere built in a subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> expressly for dramatic exhibitions, still retained their old name, and are frequently called rooms by our ancient writers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> bears a sufficient resemblance to the pit, as at present in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. We may suppose the stage to have been raised in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, on the fourth side, with its back to the gateway of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">inn</a>, at which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> for admission was taken. Hence, in the middle of the Globe, and I suppose of the other public theatres, in the time of Shakespeare, there was an open yard or area, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people stood to see the exhibition; from which circumstance they are called by our author groundlings, and by Ben Jonson \"the understanding gentlemen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>.\"\n\n\"In the ancient playhouses there appears to have been a private box, of which it is not easy to ascertain the situation. It seems to have been placed at the side of the stage towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a>, and to have been at a lower price: in this some people sat, either from economy or singularity. The galleries, or scaffolds as they are sometimes called, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the house which in private theatres was named the pit, seem to have been at the same price; and probably in houses of reputation, such as the Globe, and that in Blackfriars, the price of admission into those parts of the theatre was 6d. while in some meaner playhouses it was only 1d. in others only 2d. The price of admission into the best rooms or boxes was, I believe, in our author's time, 1s.; though afterwards it appears to have risen to 2s. and half-a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>.\n\n\"From several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in our old plays, we learn, that spectators were admitted on the stage, and that the critics and wits of the time usually sat there. Some were placed on the ground; others sat on stools, of which the price was either 6d. or 1s. according; I suppose, to the commodiousness of the situation; and they were attended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, who furnished them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, which was smoked here as well as in other parts of the house: yet it should seem that persons were suffered to sit on the stage only in the private playhouses, such as Blackfriars, &c., where the audience was more select, and of a higher class; and that in the Globe and other public theatres no such licence was permitted.\n\n\"The stage was firewood with rushes, which, as we learn from Hentzner and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> de Ephemeris, was, in the time of Shakespeare, the usual covering of floors in England. The curtain which hangs in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the present stage, drawn up by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> and pulleys, though not a modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, for it was used by Inigo Jones in the masques at court, was yet an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> to which the simple mechanism of our ancient theatres had not arrived, for in them the curtains opened in the middle, and were drawn backwards and forwards on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> rod. In some playhouses they were woollen, in others made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>.\u2014Towards the rear of the stage there appears to have been a balcony, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> of which was probably eight or ten feet from the ground. I suppose it to have been supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>. From hence, in many of our old plays, part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> was spoken; and in the front of this balcony curtains likewise were hung.\n\n\"A doubt has been entertained whether in our ancient theatres there were fide and other scenes. The question is involved in so much obscurity, that it is very difficult to form any decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> upon it. It is certain, that in the year 1693 Inigo Jones exhibited an entertainment at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> scenes were used; but he appears to have introduced several pieces of machinery in the masques at court, with which undoubtedly the public theatres were unacquainted. A passage which has been produced from one of the old comedies, proves, it must be owned, that even these were furnished with some pieces of machinery, which were used when it was requisite to exhibit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of some god or saint; but from all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> accounts, I am inclined to believe that the mechanism of our ancient stage seldom went beyond a painted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> or a trap-door, and that few, if any of them, had any moveable scenes. When King Henry VIII. is to be discovered by the dukes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, the scenerical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in the first folio, 1623, which was printed apparently from playhouse copies, is, 'the king draws the curtain, (i.e. draws it open), and sits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> pensively;' for, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> curtains that hung in the front of the stage, they used others as substitutes for scenes. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-chamber is to be exhibited, no change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> is mentioned; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is simply ordered to thrust forth a bed. When the tale requires the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPITOL\">capitol</a> to be exhibited, we find two officers enter, 'to lay cushions, as it were, in the capitol,' &c. On the whole, it appears, that our ancient theatres, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, were only furnished with curtains, and a single scene composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPESTRY\">tapestry</a>, which were sometimes, perhaps, ornamented with pictures; and some passages in our old dramas incline one to think, that when tragedies were performed the stage was hung with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>.\n\n\"In the early part, at least, of our author's acquaintance with the theatre, the want of scenery seems to have been supplied by the simple expedient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the names of the different places where the scene was laid in the progress of the play, which were dispensed in such a manner as to be visible to the audience. The invention of trap-doors, however, appears not to be modern; for in an old morality, intitled All for Money, we find a marginal direction which implies that they were very early in use. The covering, or internal roof of the stage, was anciently termed the heavens. It was probably painted of a sky-blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, or perhaps pieces of drapery tinged with blue were suspended across the stage to represent the heavens.\n\n\"It is probable that the stage was formerly lighted by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> branches, of a form similar to those now hung in churches. They gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in a subsequent period to small circular wooden frames, furnished with candles, eight of which were hung on the stage, four at either side, and these within a few years were wholly removed by Mr Garrick, who, on his return from France, first introduced the present commodious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of illuminating the stage by lights not visible to the audience. Many of the companies of players were formerly so thin, that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> played two or three parts; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> on which the fate of an empire was supposed to depend was decided by half a dozen combatants. It appears to have been a common practice in their mock engagements to discharge small pieces of ordnance on the stage. Before the exhibition began, three flourishes or pieces of music were played, or, in the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, there were three soundings. Music was likewise played between the acts. The instruments chiefly used were trumpets, cornets, and hautboys.\"\nThe hautboys. The band, which did not consist of more than five or six performers, sat in an upper balcony, over what is now called the stage-box.\n\n\"The person who spoke the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROLOGUE\">prologue</a> was ushered in by trumpets, and usually wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a> cloak, which, I suppose, was considered as best suited to a supplicatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>. Of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, whatever might have been its origin, some traces remained till very lately, a black coat having been, if I mistake not, within these few years, the constant stage-habiment of our modern prologue-speakers. The dress of the ancient prologue-speaker is still retained in the play that is exhibited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMLET\">Hamlet</a> before the king and court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>. The performers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> generally wore periwigs, which in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of Shakespeare were not in common use. It appears, from a passage in Puttenham's *Art of English Poetry*, 1589, that wigs were worn on some occasions used by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTORS\">actors</a> of those days; and it may be inferred, from a scene in one of our author's comedies, that they were sometimes worn in his time by those who performed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> characters; but this I imagine was very rare. Some of the female part of the audience likewise appeared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASKS\">masks</a>. The stage-dresses, it is reasonable to suppose, were much more costly at some theatres than at others; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDROBE\">wardrobe</a> of even the king's servants at the Globe and Blackfriars, was, we find, but scantily furnished; and our author's dramas derived very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> from the splendor of exhibition.\n\n\"It is well known, that in the time of Shakespeare, and for many years afterwards, female characters were represented by boys or young men. Sir William d'Avenant, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the foreign theatres, first introduced females in the scene, and Mrs Betterton is said to have been the first woman that appeared on the English stage. Andrew Pennyquick played the part of Matilda in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> of Davenport's, in 1655; and Mr Kynaston acted several female parts after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>. Downes, a contemporary of his, affirms us, 'that being then very young he made a complete stage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, performing his parts so well, particularly Arthiope and Aglaura, that it has since been disputable among the judicious whether any woman that succeeded him touched the audience so sensibly as he.'\n\n\"Both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMPTER\">prompter</a>, or book-holder, as he was sometimes called, and the property-man, appear to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> appendages of our ancient theatres. No writer that I have met with intimates, that in the time of Shakespeare it was customary to exhibit more than a single dramatic piece on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> tragedy, or *All's One*, indeed, appears to have been one of four pieces that were represented on the same day; and Fletcher has also a piece called *Four Plays in One*; but probably these were either exhibited on some particular occasion, or were ineffectual efforts to introduce a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of amusement; for we do not find any other instances of the same kind. Had any shorter pieces been exhibited after the principal performance, some of them probably would have been printed: but there are none extant of an earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> than the time of the Restoration. The practice, therefore, of exhibiting two dramas successively in the same evening, we may be assured was not established before that period. But though the audiences in the time of our author were not gratified by the representation of more than one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAMA\">drama</a> in the same day, the entertainment was diversified, and the populace diverted, by vaulting, tumbling, flight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and morris-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> not much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> than that with which we are daily presented, a tragedy and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a>.\n\n\"The amusements of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, before the commencement of the play, were of various kinds, such as reading, playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, drinking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALE\">ale</a>, or smoking tobacco. It was a common practice to carry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>-books to the theatre, and either from curiosity or enmity to the author, or some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a>, to write down passages of the play that was represented: and there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> and mutilated copies of some of Shakespeare's dramas, which are yet extant, were taken down in short-hand during the exhibition. At the end of the piece, the actors, in noblemen's houses and in taverns, where plays were frequently performed, prayed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and prosperity of their patrons; and in the public theatres for the king and queen. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> sometimes made part of the epilogue. Hence, probably, as Mr Steevens has observed, the addition of *Vivat rex et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-REGINA\">regina</a>* to the modern play-bills.\n\n\"Plays, in the time of our author, began at one o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>; and the exhibition was usually finished in two hours. Even in 1667 they commenced at three. When Goffon wrote his *School of Abuse*, in 1579, it seems the dramatic entertainments were usually exhibited on Sundays. Afterwards they were performed on that and other days indiscriminately. It appears from a contemporary writer, that exhibiting plays on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> had not been abolished in the third year of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I.\n\n\"The modes of conveyance to the theatre, anciently as at present, seem to have been various; some going in coaches, others on horseback, and many by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\u2014To the Globe playhouse the company probably were conveyed by water; to that in Blackfriars the gentry went either in coaches or on horseback, and the common people on foot. In an epigram to Sir John Davis, the practice of riding to the theatre is ridiculed as a piece of affectation or vanity, and therefore we may presume it was not very general.\n\n\"The long and whimsical titles that are prefixed to the quarto copies of our author's plays, I suppose to have been transcribed from the play-bills of the time. A contemporary writer has preserved something like a play-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of those days, which seems to corroborate this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; for if it were deprived of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a>, it would bear no very distant resemblance to the title pages that stand before some of our author's dramas:\n\n\"Prithee, what's the play?\n(The first I visited this twelvemonth day)\nThey say \"A new invented play of Purle,\nThat jeoparded his neck to steal a girl\nOf twelve; and lying fast impounded for't,\nHas hither sent his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> his part;\nAgainst all those in open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> bent,\nThat would not freely to the thief consent:\nFeigns all to's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and in the epilogue\nGoes out applauded for a famous rogue.\"\n\u2014Now hang me if I did not look at first\nFor some such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, by the fond people's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>.\"\n\n\"It is uncertain at what time the usage of giving authors a benefit on the third day of the exhibition of their pieces commenced. Mr Oldys, in one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>, intimates that dramatic poets had anciently their benefit on the first day that a new play was represented; a regulation...\"\nPlayhouse which would have been very favourable to some of the ephemeral productions of modern times. But for this there is not, I believe, any sufficient authority. From D'Avenant, indeed, we learn, that in the latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the poet had his benefit on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> day. As it was a general practice in the time of Shakespeare to sell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the play to the theatre, I imagine in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> an author derived no other advantage from his piece than what arose from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of it. Sometimes, however, he found it more beneficial to retain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPYRIGHT\">copyright</a> in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and when he did so, I suppose he had a benefit. It is certain that the giving authors the profit of the third exhibition of their play, which seems to have been the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> during almost the whole of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, was an established custom in the year 1612, for Dekker, in the prologue to one of his comedies printed in that year, speaks of the poet's third day. The unfortunate Olway had no more than one benefit on the production of a new play; and this too, it seems, he was sometimes forced to mortgage before the piece was acted. Southerne was the first dramatic writer who obtained the emoluments arising from two representations; and to Farquhar, in the year 1703, the benefit of a third was granted. When an author sold his piece to the sharers or proprietors of a theatre, it remained for several years unpublished; but when that was not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, he printed it for sale, to which many seem to have been induced, from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> that an imperfect copy might be issued from the press without their consent. The customary price of the copy of a play in the time of Shakespeare appears to have been twenty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, or five pounds thirteen shillings and four pence. The play when printed was sold for sixpence; and the usual present from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> in return for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> was forty shillings. On the first day of exhibiting a new play, the prices of admission appear to have been raised; and this seems to have been occasionally practised on the benefit-nights of authors to the end of the last century. The custom of affording a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> censure on plays at their first exhibition is as ancient as the time of our author; for no less than three plays of his rival Ben Jonson appear to have been damned; and Fletcher's Faithful Shepherdess, and The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">Burning</a> Pestle, written by him and Beaumont, underwent the same fate.\n\n\"It is not easy to ascertain what were the emoluments of a successful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> in the time of Shakespeare. They had not then annual benefits as at present. The performers at each theatre seem to have shared the profits arising either from each day's exhibition or from the whole season among them.\" From Ben Jonson's Poetaster we learn, that one of either the performers or proprietors had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> shares and a half; but of what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEGRAL\">integral</a> sum is not mentioned. From the prices of admission into our ancient theatres, which have been already mentioned, I imagine the utmost that the sharers of the Globe playhouse could have received on any one day was about \u00a35. So lately as the year 1685, Shadwell received by his third day on the representation of the Squire of Alsatia, \u00a3130.; which Downes the prompter says was the greatest receipt that had ever been taken at Drury-Lane playhouse at single prices. It appears from the MSS. of Lord Stanhope, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the chambers to King James I., that the customary sum paid to John Heminge and his company for the performance of a play at court was twenty nobles, or five pounds thirteen shillings and four pence. And Edward Alleyn mentions in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIARY\">Diary</a>, that he once had so slender an audience in his theatre called the Fortune, that the whole receipts of the house amounted to no more than three pounds and some odd shillings.\n\n\"Thus scanty and meagre were the apparatus and accommodations of our ancient theatres, on which those dramas were first exhibited, that have since engaged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of so many learned men, and delighted to many thousand spectators. Yet even then, we are told by a writer of that age, 'that dramatic poetry was so lively expressed and represented on the public stages and theatres of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, as Rome in the age of her pomp and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it better performed; in respect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and art, not of the coit and sumptuousness.'\"","sp":260,"ep":263},{"h":"PLAYERS","t":"in fortification, denote a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> used in raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> letting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a draw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>.

See ARRRAIGNMENT.\n\nCommon pleas are such suits as are carried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> between common persons in civil causes. These pleas are of two sorts; dilatory pleas, and pleas to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. Dilatory pleas are such as tend merely to delay or put off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, by questioning the propriety of the remedy, rather than by denying the injury; pleas to the action are such as dispute the very cause of suit.\n\n1. Dilatory pleas are,\n\n1. To the jurisdiction of the court: alleging, that it ought not to hold plea of this injury, it arising in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> or beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>: or because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in question is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> demesne, and ought only to be demanded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>'s court, &c.\n\n2. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a> of the plaintiff, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> whereof he is incapable to commence or continue the suit; as, that he is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALIEN\">alien</a> enemy, outlawed, excommunicated, attainted of treason or felony, under a praemunire, not in rerum natura (being only a fictitious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>), an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>, a feme-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a>, or a monk professed.\n\n3. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABATEMENT\">abatement</a>: which abatement is either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a>, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a>, for some defect in one of them; as by misnaming the defendant, which is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISNOMER\">misnomer</a>; giving him a wrong addition, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ESQUIRE\">esquire</a> instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>; or other want of form in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> respect. Or, it may be that the plaintiff is dead; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of either party is at once an abatement of the suit.\n\nThese pleas to the jurisdiction, to the disability, or in abatement, were formerly very often used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> dilatory pleas, without any foundation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and calculated only for delay; but now by flat. 4 & 5 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. c. 16, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> dilatory plea is to be admitted without affidavit made of the truth thereof, or some probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> thrown to the court to induce them to believe it true. And with respect to the pleas themselves, it is a rule, that no exception shall be admitted against a declaration or writ, unless the defendant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> in the same plea give the plaintiff a better; that is, show him how it might be amended, that there may not be two objections upon the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>.\nAll pleas to the jurisdiction conclude to the cognizance of the court; praying \"judgement whether the court will have farther cognizance of the suit.\" Pleas to the disability conclude to the person; by praying \"judgement, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the said A the plaintiff ought to be answered.\" And pleas in abatement (when the suit is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>) conclude to the writ, or declaration; by praying \"judgement of the writ, or declaration, and that the same may be quashed,\" estteur, made void, or abated: but if the action be by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>, the plea must pray \"judgement of the bill,\" and not of the declaration; the bill being here the original, and the declaration only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the bill.\n\nWhen these dilatory pleas are allowed, the cause is either dismissed from that jurisdiction, or the plaintiff is stayed till his disability be removed; or he is obliged to sue out a new writ, by leave obtained from the court, or to amend and new-frame his declaration. But when, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, they are overruled as frivolous, the defendant has judgement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESPONDENT\">respondent</a> ouster, or to answer over in some better manner. It is then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on him to plead.\n\n2. A plea to the action; that is, to answer to the merits of the complaint. This is done by confessing or denying it.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a> of the whole complaint is not very usual; for then the defendant would probably end the matter sooner, or not plead at all, but suffer judgement to go by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFAULT\">default</a>. Yet sometimes, after tender and refusal of a debt, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDITOR\">creditor</a> harasses his debtor with an action, it then becomes necessary for the defendant to acknowledge the debt, and plead the tender; adding, that he has always been ready, tout temps prif, and is still ready, uncore prif, to discharge it: for a tender by the debtor and refusal by the creditor will in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> discharge the costs, but not the debt itself; though in some particular cases the creditor will totally lose his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. But frequently the defendant confesses one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the complaint (by a cognovit actionem in respect thereof), and traverses or denies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>; in order to avoid the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> that part to a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, which he has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> to litigate. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of this sort of confession is the payment of money into court: which is for the most part necessary upon pleading a tender, and is itself a kind of tender to the plaintiff; by paying into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the proper officer of the court as much as the defendant acknowledges to be due, together with the costs hitherto incurred, in order to prevent the expense of any farther proceedings. This may be done upon what is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; which is an occasional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the court by the parties or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a>, in order to obtain some rule or order of court, which becomes necessary in the progress of a cause: and it is usually grounded upon an affidavit (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> tense of the verb affido), being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> oath before some judge or officer of the court, to convince the truth of certain facts, upon which the motion is grounded: though no such affidavit is necessary for payment of money into court. If, after the money is paid in, the plaintiff proceeds in his suit, it is at his own peril: for if he does not prove more due than is so paid into court, he shall be nonsuited and pay the defendant's costs; but he shall still have the money so paid in, for that the defendant has acknowledged to be his due. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> may also be referred the practice of what is called a fet off; whereby the defendant acknowledges the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the plaintiff's demand on the one hand; but on the other, sets up a demand of his own, to counterbalance that of the plaintiff, either in the whole or in part; as, if the plaintiff sues for ten pounds due on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of hand, the defendant may set off <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pounds due to himself for merchandise sold to the plaintiff; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> he plead such fet-off, must pay the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> into court.\n\nPleas that totally deny the cause of complaint are either the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, or a special plea in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>.\n\n1. The general issue, or general plea, is what traverses, thwarts, and denies at once, the whole declaration, without offering any special matter whereby to evade it. As in trespas either vi et armis, or on the case, \"non culpabilis, not guilty?\" in debt upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>, \"nihil debet, he owes nothing;\" in debt on bond, non est factum, it is not his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>;\" on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPSIT\">assumpsit</a>, \"non assumpsit, he made no such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>.\" Or in real actions, \"nul tort, no wrong done; nul dillefin, no dillefin;\" and in a writ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> or issue is, that \"the tenant has more right to hold than the demandant has to demand.\" These pleas are called the general issue, because, by importing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and general denial of what is alleged in the declaration, they amount at once to an issue; by which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> a fact affirmed on one side and denied on the other.\n\n2. Special pleas in bar of the plaintiff's demands are very various, according to the circumstances of the defendant's case. As, in real actions, a general release or a fine; both of which may destroy and bar the plaintiff's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. Or, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> actions, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, arbitration, conditions performed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONAGE\">nonage</a> of the defendant, or some other fact which precludes the plaintiff from his action. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> is likewise a special plea in bar; as in actions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAULT\">assault</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, non assault dementhe, that it was the plaintiff's own original assault; in trespasses, that the defendant did the thing complained of in right of some office which warranted him so to do; or, in an action of slander, that the plaintiff is really as bad a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> as the defendant said he was.\n\nAlso a man may plead the statutes of limitation in bar; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> limited by certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ACTS_OF_PARLIAMENT\">acts of <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, beyond which no plaintiff can lay his cause of action. This, by the statute of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 2, in a writ of right is 60 years: in alizes, writs of entry, or other possessory actions real, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEISIN\">seisin</a> of one's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> in lands; and either of their seisin, or one's own, in rents, suits, and services, 50 years: and in actions real for lands grounded upon one's own seisin or possession, such possession must have been within 30 years. By statute 1 Mar. st. 2, c. 5, this limitation does not extend to any suit for avowons. But by the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 2, a time of limitation was extended to the case of the king; viz. 60 years precedent to 19th Feb. 1623; but, this becoming ineffectual by efflux of time, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of limitation was fixed by statute 9 Geo. III. c. 16, to commence and be reckoned backwards, from the time of bringing any suit or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> to recover the thing in question; so that a possession for 60 years is now a bar even against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEROGATION\">derogation</a> of the ancient maxim, Nullum tempus occurrit regi. By another statute, 21 Jac. I. c. 16, 20 years is the time of limitation in any writ of formondem: and, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, 20 years is also the limitation in every action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EJECTMENT\">ejectment</a>; for no ejectment can be brought, unless where\nwhere the lessor of the plaintiff is entitled to enter on the lands, and by the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 16. no entry can be made by any man, unless within 20 years after his right shall accrue. Also all actions of trespass (quare clausum fregit, or otherwise), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETINUE\">detinue</a>, trover, replevin, account, and case (except upon accounts between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>), debt on simple contract, or for arrears of rent, are limited by the statute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> mentioned to five years after the cause of action commenced; and actions of assault, menace, battery, mayhem, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>, must be brought within four years, and actions for words two years, after the injury committed. And by the statute 31 Eliz. c. 5. all suits, indictments, and informations, upon any penal statutes, where any forfeiture is to the crown, shall be sued within two years, and where the forfeiture is to a subject, within one year, after the offence committed, unless where any other time is specially limited by the statute. Lastly, by statute 10 W. III. c. 14. no writ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, feire facias, or other suit, shall be brought to reverse any judgment, fine, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, for error, unless it be prosecuted within 20 years. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of these statutes of limitation is to preserve the peace of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, and to prevent those innumerable perjuries which might ensue if a man were allowed to bring an action for any injury committed at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of time. Upon both these accounts the law therefore holds, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> reipublicae ut fit finis illium: and upon the same principle the Athenian laws in general prohibited all actions where the injury was committed five years before the complaint was made. If therefore, in any suit, the injury, or cause of action, happened earlier than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> expressly limited by law, the defendant may plead the statutes of limitations in bar: as upon an affumpst, or promise to pay money to the plaintiff, the defendant may plead, Non affumpst infra <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> annos, He made no such promise within five years; which is an effectual bar to the complaint.\n\nAn etoppel is likewise a special plea in bar; which happens where a man hath done some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, or executed some deed, which etops or precludes him from averring any thing to the contrary. As if a tenant for years (who hath no freehold) levies a fine to another person. Though this is void as to strangers, yet it shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> as an etoppel to the cognizance; for, if he afterwards brings an action to recover these lands, and his fine is pleaded against him, he shall thereby be etopped from saying, that he had no freehold at the time, and therefore was incapable of levying it.\n\nThe conditions and qualities of a plea (which, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the doctrine of ettoppels, will also hold equally, mutatis mutandis, with regard to other parts of pleading), are, 1. That it be single and containing only one matter; for duplicity begets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. But by statute 4 and 5 Ann. c. 16. a man, with leave of the court, may plead two or more distinct matters or single pleas; as in an action of assault and battery, these three, Not guilty, sin assault demesne, and the statute of limitations. 2. That it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and positive, and not argumentative. 3. That it have convenient certainty of time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and persons. 4. That it answer the plaintiff's allegations in every material point. 5. That it be so pleaded as to be capable of trial.\n\nSpecial pleas are usually in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>, sometimes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, but they always advance some new fact not mentioned in the declaration; and then they must be averred to be true in the common form:\u2014\u201cAnd this he is ready to verify.\u201d\u2014This is not necessary in pleas of the general issue, those always containing a total denial of the facts before advanced by the other party, and therefore putting him upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of them. See PLEADINGS.\n\nPLEA to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">Indictment</a>, the defensive matter alleged by a Blackfriar criminal on his indictment; (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARRAIGNMENT\">ARRAIGNMENT</a>.) This Comment is either, 1. A plea to the jurisdiction; 2. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMURRER\">demurrer</a>; 3. A plea in abatement; 4. A special plea in bar; or, 5. The general issue.\n\nI. A plea to the jurisdiction, is where an indictment is taken before a court that hath no cognizance of the offence; as if a man be indicted for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>, or for treason at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>-sessions: in these or similar cases, he may except to the jurisdiction of the court, without answering at all to the crime alleged.\n\nII. A demurrer to the indictment, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> to criminal cases, as well as civil, when the fact as alleged is allowed to be true, but the prisoner joins issue upon some point of law in the indictment, by which he infers, that the fact, as stated, is no felony, treason, or whatever the crime is alleged to be. Thus, for instance, if a man be indicted for feloniously stealing a greyhound; which is an animal in which no valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> can be had, and therefore it is not felony, but only a civil trespass to steal it; in this case the party indicted may demur to the indictment; denying it to be felony, though he confesses the act of taking it. Some have held, that if, on demurrer, the point of law be adjudged against the prisoner, he shall have judgement and execution, as if convicted by verdict. But this is denied by others, who hold, that in such case he shall be directed and received to plead the general issue, Not guilty, after a demurrer determined against him. Which appears the more reasonable, because it is clear, that if the prisoner freely discovers the fact in court, and refers it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the court whether it be felony or not; and upon the fact thus shown, it appears to be felony, the court will not record the confession, but admit him afterwards to plead not guilty. And this seems to be a case of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, being for the most part a mistake in point of law, and in the conduct of his pleading; and, though a man by mispleading may in some cases lose his property, yet the law will not suffer him by such niceties to lose his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. However, upon this doubt, demurrers to indictments are seldom used; since the same advantages may be taken upon a plea of not guilty; or afterwards, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> of judgement, when the verdict has established the fact.\n\nIII. A plea in abatement is principally for a misnomer, a wrong name, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> addition to the prisoner. As, if James Allen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, is indicted by the name of John Allen, esquire, he may plead that he has the name of James, and not of John; and that he is a gentleman, and not an esquire. And, if either fact is found by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>, then the indictment shall be abated, as writs or declarations may be in civil actions. But, in the end, there is little advantage accruing to the prisoner by means of these dilatory pleas; because, if the exception be allowed, a new bill of indictment may be framed, according to what the prisoner in his plea avers to be his true name and addition. For it is a rule, upon all pleas in abatement, that he who takes advantage of a flaw,\nmust at the same time show how it may be amended.\n\nLet us therefore next consider a more substantial kind of plea, viz.\n\nIV. Special pleas in bar; which go to the merits of the indictment, and give a reason why the prisoner ought not to answer it at all, nor put himself upon his trial for the crime alleged. These are of four kinds: a former acquittal, a former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>, a former attainder, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>. There are many other pleas which may be pleaded in bar of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>; but these are applicable to both appeals and indictments.\n\n1. First, the plea of auterfoits acquit, or a former acquittal, is grounded on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life, more than once, for the same offence. And hence it is allowed as a consequence, that when a man is once fairly found not guilty upon any indictment, or other prosecution, before any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence, he may plead such acquittal in bar of any subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> for the same crime.\n\n2. Secondly, the plea of auterfoits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICT\">convict</a>, or a former conviction for the same identical crime, though no judgement was ever given, or perhaps will be (being suspended by the benefit of clergy or other causes), is a good plea in bar to an indictment. And this depends upon the same principle as the former, that no man ought to be twice brought in danger of his life for one and the same crime.\n\n3. Thirdly, the plea of auterfoits attaint, or a former attainder, is a good plea in bar, whether it be for the same or any other felony. For wherever a man is attainted of felony, by judgement of death either upon a verdict or confession, by outlawry, or heresiofore by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABJURATION\">abjuration</a>, and whether upon an appeal or an indictment; he may plead such attainder in bar to any subsequent indictment or appeal, for the same or for any other felony. And this because, generally, such proceeding on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> prosecution cannot be to any purpose; for the prisoner is dead in law by the first attainder, his blood is already corrupted, and he hath forfeited all that he had: so that it is absurd and superfluous to endeavour to attain him a second time. Though to this general rule, as to all others, there are some exceptions; wherein, cestant ratione, estat et ipsa lex.\n\n4. Lastly, a pardon may be pleaded in bar; as at once destroying the end and purpose of the indictment, by remitting that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, which the prosecution is calculated to inflict. There is one advantage that attends pleading a pardon in bar, or in the arrest of judgement before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> is past; which gives it by much the preference to pleading it after sentence or attainder. This is, that by stopping the judgement it stops the attainder, and prevents the corruption of the blood: which, when once corrupted by attainder, cannot afterwards be restored otherwise than by act of parliament.\n\nV. The general issue, or plea of not guilty, upon which plea alone the prisoner can receive his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> judgement of death. In case of an indictment of felony or treason, there can be no special justification put in by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of plea. As, on an indictment for murder, a man cannot plead that it was in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against a robber on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIGHWAY\">highway</a>, or a burglar; but he must plead the general issue, Not guilty, and give this special matter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. For (besides that these pleas do in effect amount to the general issue; since, if true, the prisoner is most clearly not guilty) as the facts in treason are laid to be done proditoriae et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONTRA\">contra</a> ligamentis sine debitione; and, in felony, that the killing was done felonice; these charges, of a traitorous or felonious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a>, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> and very gist of the indictment, and must be answered directly, by the general negative, Not guilty; and the jury upon the evidence will take notice of any defensive matter, and give their verdict accordingly as effectually as if it were or could be specially pleaded. So that this is, upon all accounts, the most advantageous plea for the prisoner.\n\nWhen the prisoner hath thus pleaded not guilty, non culpabilis, or nient culpable: which was formerly used to be abbreviated upon the minutes, thus, Non (or nient) cul, the clerk of the affize, or clerk of arraigns, on behalf of the crown, replies, that the prisoner is guilty, and that he is ready to prove him so. This is done by two monosyllables in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of abbreviation, (cul pri); which signifies first that the prisoner is guilty, (cul culpable, or culpabilis); and then that the king is ready to prove him so, (pri, pretio firm, or paratus, sacrificare). By this replication the king and the prisoner are therefore at issue: for when the parties come to a fact which is affirmed on one side and denied on the other, then they are said to be at issue in point of fact; which is evidently the case here, in the plea of non cul, by the prisoner; and the replication of cul, by the clerk.\n\nHow the courts came to express a matter of this importance in so odd and obscure a manner, can hardly be pronounced with certainty. It may perhaps, however, be accounted for by supposing, that these were at first short notes, to help the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the clerk, and remind him what he was to reply; or else it was the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in court, upon the minutes, the replication and averment; cul pri; which afterwards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of succeeding clerks adopted for the very words to be by them spoken (A).\n\nBut however it may have arisen, the joining of issue seems to be clearly the meaning of this obscure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>; which has puzzled our most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> etymologists, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> understood as if the clerk of the arraigns, immediately on plea pleaded, had fixed an opprobrious name on the prisoner, by asking him, \"culprit, how wilt thou be tried?\" for immediately upon issue joined it is inquired of the prisoner, by what trial he will make his innocence appear.

See the article TRIAL.","sp":263,"ep":267},{"h":"PLEADINGS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> alterations between the plaintiff and defendant, (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">SUIT</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">WRIT</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">PROCESS</a>). They form the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> stage of a fact; and at present are set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and delivered into the proper office in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>; though formerly they were usually put in by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a> ore tenus, or viae voce, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and then minuted down by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> clerks or prothonotaries; whence, in our old law-French, the pleadings are frequently denominated the parol.\n\nThe first of these is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a>, anciently called the tale; in which the plaintiff sets forth his cause of complaint at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>: being indeed only an amplification or exposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> writ upon which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> is founded, with the additional circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, when and where, the injury was committed.\n\nIn local actions, where possession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is to be recovered, or damages for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> trespass, or for waste, &c., affecting land, the plaintiff must lay his declaration, or declare his injury to have happened in the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> and place that it really did happen; but in transitory actions, for injuries that might have happened anywhere, as debt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETINUE\">detinue</a>, flander, and the like, the plaintiff may declare in what county he pleads, and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> must be in that county in which the declaration is laid. Though, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the defendant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> make affidavit that the cause of action, if any, arose not in that but another county, the court will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> a change of the venue or vicinie (that is, the vicinia or neighbourhood in which the injury is declared to be done), and will oblige the plaintiff to declare in the proper county.\n\nFor the statute 6 Ric. II. c. 2. having ordered all writs to be laid in their proper counties, this, as the judges conceived, impowred them to change the venue, if required, and not to insist rigidly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> abating the writ: which practice began in the reign of James I. And this power is discretionally exercised, so as not to cause but prevent a defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. Therefore the court will not change the venue to any of the four northern counties previous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> circuit; because there the assizes are holden only once a-year, at the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> circuit. And it will sometimes remove the venue from the proper jurisdiction (especially of the narrow and limited kind), upon a suggestion, duly supported, that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had therein.\n\nIt is generally usual, in actions upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, to set forth several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, by different counts in the same declaration; so that if the plaintiff fails in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of one, he may succeed in another. As in an action on the case upon an assumptio for goods sold and delivered, the plaintiff usually counts or declares, first, upon a fettered and agreed price between him and the defendant; as, that they bargained for \u00a320.; and left he should fail in the proof of this, he counts likewise upon a quantum valebat; that the defendant bought other goods, and agreed to pay him so much as they were reasonably worth: and then avers that they were worth other \u00a320. and so on in three or four different shapes; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> concludes with declaring, that the defendant had refused to fulfil any of these agreements, whereby he is endangered to lose a value. And if he proves the case laid in any one of his counts, though he fails in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, he shall recover proportionable damages. This declaration always concludes with these words, \"and thereupon he brings suit,\" &c. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> producit seetam, &c.) By which words, suit or seeta (a sequela), were anciently understood the witnesses or followers of the plaintiff. For in former times, the law would not put the defendant to the trouble of answering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> till the plaintiff had made out at least a probable case. But the actual production of the suit, seeta, or follower, is now antiquated, and hath been totally disused, at least ever since the reign of Edward III., though the form of it still continues.\n\nAt the end of the declaration are added also the plaintiff's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> pledges of prosecution, John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a> and Richard Roe; which, as we elsewhere observe, (see WRIT), are now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> names of form; though formerly they were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to answer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> for the arrearsment of the plaintiff, in case he were nonjusticed, barred of his action, or had a verdict and judgment against him. For if the plaintiff neglects to deliver a declaration for two terms after the defendant appears, or is guilty of other delays or defaults against the rules of law in any subsequent stage of the action, he is adjudged not to follow or pursue his remedy as he ought to do; and thereupon a nonjustit, or non prosequitur, is entered, and he is said to be non-press'd. And for thus deferring his complaint, after making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> claim or complaint (pro falso clamore fio), he shall not only pay costs to the defendant, but is liable to be amerced to the king. A retraxit differs from a nonjustit, in that the one is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> and the other positive: the nonjustit is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFAULT\">default</a> and neglect of the plaintiff, and therefore he is allowed to begin his suit again upon payment of costs; but a retraxit is an open and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> renunciation of his suit in court; and by this he for ever loses his action. A discontinueance is somewhat similar to a nonjustit; for when a plaintiff leaves a claim in the proceedings of his cause, as by not-continuing the process regularly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to day, and time to time, as he ought to do, the suit is discontinued, and the defendant is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer bound to attend; but the plaintiff must begin again, by suing out a new original, usually paying costs to his antagonist.\n\nWhen the plaintiff hath stated his case in the declaration, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on the defendant, within a reasonable time, to make his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and put in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a>; or else the plaintiff will at once recover judgment by default, or nihil dicit, of the defendant.\n\nDefence, in its true legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, signifies not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, which is now its popular signification; but merely an opposing or denial (from the French verb defendre) of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or validity of the complaint.\npleadings complaint. It is the *contestation* of the civilians: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> assertion that the plaintiff hath no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of action; which assertion is afterwards extended and maintained in his plea.\n\nBefore defence made, if at all, cognizance of the suit must be claimed or demanded; when any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> or body-corporate hath the franchise, not only of holding pleas within a particular limited jurisdiction, but also of the cognizance of pleas; and that either without any words exclusive of other courts, which intitle the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the franchise, whenever any suit that belongs to his jurisdiction is commenced in the courts at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, to demand the cognizance thereof; or with such exclusive words, which also intitle the defendant to plead to the jurisdiction of the court. Upon this claim of cognizance, if allowed, all proceedings shall cease in the superior court, and the plaintiff is left at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to pursue his remedy in the special jurisdiction. As, when a scholar or other privileged person of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> is impleaded in the courts at Westminster, for any cause of action whatsoever, unless upon a question of freehold. In these cases, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of those learned bodies, confirmed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, or vice-chancellor, may put in a claim of cognizance; which, if made in due time and form, and with due proof of the facts alleged, is regularly allowed by the courts. It must be demanded before full defence is made or appearance prayed; for these are a submission to the jurisdiction of the superior court, and the delay is a *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACHES\">laches</a>* in the lord of the franchise: and it will not be allowed if it occasions a failure of justice, or if an action be brought against the person himself who claims the franchise, unless he hath also a power in such case of making another judge.\n\nAfter defence made, the defendant must put in his plea. But before he defends, if the suit is commenced by *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPIAS\">capias</a>* or *libet*, without any special original, he is intitled to demand one *imparlance*, or *licentia loquendi*; and may, before he pleads, have more granted by consent of the court, to see if he can end the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> amicably without farther suit, by talking with the plaintiff: a practice which is supposed to have arisen from a principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, in obedience to that precept of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>, \"agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> with him.\" And it may be observed, that this gospel-precept has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> reference to the Roman law of the twelve tables, which expressly directed the plaintiff and defendant to make up the matter while they were in the way, or going to the praetor:\u2014*in via, rem uti pacient orato*. There are also many other previous steps which may be taken by a defendant before he puts in his plea. He may, in real actions, demand a view of the thing in question, in order to ascertain its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> and other circumstances. He may crave *quer* of the writ, or of the bond, or other specialty upon which the action is brought; that is, to hear it read to him; the generality of defendants in the times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> simplicity being supposed incapable to read it themselves: whereupon the whole is entered *verbatim* upon the record; and the defendant may take advantage of any condition, or other part of it, not stated in the plaintiff's declaration. In real actions also the tenant may pray in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> for the assistance of another, to help him to plead, because of the feebleness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMBECILITY\">imbecility</a> of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>. Thus a tenant for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> may pray in aid of him that hath the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> in remainder or rever- fission; and an incumbent may pray in aid of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> and ordinary; that is, that they shall be joined in the action, and help to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. *Voucher* also is the calling in of some person to answer the action, that hath warranted the title to the tenant or defendant. This we still make use of in the form of common recoveries, which are grounded on a writ of entry; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of action that relies chiefly on the weakness of the tenant's title, who therefore vouches another person to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> it. If the voucher appear, he is made defendant instead of the voucher; but if he afterwards makes default, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> shall be had against the original defendant; and he shall recover an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> in value against the deficient vouchee. In assizes, indeed, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> question is, whether the demandant or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> were or were not in possession till the outset happened, and the title of the tenant is little (if at all) difficult, there no voucher is allowed; but the tenant may bring a writ of *warrantia chartae* against the warrantor, to compel him to affit him with a good plea or defence, or else to render damages and the value of the land, if recovered against the tenant. In many real actions also, brought by or against an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 21 years, and also in actions of debt brought against him, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> to any deceased ancestor, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> may suggest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONAGE\">nonage</a> of the infant, and pray that the proceedings may be deferred till his full age, or, in our legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, that the infant may have his age, and that the *parol* may *demur*, that is, that the pleadings may be laid; and then they shall not proceed till his full age, unless it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that he cannot be prejudiced thereby. But by the statutes of Westminster, 3 Edw. I. c. 46. and of Glocester, 6 Edw. I. c. 2. in writs of entry *for differi* in some particular cases, and in actions ancestrally brought by an infant, the parol shall not demur; otherwise he might be deprived of his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and even want a maintenance, till he came of age. So likewise in a writ of dower the heir shall not have his age; for it is necessary that the widow's claim be immediately determined, else she may want a present subsistence. Nor shall an infant patron have it in a *quare impedit*, since the law holds it necessary and expedient that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> be immediately filled.\n\nWhen these proceedings are over, the defendant must then put in his excuse or plea. See *PLEA*.\n\nIt is a rule in pleading, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> be allowed to plead specially such a plea as amounts only to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, or a total denial of the charge; but in such case he shall be driven to plead the general issue in terms, whereby the whole question is referred to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>. But if the defendant, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSIZE\">assize</a> or action of trespass, be desirous to refer the validity of his title to the court rather than the jury, he may state his title specially; and at the same time give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to the plaintiff, or suppose him to have an appearance or colour of title, bad indeed in point of law, but of which the jury are not competent judges. As if his own true title is, that he claims by seisinment with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVERY\">livery</a> from A, by force of which he entered on the lands in question, he cannot plead this by itself, as it amounts to no more than the general issue, *null tort, null differi*, in assize, or not guilty in an action of trespass. But he may allege this specially, provided he goes farther, and says, that the plaintiff claiming by colour of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> of seisinment, without\nPLE\n\nPleadings out livery, entered; upon whom he entered; and may then refer himself to the judgement of the court which of these two titles is the best in point of law.\n\nWhen the plea of the defendant is thus put in, if it does not amount to an issue or total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> of the declaration, but only evades it, the plaintiff may plead again, and reply to the defendant's plea: Either traversing it, that is, totally denying it; as if, on an action of debt upon bond, the defendant pleads falsum ad diem, that he paid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> when due; here the plaintiff in his replication may totally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> this plea, by denying that the defendant paid it: Or he may allege new matter in contradiction to the defendant's plea; as when the defendant pleads no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AWARD\">award</a> made, the plaintiff may reply, and set forth an actual award, and assign a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>: Or the replication may confess and avoid the plea, by some new matter or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, consistent with the plaintiff's former declaration; as in an action for trespassing upon land whereof the plaintiff is seized, if the defendant shows a title to the land by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, and that therefore he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to enter, and gives colour to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may either traverse and totally deny the fact of the descent; or he may confess and avoid it, by replying, that true it is that such descent happened, but that since the descent the defendant himself demised the lands to the plaintiff for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of life.\n\nTo the replication the defendant may rejoin, or put in an answer called a rejoinder. The plaintiff may answer the rejoinder by a fur-rejoinder; upon which the defendant may rebut, and the plaintiff answer him by a fur-rebutter. Which pleas, replications, rejoinders, fur-rejoinders, rebutters, and fur-rebutters, answer to the exceptio, replicatio, duplicatio, triplicatio, and quadruplicatio, of the Roman laws.\n\nThe whole of this process is denominated the pleading; in the several stages of which it must be carefully observed, not to depart or vary from the title or defence which the party has once insisted on. For this (which is called a departure in pleading) might occasion endless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a>. Therefore the replication must support the declaration, and the rejoinder must support the plea, without departing out of it. As in the case of pleading no award made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a bond of arbitration, to which the plaintiff replies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> forth an actual award; now the defendant cannot rejoin that he hath performed this award, for such rejoinder would be an entire departure from his original plea, which alleged that no such award was made: therefore he has now no other choice, but to traverse the fact of the replication, or else to deny upon the law of it.\n\nAgain, all duplicity in pleading must be avoided. Every plea must be simple, entire, connected, and confined to one single point: it must never be entangled with a variety of distinct independent answers to the same matter; which must require as many different replies, and introduce a multitude of issues upon one and the same dispute. For this would often embarrass the jury, and sometimes the court itself, and at all events would greatly enhance the expense of the parties. Yet it frequently is expedient to plead in such a manner as to avoid any implied admission of a fact, which cannot with propriety or safety be positively affirmed or denied. And this may be done by what is called a protestation; whereby the party interposes an oblique allegation or denial of some fact, protesting (by the gerund, protestan-\n\ndo) that such a matter does or does not exist; and at the same time avoiding a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> or denial. Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> hath defined a protestation (in the pithy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a> of that age) to be, \"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>.\" For the use of it is, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the party from being concluded with respect to some fact or circumstance which cannot be directly affirmed or denied without falling into duplicity of pleading; and which yet, if he did not thus enter his protest, he might be deemed to have tacitly waived or admitted. Thus, while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> in villainage subsisted, if a villain had brought an action against his lord, and the lord was inclined to try the merits of the demand, and at the same time to prevent any conclusion against himself that he had waived his figuory; he could not in this case both plead affirmatively that the plaintiff was his villain, and also take issue upon the demand; for then his plea would have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, as the former alone would have been a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to the action: but he might have alleged the villainage of the plaintiff by way of protestation, and then have denied the demand. By this means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> vafalage of the plaintiff was saved to the defendant, in case the issue was found in his (the defendant's?) favour; for the protestation prevented that conclusion which would otherwise have resulted from the rest of his defence, that he had enfranchised the plaintiff, since no villain could maintain a civil action against his lord. So also if a defendant, by way of inducement to the point of his defence, alleges (among other matters) a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEISIN\">seisin</a> or tenure which the plaintiff is unwilling to admit, and yet desires to take issue on the principal point of the defence, he must deny the seisin or tenure by way of protestation, and then traverse the defensive matter. So, lastly, if an award be set forth by the plaintiff, and he can assign a breach in one part of it (viz. the non-payment of a sum of money), and yet is afraid to admit the performance of the rest of the award, or to aver in general a non-performance of any part of it, lest something should appear to have been performed; he may save to himself any advantage he might hereafter make of the general non-performance, by alleging that by protestation, he can plead only the non-payment of the money.\n\nIn any stage of the pleadings, when either side advances or affirms any new matter, he usually (as was said) avers it to be true; \"and this he is ready to verify.\" On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when either side traverses or denies the facts pleaded by his antagonist, he usually tenders an issue, as it is called; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of which is different according to the party by whom it is tendered: for if the traverse or denial comes from the defendant, the issue is tendered in this manner, \"And of this he puts himself upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>,\" thereby submitting himself to the judgement of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a>: but if the traverse lies upon the plaintiff, he tenders the issue or prays the judgement of the peers against the defendant in another form; thus, \"and this he prays may be inquired of by the country.\"\n\nBut if either side (as, for instance, the defendant) pleads a special negative plea, not traversing or denying anything that was before alleged, but disclosing some new negative matter; as where the suit is on a bond conditioned to perform an award, and the defendant pleads, negatively, that no award was made; he tenders no issue upon this plea, because it does not yet appear whether...\nPLE\n\nPleadings, whether the fact will be disputed, the plaintiff not having yet asserted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of any award; but when the plaintiff replies, and seeks forth an actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> award, if then the defendant traverses the replication, and denies the making of any such award, he then, and not before, tenders an issue to the plaintiff. For when in the course of pleading they come to a point which is affirmed on one side and denied on the other, they are then said to be at issue; all their debates being at last contracted into a single point, which must now be determined either in favour of the plaintiff or of the defendant. See Issue.","sp":267,"ep":270},{"h":"PLEASING","t":"art of. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">Politeness</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">PLEASURE</a> is a word so universally understood as to need <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> explanation. Lexicographers, however, who must attempt to explain every word, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it \"the gratification of the mind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> senses.\" It is directly opposite to PAIN, and constitutes the whole of positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, as that does of misery.\n\nThe Author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has furnished us with many pleasures, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as made us liable to many pains; and we are susceptible of both in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as soon as we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and are endowed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>. A French writer, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>* which once raised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> expectations, contends, that a child in the womb of its mother feels neither pleasure nor pain. \"These sensations (says he) are not innate; they have their origin from without; and it is at the moment of our birth that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> receives its first impressions; impressions slight and superficial at the beginning, but which by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and repeated acts leave deeper traces in the sensorium, and become more extensive and more lasting. It is when the child emits forth its first cries that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> or the faculty of sensation is produced, which in a short time gathers strength and stability by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects. Pleasure and pain not being innate, and being only acquired in the same manner as the qualities which we derive from instruction, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, it follows that we learn to suffer and enjoy as we learn any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>.\"\n\nThis is strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> and strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. That sensations are not innate is universally acknowledged; but it does not therefore follow that the soul receives its first impressions and first sensations at the moment of birth. The child has life, the power of locomotion, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of touch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before it is born; and every mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> tell this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> unborn exhibits symptoms both of pain and of pleasure. That many of our organs of sense are improved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> is incontrovertible; but it is so far from being true that our sensible pleasures become more exquisite by being often repeated, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> contrary is experienced of far the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them; and though external objects, by making repeated impressions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the senses, certainly leave deeper traces on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> once perceived can do, it by no means follows that these impressions become the more delightful the more familiar that they are to us. That we learn to suffer and enjoy as we learn any other science, is a most extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>; for it is self-evident that we cannot live without being capable in some degree both of suffering and enjoyment, though a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may certainly live to old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of all the sciences.\n\nThe same writer assures us, indeed, that sensation is not necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> life. \"Philosophers (says he) make mention of a man who had lost every kind of feeling in every member of his body: he was pinched or pricked to no purpose. Meanwhile this man made use of all his members; he walked without pain, he drank, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a>, and slept, without perceiving that he did so. Sensible neither to pleasure nor pain, he was a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> machine.\"\n\nTo the tale of these anonymous philosophers our author gives implicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, whilst he favours us at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> with the following argumentation, which completely proves its falsehood. \"It is true that sensation is a relative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, susceptible of increase and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>; that it is not necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>; and that one might live without it: but in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> he would live as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUTOMATON\">automaton</a>, without feeling pleasure or pain; and he would possess neither idea, nor reflection, nor desire, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, nor will, nor sentiment; his existence would be merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a>, he would live without knowing it, and die without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>.\"\n\nBut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> this man of the philosophers, whom our author calls an automaton, and a true natural machine, had neither idea, nor desire, nor passion, nor will, nor sentiment (and without sensation he certainly could have none of them), what induced him to walk, eat, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>, or to cease from any of these operations after they were accidentally begun? The instances of the automata which played on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a> and at chefs are not to the purpose for which they are adduced; for there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> between them and this natural machine, unless the philosophers wound up their man to eat, drink, walk, or sit, as Vacanson and Kempeler wound up their automata to play or cease from playing on the German flute and at chefs. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDROIDES\">ANDROIDES</a>.\n\nOur author having for a while sported with these harmless paradoxes, proceeds to put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of his reader to the test with others of a very contrary tendency. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTES\">institutes</a> an inquiry concerning the superiority, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and degree, of the pleasures enjoyed by the different orders of men in society; and labours, not indeed by argument, but by loose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>, to propagate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that happiness is very unequally distributed. The pleasures of the rich, he says, must be more numerous and exquisite than those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>; the nobleman must have more enjoyments than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEBEIAN\">plebeian</a> of equal wealth; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, according to him, must be the happiest of all men. He owns, indeed, that although \"birth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, honours, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, add to happiness, a man is not to be considered as miserable because he is born in the lower conditions of life. A man may be happy as a mechanic, a merchant, or a labourer, provided he enters into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of his profession, and has not imbibed by a misplaced education those sentiments which make his condition insupportable. Happiness is of easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> in the middling stations of life; and though perhaps we are unable to know or to rate exactly the pleasure which arises from contentment and mediocrity, yet happiness being a kind of aggregate of delights, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, and of advantages more or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> must have a share of it; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is not exactly made, but all other things equal, there will be more in the elevated than in the inferior conditions of society; the enjoyment will be more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, the means of enjoying more multiplied, and the pleasures more varied. Birth, rank, fortune, talents, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>,\nPleasure, genius, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, are then the great sources of happiness; those advantages are so considerable, that we see men contented with any one of them, but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> forms supreme felicity.\n\n\"There is so vast a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>,\" says Voltaire, \"between a man who has made his fortune and one who has to make it, that they are scarcely to be considered as creatures of the same kind. The same thing may be said of birth, the greatest of all advantages in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> society; of rank, of honours, and of great abilities. How great a difference is made between a person of high birth and a tradesman; between a Newton or Descartes and a simple mathematician? Ten thousand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> are killed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, and it is scarcely mentioned; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, and especially if he be a man of courage and abilities, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> are filled with the news of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>.\n\n\"Frederick the Great, king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, felt in a more lively manner than perhaps any other man the value of great talents. I would willingly renounce,\" said he to Voltaire, \"everything which is an object of desire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> to man; but I am certain if I were not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> I should be nothing. Your merit alone would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> you the esteem and envy, and admiration of the world; but to secure respect for me, titles, and armies, and revenues, are absolutely necessary.\"\n\nFor what purpose this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of human happiness was published, it becomes not us to say. Its obvious tendency is to make the lower orders of society discontented with their state, and envious of their superiors; and it is not unreasonable to suppose, that it contributed in some degree to excite the ignorant part of the author's countrymen to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of those atrocities of which they have since been guilty. That such was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>, the following extract will not permit us to believe; for though in it the author attempts to support the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of human happiness, he mentions virtuous kings with the respect becoming a loyal subject of the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, whose character he seems to have intentionally drawn, and whose death by the authority of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> he has in effect foretold.\n\n\"Happiness, in a state of society, takes the most variable forms: it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTEUS\">Proteus</a> susceptible of every kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAMORPHOSIS\">metamorphosis</a>; it is different in different men, in different ages, and in different conditions, &c. The pleasures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> are very different from those of old age: what affords enjoyment to a mechanic would be supreme misery to a nobleman; and the amusements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> would appear insipid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. Is there then nothing fixed with regard to happiness? Is it of all things the most variable and the most arbitrary? Or, in judging of it, is it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to find a standard by which we can determine the limits of the greatest good to which man can arrive in the present state? It is evident that men form the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the beautiful and sublime in nature, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong in morality, provided they have arrived at that degree of improvement and civilization of which human nature is susceptible; and that different opinions on these subjects depend on different degrees of culture, of education, and of improvement. The same thing may be advanced with regard to happiness: all men, if equal with respect to their organs, would form the very same ideas on this subject if they reached the degree of improvement of which we are presently speaking; and in fact, do we not see in the great circles at Rome, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, that those who are called people of fashion, who have received the same education, have nearly the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, the same desires, and the same spirit for enjoyment? there is doubtless a certain degree of happiness to be enjoyed in every condition of life; but as there are some conditions preferable to others, so are there degrees of happiness greater and less; and if we were to form an idea of the greatest possible in the present state, it perhaps would be that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of a great empire, enjoying good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and a moderate spirit; endowed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and virtue; whose whole life was employed in acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and mercy, and who governed by fixed and unmovable laws. Such a king is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and he must be the idol of a wise people. His whole life should present a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the most august felicity. Although such sovereigns are rare, yet we are not without examples of them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> affords us Titus and Marcus Aurelius, and the present age can boast of piety and munificence in the character of some of its kings. This state of the greatest happiness to which man can reach not being ideal, it will serve as a standard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> by which happiness and misery can be estimated in all civilized countries. He is as happy as a king, is a proverbial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, because we believe with justice that royalty is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of the greatest enjoyments; and in fact, happiness being the work of man, that condition which comprehends all the degrees of power and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, which is the source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and of dignity, and which supposes in the person invested with all means of enjoyment either for himself or others, leaves nothing on this earth to which any reasonable man would give the preference.\n\n\"We can find also in this high rank the extreme of the greatest evils to which the condition of nature is exposed. A king condemned to death and perishing on a scaffold, by the authority of a faction, while at the same time he had endeavoured by every means in his power to promote the general happiness of his subjects, is the most terrible and striking example of human misery; for if it be true that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> is the greatest of all blessings, then the loss of it, and at the same time the loss of life by an ignominious and unjust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, are of all calamities the most dreadful.\n\n\"It is also in the courts of kings that we find the most amiable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>; and it is there where true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, true politeness, the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of manners, the most amiable graces, and the most eminent virtues, are completely established. It is in courts that men seem to have acquired their greatest improvement: Whoever has seen a court, says La Bruyere, has seen the world in the most beautiful, the most enchanting, and attractive colours. The prejudices of mankind in behalf of the great are so extensive, that if they inclined to be good they would be almost the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>.\"\n\nIn this passage there are doubtless many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> observations; but there is at least an equal number of others both false and dangerous. That a crown is the greatest of earthly blessings, and that it is in the courts of kings that we meet with the most amiable and perfect characters, are positions which a true philosopher will not admit but with great limitations. The falsehood of the author's\npleasure. But all pains do not proceed from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. Many of them arise from reducing the body or the mind to a state below indifference. Thus, if a person have just sufficient warmth in his body to keep him barely at ease or in a state of indifference, by withdrawing this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> a state of uneasiness or pain is produced; and if in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> state of mind one be made acquainted with a melancholy event, his quiet is interrupted, and he sinks below indifference into a painful state of mind. If now, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> any new source of positive pleasure, we remove in the former case the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and in the latter the grief, the persons from whom they are removed will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> real pleasure. Thus, then, whether pain arises from excess or deficiency of action, the gradual or the sudden removal of it must be in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> attended with pleasure.* It is equally true that the gradual or sudden removal of pleasure is attended with pain.\n\nWe are now prepared to examine our French author's account of the pleasures and pains of savages. \"Every age (says he) has its different pleasures; but if we were to imagine that those of childhood are equal to those of confirmed age, we should be much mistaken in our estimation of happiness. The pleasures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, either natural or moral, are not unfolded to the infant; the most perfect music is a vain noise; the most exquisite perfumes and dishes highly seasoned offend his young organs instead of affording delight; his touch is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; forty days elapse before the child gives any sign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a> or of weeping; his cries and groans before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> are not accompanied with tears; his countenance expresses no passion; the parts of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> bear no relation to the sentiments of the soul, and are moreover without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a>. Children are but little affected with cold; whether it be that they feel less, or that the interior heat is greater than in adults. In them all the impressions of pleasure and pain are transitory; their memory has scarcely begun to unfold its powers; they enjoy nothing but the present moment; they weep, laugh, and give tones of satisfaction without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>, or at least without reflection; their joy is confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of their little whims, and constraint is the greatest of their misfortunes; few things amuse, and nothing satisfies them. In this happy condition of early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> nature is at the whole expense of happiness; and the only point is not to contradict her. What desires have children? Give them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in all their movements, and they have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENITUDE\">plenitude</a> of existence, an abundance of that kind of happiness which is confined in some sort to all the objects which surround them: but if all beings were happy on the same conditions, society would be at no expense in procuring the happiness of the different individuals who compose it. Sensation is the foundation of reflection; it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> of the soul; it is by this that man is elevated to sublime speculations, and secures his dominion over nature and himself. This quality is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, but susceptible, like all other relative qualities, of increase and decay, of different degrees of strength and intensity: it is different in different men; and in the same man it increases from infancy to youth, from youth to confirmed manhood: at this period it stops, and gradually declines as we proceed to old age and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> childhoods. Considered physically, it varies according to age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and food; considered in a moral point of view, it...\nPleasure of view, it takes its different appearances from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> education, and from the habits of society; for man in a state of nature and society, with regard to sensation and the unfolding of his powers, may be considered as two distinct beings: and if one were to make a calculation of pleasure in the course of human life, a man of fortune and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> enjoys more than ten thousand savages.\n\n\"Pleasure and pain being relative qualities, they may be almost annihilated in the moment of vehement passion. In the heat of battle, for example, ardent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> spirits have not felt the pain of their wounds; and minds strongly penetrated with sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, enthusiasm, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, have supported the most cruel torments with courage and fortitude. The sensibility of some persons is so exquisitely alive, that one can scarcely approach them without throwing them into convulsions. Many diseases show the effect of sensibility pushed to an extreme; such as hysterical affections, certain kinds of madness, and some of those which proceed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, and from the bite or sting of certain animals, as the viper and the tarantula. Excessive joy or grief, fear and terror, have been known to destroy all sensation, and occasion death.\"\n\nHaving made these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> observations on pleasure and pain in infancy, and as they are increased or diminished by education, and the different conditions of body and mind, our author proceeds to consider the capability of savages to feel pleasure and pain. \"By savages he understands all the tribes of men who live by hunting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, and on those things which the earth yields without cultivation. Those tribes who possess herds of cattle, and who derive their subsistence from such possessions, are not to be considered as savages, as they have some idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. Some savages are naturally compassionate and humane, others are cruel and sanguinary. Although the physical constitution of man be everywhere the same, yet the varieties of climate, the abundance or scarcity of natural productions, have a powerful influence to determine the inclinations. Even the fierceness of the tiger is softened under a mild sky; now nature forms the manners of savages just as society and civil institutions form the manners of civilized life. In the one case climate and food produce almost the whole effect; in the other they have scarcely any influence. The habits of society every moment contend with nature, and they are almost always victorious. The savage devotes himself to the dominion of his passions; the civilized man is employed in restraining, in directing, and in modifying them: so much influence have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, laws, society, and the fear of censure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, over his soul.\n\n\"It is not to be doubted that savages are susceptible of both pleasure and pain; but are the impressions made on their organs as sensible, or do they feel pain in the same degree with the inhabitants of a civilized country?\n\n\"Their enjoyments are so limited, that if we confine ourselves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> will be sufficient to describe them: our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> must therefore be confined to pain, because the manner in which they support misfortune, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a>, presents us with a view of character unequalled in the history of civilized nations. It is not uncommon in civilized countries to see men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> death, meeting it with cheerfulness, and even not uttering complaints under the torture; but they do not infuse the executioners of public vengeance, and defy pain in order to augment their torments; and those who are condemned by the laws suffer the punishment with different degrees of fortitude. On those mournful occasions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> ranks of mankind in general die with less firmness: those, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, who have received education, and who, by a train of unfortunate events, are brought to the scaffold, whether it be the fear of being reproached with cowardice, or the consideration that the stroke is inevitable, such men discover the expiring sighs of self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> even in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> moments; and those especially of high rank, from their manners and sentiments, are expected to meet death with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>: but an American savage in the moment of punishment appears to be more than human; he is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> of the first order, who braves his tormentors, who provokes them to employ all their art, and who considers as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> glory to bear the greatest degree of pain without shrinking (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">AMERICA</a>, No. 14, 27, 28, 29.). The recital of their tortures would appear exaggerated, if it were not attested by the best authority, and if the savage nations among whom those customs are established were not sufficiently known; but the excess of the cruelty is not so astonishing as the courage of the victim. The European exposed to sufferings of the same dreadful nature would rend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> and earth with his piercing cries and horrible groans; the reward of martyrdom, the prospect of eternal life, could alone give him fortitude to endure such torments; but the savage is not animated with this exalted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>. What supports him then in scenes of so exquisite suffering? The feeling of shame, the fear of bringing reproach on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, and giving a stain to his fellows never to be wiped away, are the only sentiments which influence the mind of a savage, and which always present to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, animate him, support him, and lend him spirit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. At the same time, however powerful those motives may be, they would not be alone sufficient, if\n\n(a) There are instances of persons who have died at the noise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> without being touched. A man frightened with the fall of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> in which he happened to be, was immediately seized with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>. M. le Cat mentions a young person on whom the influence of another made such an impression, that his countenance became at first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and then changed into black, in such a manner that in less than eight days he appeared to wear a mask of black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>: he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in this state for four months, without any other symptom of bad health or any pain. A sailor was so terrified in a storm, that his face sweated blood, which like ordinary sweat returned as it was wiped off. Stahl, whose testimony cannot be called in question, cites a similar case of a girl who had been frightened with soldiers. The excess of fear, according to many physicians, produces madness and epilepsy.\nPleasure, the savage felt pain in the same degree with the European. Sensibility, as we have already observed, is increased by education; it is influenced by society, manners, laws, and government; climate and food work it into a hundred different shapes; and all the physical and moral causes contribute to increase and diminish it. The habitual existence of a savage would be a state of suffering to an inhabitant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. You must cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of the one and tear it away with your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, before you can make him feel in an equal degree to a scratch or prick of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> in the other. The savage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOUBTING\">doubting</a>, suffers under torture, but he suffers much less than an European in the same circumstances: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> is obvious; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> which the savages breathe is loaded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a> and moist vapours; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> not being confined by high banks, are by the winds as well as in floods spread over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> fields, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> on them a putrid and pernicious slime; the trees squeezed one upon another, in that rude and uncultivated country serve rather as a covering to the earth than an ornament. Instead of those fresh and delicious shades, those openings in the woods, and walks crossing each other in all directions, which delight the traveller in the fine forests of France and Germany; those in America serve only to intercept the rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and to prevent the benign influence of his beams. The savage participates of this cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a>; his blood has little heat, his humours are grofs, and his constitution phlegmatic. To the powerful influence of climate, it is necessary to join the habits of his life. Obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> vast deserts for subsistence, his body is accustomed to fatigue; food not nourishing, and at the same time in no great plenty, blunts his feelings; and all the hardships of the savage state give a rigidity to his members which makes him almost incapable of suffering. The savage in this state of nature may be compared to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-women and street-porters, who, though they possess neither great vigour nor strength, are capable of performing daily, and without complaint, that kind of labour which to a man in a different condition of life would be a painful and grievous burden. Feeling, in less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> with the savage, by the effects of climate and food, and the habits of his life, is still farther restrained by moral considerations. The European is less a man of nature than of society: moral restraints are powerful with him; while over the American they have scarcely any influence. This latter then is in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> condition of imperfection with regard to us; his senses are blunted, and his moral powers are not disclosed. Now, pleasure and pain depending on the perfection of the senses and the unfolding of the intellectual faculties, it cannot be doubted, that in enjoyments of any kind savages experience less pleasure, and in their sufferings less pain, than Europeans in the same circumstances. And in fact, the savages of America possess a very feeble constitution. They are agile without being strong; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGILITY\">agility</a> depends more on their habits than on the perfection of their members: they owe it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of hunting; and they are moreover so weak, that they were unable to bear the toil which their first oppressors imposed on them. Hence a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of men in all respects imperfect could not endure torment under which the most robust European would sink, if the pain which they feel were really as great as it appears to be. Feeling is then, and must necessarily be, less in the savage condition; for pleasure, this faculty disclosing itself by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of all the physical and moral qualities, must be less as they are less exercised. Everything shows the imperfection of this precious quality, this source of all our affections, in the American savages.\n\n\"All the improvements in Europe have had a tendency to unfold sensibility: the air is purified that we may breathe more freely; the morals are drained, the rivers are regulated in their courses, the food is nourishing, and the houses commodious. With the savages, on the contrary, every thing tends to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CURB\">curb</a> it; they take pleasure even in hardening the organs of the body, in accustoming themselves to bear by degrees the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> pain without complaining. Boys and girls among the savages amuse themselves with tying their naked arms together, and laying a kindled coal between them, to try which of them can longest suffer the heat; and the warriors who aspire to the honour of being chief, undergo a course of suffering which exceeds the idea of torture inflicted on the greatest criminals in Europe.\"\n\nThese observations on the pleasures and pains of savages appear to be well-founded, and, as the attentive reader will perceive, are perfectly agreeable to the theory of Dr Sayers. If indeed that theory be just, as we believe it to be, it will follow, that the few pleasures of sense which the American enjoys, he ought to enjoy more completely than any European, because to him they recur but seldom. This may very possibly be the case; and certainly would be so, were not his fibres, by climate and the habits of his life, rendered more rigid than those of the civilized part of the inhabitants of Europe. But if we agree with our author * in what he says of the pains and pleasures of savages, we cannot admit, without many exceptions, his theory of the enjoyments of children. It is so far from being true, that few things amuse, and that nothing satisfies them, that the direct contrary must have been observed by every man attentive to the operations of the infant mind, which is amused with everything new, and often completely satisfied with the merest trifle. The pleasures of philosophy are not indeed unfolded to the infant; but it by no means follows that he does not enjoy his rattle and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUM\">drum</a> as much as the philosopher enjoys his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a> and air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>; and if there be any truth in the science of physiognomy, the happiness of the former is much more pure and exquisite than that of the latter. That the most perfect music is vain noise to an infant, is far from being self-evident, unless the author confines the state of infancy to a very few months; and we are not disposed to believe, without better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> than we have yet received, that the relish of exquisite perfumes and highly-scented dishes adds much to the sum of human felicity.\n\nBut however much we disapprove of many of these reflections, the following we cordially adopt as our own.\n\n\"If we compare (says our author) the pleasures of sense with those which are purely intellectual, we shall find that the latter are infinitely superior to the former, as they may be enjoyed at all times and in every situation of life. What are the pleasures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, says Cicero, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAMING\">gaming</a>, and of women, compared with the delights of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>? This taste increases with age, and no happiness...\nPleasure, happiness is equal to it. Without knowledge and study, say Cato, life is almost the image of death (9). The pleasures of the soul are such, that it is frequent enough to see men preserve their gaiety during their whole life, notwithstanding a weak, defeated, and debilitated body. Scaron, who lived in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, was an example of this. Balzac, speaking of him, says, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMETHEUS\">Prometheus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, and Philocetes, in profane, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> in sacred history, said many great things while they were afflicted with violent pain; but Scaron alone said pleasant things. I have seen, continues he, in many places of ancient history, constancy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and eloquence, accompanying affliction; but he is the only instance wherein I have seen pleasantry.\n\nThere are men whose understandings are constantly on the stretch, and by this very means they are improved; but if the body were as constantly employed in the pursuit of sensual gratification, the constitution would soon be destroyed. The more we employ the mind we are capable of the greater exertion; but the more we employ the body we require the greater repose. There are besides but some parts of the body capable of enjoying pleasure; every part of it can experience pain. A toothache occasions more suffering than the most considerable of our pleasures can procure of enjoyment. Great pain may continue for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time; excessive pleasures are almost momentary. Pleasure carried to an extreme becomes painful; but pain, either by augmenting or diminishing it, never becomes agreeable. For the moment, the pleasures of the senses are perhaps more satisfactory; but in point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> those of the heart and mind are infinitely preferable. All the sentiments of tenderness, of friendship, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and of generosity, are sources of enjoyment for man in a state of civilization. The damned are exceedingly unhappy, said St Catherine de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>, if they are incapable of loving or being beloved.\n\nPleasure, continued for a great length of time, produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUOR\">languor</a> and fatigue, and excites <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>; the continuation of pain is productive of none of these effects. Many suffer pain for eight days and even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> without interruption; an equal duration of excessive pleasure would occasion death.\n\nTime is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> relative idea with regard to pleasure and pain; it appears long when we suffer, and short when we enjoy. If there existed no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and uniform movement in nature, we would not be able from our sensations alone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> time with any degree of exactness, for pain lengthens and pleasure abridges it. From the languor of unoccupied time has arisen the proverb expressive of our desire to kill it. It is a melancholy reflection, and at the same time true, that there is no enjoyment which can effectually secure us from pain for the remainder of our lives; while there are examples of evils which hold men in constant sorrow and pain during their whole existence. Such then is the imperfection of the one and the power of the other.\n\nPleasure and pain are the sources of morality; an action is just or unjust, good or otherwise, only as its natural tendency is to produce suffering or enjoyment to mankind. No crime could be committed against a being altogether indefensible, nor could any good be bestowed on it. Unless he were endowed with the desire of pleasure and the apprehension of pain, man, like an automaton, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> from necessity, without choice and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>.\n\nAll our passions are the development of sensibility. If we were not possessed of feeling, we should be destitute of passions; and as sensibility is augmented by civilization, the passions are multiplied; more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and vigorous in an extensive and civilized empire than in a small state; more in the latter than among barbarous nations; and more in these last than among savages (see Passion). There are more passions in France and England than in all the nations of Europe; because every thing which serves to excite and foster them is always in those countries in the greatest state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>. The mind is active; the ideas great, extensive, and multiplied. And is it not the soul, the mind, and heart, which are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of all the passions?\n\nBut wherever the passions are multiplied, the sources of pleasure and pain are multiplied with them. This being the case, it is impossible to prescribe a fixed and general rule of happiness suited to every individual. There are objects of pleasure with regard to which all men of a certain education are agreed; but there are perhaps many more, owing to the variety of temperaments and education, about which they differ. Every man forms ideas of enjoyment relative to his character; and what pleases one may be utterly detested by another. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> is civilized and extensive, those differences are remarkable. Savages, who are not acquainted with all the variety of European pleasures, amuse themselves with very few objects. Owing to the want of civilization, they have scarcely any choice in the objects of taste. They have few passions; we have many. But even in the nations of Europe pleasure is infinitely varied in its modification and forms. Those differences arise from manners, from governments, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> customs, and chiefly from education. Meanwhile, however different and variable the ideas of pleasure may be among nations and individuals, it still remains a fact, that a certain number of persons in all civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, whether distinguished by birth, rank, or fortune, or talents, as they have nearly the same education so they form nearly the same ideas of happiness; but to possess it a man must give his chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the state of his mind; and notwithstanding all his efforts it is of uncertain duration. Happiness is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of life: we enjoy it frequently at great intervals; and it is therefore necessary to know how to use\n\n(B) \"Savages, barbarians, and peasants, enjoy little happiness except that of sensation, The happiness of a civilized and well-informed man consists of sensations, of ideas, and of a great number of affinities, altogether unknown to them.

The following, however, are instances: polyanthus, hyacinth, primrose, crocus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>-saffron, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>-apple; though Kramer has asserted that a full flower with one petal is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms. In flowers with one petal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of luxuriance, or impletion, is by a multiplication of the divisions of the limb or upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>; in flowers with more petals than one, by a multiplication of the petals or nectarium.\n\nTo take a few examples. Columbine is rendered full\nin three different ways: 1. By the multiplication of its petals, and total exclusion of the nectaria; 2. By the multiplication of the nectaria, and exclusion of the petals; or, 3. By such an increase of the nectaria only as does not exclude the petals, between each of which are interjected three nectaria, placed one within another. Again, fennel-flower is rendered full by an increase of the nectaria only; narcissus, either by a multiplication of its cup and petals, or of its cup only; larkspur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> by an increase of the petals and exclusion of the spur, which is its nectarium. In *Japonaria concava anglica*, the impletion is attended with the finger-like effect of incorporating the petals, and reducing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> from five to one; and in gilder-rofe, the luxuriance is effected by an increase both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> and number of the circumference or margin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of flowers, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, wheel-shaped, barren florets; and an exclusion of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-shaped hermaphrodite florets of the centre or disk.\n\nHitherto we have treated of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENITUDE\">plenitude</a> in simple flowers only: the instance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now adduced seems to connect the different modes of impletion in them and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> flowers. Before proceeding farther, however, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be improper to premise, that as a simple luxuriant flower is frequently, by beginners, mistaken for a compound flower in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state, such flowers may always be distinguished with certainty by this rule: That in simple flowers, however luxuriant, there is but one pistillum or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> organ; whereas in compound flowers, each floret, or partial flower, is furnished with its own proper pistillum. Thus in hawk-weed, a compound flower, each flat or tongue-shaped floret in the aggregate has its five stamens and naked seed, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is in effect its pistillum; whereas, in a luxuriant lychis, which is a simple flower, there is found only one pistillum or female organ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to the whole.\n\nIn a compound radiated flower, which generally consists of plain florets in the margin or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a>, and tubular or hollow florets in the centre or disk, plenitude is effected either by an increase of the florets in the margin, and a total exclusion of those in the disk; which mode of luxuriance is termed *impletion by the radius*, and resembles what happens in the gilder-rofe: or by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> of the hollow florets in the centre, and a less profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of their brims; which is termed *impletion by the disk*. In the first mode of luxuriance, the florets in the centre, which are always hermaphrodite or male, are entirely excluded; and in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> succeed florets similar in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> to those of the radius. Now as the florets in the margin of a radiated compound flower are found to be always either female, that is, furnished with the pistillum only; or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEUTER\">neuter</a>, that is, furnished with neither stamens nor pistillum; it is evident, that a radiated compound flower, filled by the radius, will either be entirely female, as in feverfew, daisy, and African marigold; or entirely neuter, as in sunflower, marigold, and centaury: hence it will always be easy to distinguish such a luxuriant flower from a compound flower with plain florets in a natural state; as these flowers are all hermaphrodite, that is, furnished with both stamens and pistillum. Thus the full flowers of African marigold have each floret furnished with the pistillum or female organ only: the natural flowers of dandelion, which, like the former, is composed of plain florets, are furnished with both stamens and pistillum.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> mode of luxuriance, termed *impletion by the disk*, the florets in the margin sometimes remain unchanged: but most commonly adopt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of those in the centre, without, however, suffering any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in point of sex; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> is less to be apprehended from this mode of luxuriance than from the former; besides, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> to which the florets in the centre run out is of itself a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, and adapted to excite at once an idea of luxuriance. Daisy, feverfew, and African marigold, exhibit instances of this as well as of the former mode of impletion.\n\nIn luxuriant compound flowers with plain florets, the *semiflora* of Tournefort, the stigma or summit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> in each floret is lengthened, and the seed-buds are enlarged and diverge; by which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> such flowers may always be distinguished from flowers of the same kind in a natural state. Scorzonera, nipple-wort, and goat's-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>, furnish frequent instances of the plenitude alluded to.\n\nLastly, the impletion of compound flowers with tubular or hollow florets, the *flocculus* of Tournefort, seems to observe the same rules as that of radiated flowers just delivered. In everlastings-flower, the *xeranthemum* of Linn\u00e6us, the impletion is finger-like, being effected by the enlargement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the inward chaffy scales of the calyx. These scales, which become coloured, are greatly augmented in length, so as to overtop the florets, which are scarce larger than those of the same flower in a natural state. The florets too in the margin, which in the natural flower are female, become, by luxuriance, barren; that is, are deprived of the pistillum; the style, which was very short, spreads, and is of the length of the chaffy scales; and its summits, formerly two in number, are metamorphosed into one.\n\nFull flowers are more easily referred to their respective genera in methods founded upon the calyx, as the flower-cup generally remains unaffected by this highest degree of luxuriance.","sp":276,"ep":277},{"h":"PLEONASM","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>*, whereby we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> words seemingly superfluous, in order to express a thought with the greater energy; such as, \"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it with my own eyes,\" &c.

Of this fatal circumstance, Bishop Burnet, in his Travels, p. 96, gives the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>. \"Having mentioned (says the Bishop) some falls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> in these parts (viz. near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>), I cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> fate of the town of Pleurs, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from Chavennes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>.\u2014The town was half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of Chavennes, but much more nobly built; for, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the Francken, that cost some millions, there were many other palaces built by rich factors both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> and the other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, who, liking the situation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the freedom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, gave themselves all the indulgences that a vast wealth could furnish. By one of the palaces that was a little distant from the town, and was not overwhelmed with it, one may judge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. It was an out-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Francken, and yet it may compare with many palaces in Italy. The voluptuousness of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> became very crying; and Madame de Salis told me that she heard her mother often relate some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of a Protestant minister's sermons that preached in a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> there, who warned them often of the terrible judgements of God which were hanging over their heads, and which he believed would suddenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out upon them.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> the 25th of August 1618, an inhabitant came and told me to be gone, for he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the mountains cleaving; but he was laughed at for his pains. He had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> whom he prevailed to leave all and go with him; but when she was safe out of town, she called to mind that she had not locked the door of a room in which she had some things of value, and so she went back to do that, and was buried with the rest; for at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a> the hill fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and buried the town and all the inhabitants, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 2200, so that not one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> escaped. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the mountains did so fill the channel of the river, that the first news of Chavennes had of it was by the failing of their river; for three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> there came not a drop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, but the river wrought for itself a new course, and returned to them.\n\n\"I could hear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> particular character of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who escaped (continues the Bishop); so I must leave the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of so singular a preservation to the great discovery, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, of those steps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> that are now to unaccountable.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is, unwholesome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; for although Poland is not deficient in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> that which is nearest at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, taken indiscriminately from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and even stagnant pools. The third cause is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> inattention of the natives to cleanliness; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> shows, that those who are not negligent in their persons and habitations, are less liable to be afflicted with the plica than others who are deficient in that particular.

He bore arms in a distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>; was one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of augurs; became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENDANT\">intendant</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; and was employed in several important affairs by Vespasian and Titus, who honoured him with their esteem. The eruption of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, which happened in the year 79, proved fatal to him. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, relates the circumstances of that dreadful eruption, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his uncle, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Tacitus. Pliny the Elder wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> in 37 books, which is still extant, and has had many editions; the most esteemed of which is that of Father Hardouin, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1723, in two volumes folio.\n\n**PLINY the Younger,** nephew of the former, was born in the ninth year of Nero, and the 62d of Christ, at Novocomum, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> upon the lake Larius, near which he had several beautiful villas. C\u00e6cilius was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of his father, and Plinius Secundus that of his mother's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, who adopted him. He brought into the world with him fine parts and an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, which he did not fail to cultivate early; for, as he tells us himself, he wrote a Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> at 14 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. He lost his father when he was young; and had the famous Virginius for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a>, whom he has set in a glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. He frequented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of the rhetoricians, and heard Quintilian; for whom he ever after entertained so high an esteem, that he bestowed a considerable portion upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>. He was in his 18th year when his uncle died; and it was then that he began to plead in the forum, which was the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to dignities. About a year after, he assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> character, and went into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a>: but this did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> his taste any more than it had done Tully's; and therefore we find him returning after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> or two. He tells us, that in his passage homewards he was detained by contrary winds at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> Icaria, and how he employed himself in making verses: he enlarges in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> upon his poetical exercises; yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> was not the shining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his character any more than it had been of Tully's.\n\nUpon his return from Syria, he married a wife, and settled at Rome: it was in the reign of Domitian. During this most perilous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to plead in the forum, where he was not more distinguished by his uncommon abilities and eloquence, than by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> and courage, which enabled him to speak boldly, when scarcely one else durst speak at all. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> these accounts he was often singled out by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the plundered provinces against their oppressive governors, and to manage other causes of a like important and dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. One of these was for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Batavia, in their prosecution of Baebius Maffa; in which he acquired so general an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Nerva, then a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and in banishment at Tarentum, wrote to him a letter, in which he congratulated not only Pliny, but the age which had produced an example so much in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>. Pliny relates this affair in a letter to Cornelius Tacitus; and he was so pleased with it himself, that he could not help entreating this friend to record it in his history. He entreats him, however, with infinitely more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> than Tully had intreated Lucceius upon the same occasion; and though he might imitate Cicero in the request, as he professes to have constantly let that great man before him for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, yet he took care not to transgress the bounds of decency in his manner of making it. He obtained the offices of quaestor and tribune, and luckily went unhurt through the reign of Domitian: there is, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to suppose, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> that emperor had not died <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as he did, that Pliny would have shared the fate of many other great men; for he tells us himself, that his name was afterwards found in Domitian's tables, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of those who were destined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>.\n\nHe lost his wife in the beginning of Nerva's reign, and soon after married his beloved Calpurnia, of whom we read so much in his Epistles. He had not, however, any children by any of his wives: and hence we find him thanking Trajan for the *jus trium liberorum*, which he afterwards obtained of that emperor for his friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SUETONIUS_TRANQUILLUS\">Suetonius Tranquillus</a>. He hints also, in his letter of thanks to Trajan, than he had been twice married in the reign of Domitian. He was promoted to the consulship by Trajan in the year 100, when he was 38 years of age; and in this office pronounced that famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a>, which has ever since been admired, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> for the copiousness of the topics as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>. Then he was elected augur, and afterwards made proconsul of Bithynia; whence he wrote to Trajan that curious letter concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; which, with Trajan's receipt, is happily extant among his Epistles. Pliny's letter, as Mr McIlmoth observes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> upon the passage, is esteemed as almost the only genuine monument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> antiquity relating to the times immediately succeeding the apostles, it being written at most not above 40 years after the death of St Paul. It was preserved by the Christians themselves, as a clear and unsuspicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the purity of their doctrines, and is frequently appealed to by the early writers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> against the calumnies of their adversaries. It is not known what became of Pliny after his return from Bithynia; whether he lived at Rome, or what time he spent at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> houses. Antiquity is also silent as to the time of his death: but it is conjectured that he died either a little before or soon after that excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, his admired Trajan; that is, about the year of Christ 116.\n\nPliny was one of the greatest wits, and one of the worthiest\nworthiest men among the ancients. He had five parts, which he cultivated to the utmost; and he accomplished himself with all the various kinds of knowledge which could serve to make him either useful or agreeable. He wrote and published a great number of things; but nothing has escaped the wreck of time except the books of Letters, and the panegyric upon Trajan. This has ever been considered as a masterpiece; and if he has, as some think, almost exhausted all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in a prince, and gone perhaps a little beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, yet it is allowed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> panegyric was ever possessed of a finer subject, and on which he might better indulge in all the flow of eloquence, without incurring the suspicion of flattery and lies. His letters seem to have been intended for the public; and in them he may be considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a>. Every epistle is a kind of historical sketch, wherein we have a view of him in some striking attitude either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> or contemplative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In them are preserved anecdotes of many eminent persons, whose works have come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to us, as Suetonius, Silius Italicus, Martial, Tacitus, and Quintilian; and of curious things, which throw great light upon the history of those times. They are written with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and spirit; and if they abound too much in turn and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>, we must impute it to that degeneracy of taste which was then accompanying the degenerate manners of Rome. Pliny, however, seems to have preserved himself in this latter respect from the general contagion: whatever the manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> were, his were pure and incorrupt. His writings breathe a spirit of transcendent goodness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>: his only imperfection is, he was too desirous that the public and posterity should know how humane and good he was.

Amongst several MSS. which he left behind him were large materials for the \"Natural History of Kent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\" Besides the above works, he published De origine fontium tenimmen philosophicum, 8vo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> papers in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nPlot, in dramatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, is sometimes used for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>; but more properly for the knot or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a>, which makes the embarrassment of any piece.

He was born at Lycompis, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, in 204; and began very early to show a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> singularity both in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and manners: for, at eight years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, when he went to school, he used to run to his nurse, and uncover her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> to suck; and would have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> that practice longer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had not been discouraged by her. At 28 years of age he had a strong desire to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> which occasion he was recommended to the most famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>. He was not satisfied with their lectures; but,\nPlotinus, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIUS\">Ammonius</a>, he confessed that this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> he wanted. He studied for 11 years under that excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, and then went to hear the Persian and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> philosophers: for in 243, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GORDIANUS\">Gordianus</a> intended to wage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> against the Persians, he followed the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, but probably repented of it; for it was with difficulty he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> by flight, after the emperor had been slain. He was then 39; and the year following he went to Rome, and read philosophical lectures in that city; but avoided following the example of Erennius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>, his fellow-pupils, who, having promised with him not to reveal some hidden and excellent doctrines they had received from Ammonius, had nevertheless forfeited their word. Plotinus continued ten years in Rome, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> anything; but, in his 50th year, Porphyry became his scholar; who, being of an exquisitely fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, was not satisfied with superficial answers, but required to have all difficulties thoroughly explained; and therefore Plotinus, to treat things with greater accuracy, was obliged to write more books. He had before written 21 books, and during the six years of Porphyry's stay with him he wrote 24, and 9 after Porphyry's leaving Rome, in all 54. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> veneration for him; and he passed for a man of such judgement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, that many persons of both sexes, when they found themselves dying, intrusted him, as a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> angel, with the care of their estates and children. He was the arbiter of numberless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>-suits; and constantly behaved with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and rectitude of mind, that he did not create himself one enemy during the 26 years he resided in Rome. He, however, did not meet with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> from all of his own profession; for Olympias a philosopher of Alexandria, being envious of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, used his utmost endeavours, though in vain, to ruin him. The emperor Gallienus, and the empress Salonina, had a very high regard for him; and, had it not been for the opposition of some jealous courtiers, they would have had the city of Campania rebuilt, and given to him with the territory belonging to it, to establish a colony of philosophers, and to have it governed by the ideal laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s commonwealth. He laboured under various disorders during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> year of his life, which obliged him to leave Rome, when he was carried to Campania to the heirs of one of his friends, who furnished him with everything necessary; and he died there in the year 270, at the age of 66, and in the noblest manner that an heathen philosopher could do, these being his words as he breathed his last: \"I am labouring with all my might to return the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of me to the Divine Whole which fills the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>.\"\n\nWe have already remarked that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of Plotinus were singular and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>; and we shall now show that they were so. He was ashamed of being lodged in a body, for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> he did not care to tell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his birth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. The contempt he had for all earthly things, was the reason why he would not permit his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> to be drawn: and when his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> Amelius was urgent with him upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, \"Is it not enough (said he) to drag after us, whithersoever we go, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> has shut us up? Do you think that we should likewise transmit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> ages an image of that image, as a sight worthy of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>?\" From the same principle, he refused to attend to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>; for he never made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of preservatives or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, and did not even eat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of tame animals. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> but little, and abstained very often from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>; which joined to his intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITATION\">meditation</a>, kept him very much from sleeping. In short, he thought the body altogether below his notice; and had so little respect for it, that he considered it as a prison, from which it would be his supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> to be freed. When Amelius, after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, inquired about the state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the oracle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, he was told, \"that it was gone to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the blessed, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, joy, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with God prevail.\" And the reason given for it, as related by Porphyry, is, \"that Plotinus had been peaceable, gracious, and vigilant; that he had perpetually elevated his thoughts foul to God; that he had loved God with his whole heart; that he had disengaged himself, to the utmost of his abilities, from this wretched life; that, elevating himself with all the powers of his soul, and by the several gradations taught by Plato, towards that Supreme Being which fills the universe, he had been enlightened by him; had enjoyed the vision of him without the help or interposition of ideas; had, in short, been often united to him.\" This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of Porphyry, who tells us also, that he himself had once been favoured with the vision. To this account, however, we need scarcely add, that little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> is due: it agrees pretty much with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> enthusiasm and the reveries of Eckhaimists. Plotinus had also his familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>; but, according to Porphyry, it was not one of those called demons, but of the order of those who are called gods; so that he was under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of a genius superior to that of other men. The superiority of his genius puffed him up not a little: for when Amelius desired him to share in the sacrifices, which he used to offer up on solemn festivals, \"It is their business (replied Plotinus) to come to me, not mine to go to them;\" \"which lofty answer (says Porphyry) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one could guess the reason of, or dared to ask.\"\n\nPorphyry put the 54 books of Plotinus in order, and divided them into five enneads. The greater part of them turn on the most high-flown ideas in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>; and this philosopher seems, in certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, not to differ much from Spinoza. He wrote two books to prove, that \"all being is one and the same;\" which is the very doctrine of Spinoza. He inquires, in another book, \"Whether there are many souls, or only one?\" His manner of composing partook of the singularity of his nature: he never read over his compositions after he had written them; he wrote a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and was not exact in his orthography: he stood in need, therefore, of a faithful friend to revise and correct his writings; and he chose Porphyry for this purpose before Amelius, who had, however, been his disciple 24 years, and was very much esteemed by him. Some have accused Plotinus of plagiarism, with regard to Numenius; a slander which Amelius refuted. Longinus was once much prejudiced against our great philosopher, and wrote against his Treatise of Ideas, and against Porphyry's answer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of that treatise. He afterwards conceived a high esteem for him; fought industriously for all his books; and, in order to have them very correct, desired Porphyry to lend him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>; but at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> wrote to him in the following manner: \"I always observed to you, when we were together,\"\nPLU\n\nPlotius\n\nPluche.\n\ngether, when we were at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from one another, as well as when you lived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, that I did not comprehend many of the subjects treated of by Plotinus; but that I was extremely fond of his manner of writing, the variety of his knowledge, and the order and disposition of his questions, which are altogether philosophical.\" \"This fingle passage (says Bayle) flows the exalted genius, the exquisite discernment, and judicious penetration of Longinus. It cannot be denied, that most subjects which this philosopher examines are incomprehensible; nevertheless, we discover in his works a very elevated, fruitful, and capacious genius, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. Had Longinus been an injudicious critic, had he not possessed an exalted and beautiful genius, he would not have been so sensible of Plotinus's obscurity: for no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> complains less of the obscurity of a book, than those whose thoughts are confused and undertaking is shallow.\" Marius Ficinus, at the request of Cosmo de Medicis, made a Latin version of the works of Plotinus, with a summary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of each book; which was printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, first by himself, in 1559, and afterwards with the Greek in 1580, folio.

But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> article in plumbery is sheets and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> of lead; and as these make the basis of the plumber's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, we shall here give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of making them.\n\nIn casting sheet-lead, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> mould is made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, which consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pieces of wood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> jointed, and bound with bars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> at the ends; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the sides of which runs a frame consisting of a ledge or border of wood, three inches thick and four inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> from the mould, called the sharps: The ordinary width of the mould, within these sharps, is from four to five feet; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> is 16, 17, or 18 feet. This should be something longer than the sheets are intended to be, in order that the end where the metal runs off from the mould may be cut off, because it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> thin or uneven, or ragged at the end. It must stand very even or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> in breadth, and something falling from the end in which the metal is poured in, viz. about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> or an inch and a half in the length of 16 or 17 feet or more, according to the thickness of the sheets wanted; for the thinner the sheet, the more declivity the mould should have. At the upper end of the mould stands the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a>, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> triangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, composed of two planks nailed together at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and two triangular pieces fitted in between them at the ends. The length of this pan is the whole breadth of the mould in which the sheets are cast; it stands with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, which is a sharp edge, on a form at the end of the mould, leaning with one side against it; and on the opposite side is a handle to lift it up by, to pour out the melted lead; and on that side of the pan next the mould are two iron hooks to take hold of the mould, and prevent the pan from slipping while the melted lead is pouring out of it into the mould. This pan is lined on the inside with moistened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, to prevent it from being fired by the hot metal. The mould is also spread over; about two inches thick, with sand fitted and moistened, which is rendered perfectly level by moving over it a piece of wood called a strike, and smoothing it over with a smoothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, which is a plate of polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, about one-fourth of an inch thick and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, turned up on all the four edges, and with a handle fitted on to the upper or concave side. The sand being thus smoothed, it is fit for casting sheets of lead; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they would cast a cistern, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> out the signs of the four sides; and having taken the dimensions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> or fore-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDINGS\">mouldings</a> by prefixing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> slips of wood, which contain the same mouldings, into the level sand; and form the figures of birds, beasts, &c. by prefixing in the same manner leaden figures upon it, and then taking them off; and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> smoothing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> where any of the sand is raised up by making these impressions upon it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the operation is the same in casting either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CISTERNS\">cisterns</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> sheets of lead. But before we proceed to mention the manner in which that is performed, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to give a more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the strike. The strike, then, is a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> about five inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and something longer than the breadth of the mould on the inside; and at each end is cut a notch about two inches deep, so that when it is used it rides upon the sharps with those notches. Before they begin to cast, the strike is made ready by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-TACKING\">tacking</a> on two pieces of an old hat on the notches, or by flipping a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> over each end, in order to raise the under side about one-eighth of an inch or something more above the sand, according as they would have the sheet to be in thickness; then they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> the under edge of the strike, and lay it across the mould. The lead being melted, it is put into the pan with ladles, in which, when there is a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> for the present purpose, the scum of the metal is swept off with a piece of board to the edge of the pan, letting it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> on the sand, which is by this means prevented from falling into the mould at the pouring out of the metal. When the lead is cool enough, which must be regulated according to the thickness of the sheets wanted, and is known by its beginning to stand with a shell or wall on the sand round the pan, two men take the pan by the handle, or else one of them lifts it by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> fixed to a beam in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a>, and pour it into the mould, while another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> stands ready with the strike, and, as soon as they have done pouring in the metal, puts on the mould, sweeps the lead forward, and draws the overplus into a trough prepared to receive it. The sheets being thus cast, nothing remains but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> them up or cut them into any measure wanted: but if it be a cistern, it is bent into four sides, so that the two ends may join the back, where they are soldered together; after which the bottom is soldered up.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of casting pipes without soldering.\u2014To make\nPlumbery make these pipes they have a kind of little mill, with arms or levers to turn it withal. The moulds are of braids, and consist of two pieces, which open and shut by means of hooks and hinges, their inward calibre or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> being according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, usually two feet and a half. In the middle is placed a core or round piece of braids or iron, somewhat longer than the mould, and of the thickness of the inward diameter of the pipe. This core is passed through two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> runnels, one at each end of the mould, which they serve to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; and to these is joined a little copper tube about two inches long, and of the thickness the leaden pipe is intended to be of. By means of these tubes, the core is retained in the middle of the cavity of the mould. The core being in the mould, with the runnels at its two ends, and the lead melted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, they take it up in a ladle, and pour it into the mould by a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> at one end, made in the form of a funnel. When the mould is full, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a hook into the end of the core, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the mill, draw it out; and then opening the mould, take out the pipe. If they desire to have the pipe lengthened, they put one end of it in the lower end of the mould, and pass the end of the core into it; then shut the mould again, and apply its runnel and tube as before, the pipe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> cast serving for a runnel, &c., at the other end. Things being thus replaced, they pour in fresh metal, and repeat the operation till they have got a pipe of the length required.\n\nFor making pipes of sheet-lead, the plumbers have wooden cylinders, of the length and thickness required; and on these they form their pipes by wrapping the sheet around them, and soldering up the edges all along them.\n\nThe lead which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> the Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-boxes is reduced to a thinness which we are informed European plumbers cannot imitate.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTER\">cutter</a> sits by a pot containing the melted metal; and has two large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, the under one fixed, the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a>, directly before him. He raises the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> his foot upon the side of it, and with an iron ladle pours in the opening a proper quantity of the fluid metal. He then immediately lets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> the upper stone, and by that means forms the lead into a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> plate, which is afterwards cut into a proper shape.

A remedy was attempted for this abuse at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of Lateran under Alexander III. and Innocent III. in the year 1215, when the holding more than one benefice was forbidden by a canon under the penalty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRIVATION\">deprivation</a>; but the same canon granting the pope a power to dispense with it in favour of persons of distinguished merit, the prohibition became almost useless.

Plutarch's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> in Chaeronia; his grandfather Lamprias was eminent for his learning and a philosopher; and is often mentioned by Plutarch in his writings, as is also his father. Plutarch was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a> early in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, to which he was naturally inclined; and was placed under the care of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIUS\">Ammonius</a>, an Egyptian, who, having taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> with great reputation at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, from thence travelled into Greece, and settled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>. Under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> he made great advances in knowledge; and like a thorough philosopher, more apt to regard things than words, he purified this knowledge to the neglect of languages. The Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was not only the language of Rome, but of Greece also: and much more used there than the French is now in England. Yet he was so far from regarding it then, that, as we learn from himself, he became not conversant in it till the declension of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>: and, though he is supposed to have resided in Rome near 40 years at different times, yet he never seems to have acquired a competent skill in it. But this was not the worst: he did not cultivate his mother-tongue with any great exactness; and hence that harshness, inequality and obscurity in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, which has so frequently and justly been complained of.\n\nAfter he was principled and grounded by Ammonius, having an inextinguishable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> for knowledge, he resolved to travel. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> was at that time, as formerly it had been, famous for learning; and probably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of their doctrine might tempt him, as it had tempted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> and others, to go and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with the priesthood of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This appears to have been particularly his bent, by his travels Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSIRIS\">Osiris</a>: in which he shows himself versed in the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> and philosophy of the wise men. From Egypt he returned into Greece; and visiting in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of the philosophers, gathered from them many of those observations with which he has abundantly enriched posterity. He does not seem to have been attached to any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>, but culled from each of them whatever he thought excellent and worthy to be regarded. He could not bear the paradoxes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOICS\">Stoics</a>, but yet was more averse from the impiety of the Epicureans: in many things he followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>; but his favourites were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> he revered to highly, that he annually celebrated their birth-days with much solemnity. Besides this, he applied himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> diligence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> not only all books that were excellent in their kind, but also all the sayings and observations of wise men which he had heard in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> had received from others by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>; and likewise to consult...\nPlutarch fulf the records and public instruments preserved in cities which he had visited in his travels. He took a particular journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, to search the archives of that famous commonwealth, to understand thoroughly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of their ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of their legislators, their kings, and their ephori; and digested all their memorable deeds and sayings with much care. He took the same methods with regard to many other commonwealths; and thus was enabled to leave us in his works such a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABINET\">cabinet</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> upon men and manners, as, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Montaigne and Bayle, have rendered him the most valuable author of antiquity.\n\nThe circumstances of Plutarch's life are not known, and therefore cannot be related, with any exactness. According to the learned Fabricius, he was born under Claudius, 50 years after the Christian era. He was married to a most amiable woman of his own native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, according to the probable conjecture of Rualdus, was Timoxena, and to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> he has borne the most affectionate testimony in his moral works. He had several children, and among them two sons; one called Plutarch after himself, the other Lamprias in memory of his grandfather. Lamprias was he, of all his children, who seems to have inherited his father's philosophy; and to him we owe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> or catalogue of Plutarch's writings, and perhaps also his aphorisms. He had a nephew, Sextus Chaeronius, who taught the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Marcus Aurelius the Greek tongue, and was much honoured by him. Some think, that the critic Longinus was of his family; and Apuleius, in the first book of his Metamorphoses, affirms himself to be defended from him.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> what occasion, and at what time of his life, he went to Rome, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> he lived there, and when he finally returned to his own country, are all uncertain. It is probable, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of him went thither before him, not only because he had published several of his works, but because immediately upon his arrival, as there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe, he had a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> to hear him: for he tells us himself, that he was taken up in giving lectures of philosophy to the great men of Rome, that he had not time to make himself master of the Latin tongue, which is one of the first things that would naturally have engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. It appears that he was several times at Rome; and perhaps one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for his living there was the intimacy he had contracted in some of these journeys with Soffius Senecio, a great and worthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who had been four times <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, and to whom Plutarch has dedicated many of his lives. But the great inducement which carried him first to Rome, was undoubtedly that which had carried him into so many other parts of the world; namely, to make observations upon men and manners, and to collect materials for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the lives of the Roman worthies, in the same manner as he had already written those of the Grecian: and accordingly he not only conversed with all the living, but searched the records of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPITOL\">Capitol</a>, and of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>. Not but, as we learn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIDAS\">Suidas</a>, he was instructed also with the management of public affairs in the empire, during his residence in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. \"Plutarch (says he) lived in the time of Trajan, who befriended him the consular ornaments, and also caused an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> to be passed, that the magistrates or officers of Illyria should do nothing in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> without his knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>.\"\n\nWhen and how he was made known to Trajan is likewise uncertain: but it is generally supposed that Trajan, a private man when Plutarch first came to Rome, was, among other nobility, one of his auditors. It is also supposed, that this wise emperor made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of him in his councils; at least, much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his reign has been imputed to Plutarch. Fabricius asserts that he was Trajan's preceptor, and that he was raised to the consular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> by him, and made procurator of Greece in his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> by the emperor Adrian. We are equally at a loss concerning the time of his abode in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> city; which, however, at different times, is not imagined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> much short of 40 years. The desire of visiting his native country, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to all men, and especially when growing old, prevailed with him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> to leave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>: and at his return he was unanimously chosen archon or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of Chaeronia, and not long after admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the Delphic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>'s priests. We have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, either as to the manner of it or the year; only it is evident that he lived, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his studies, to a good old age. The most probable conjecture is that of Fabricius, who says he died in the fifth year of Adrian, at the age of 70.\n\nHis works have been divided, and they admit of a pretty equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, into Lives and Morals: the former of which, in his own estimation, were to be preferred as more noble than the latter. His style, as we have already observed, has been excepted to with some reason: he has also been criticised for some mistakes in Roman antiquities, and for a little partiality to the Greeks. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he has been justly praised for the copiousness of his fine sense and learning, for his integrity, and for a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of goodness which appears in all he wrote. His bufnells was not to please the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, but to instruct and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> the mind; and in this none ever went beyond him. Of his moral writings it is to be regretted that we have no elegant English translation. Even his Lives were chiefly known to the English reader by a motley and miserable version, till a new one executed with fidelity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> was presented to the public by the Langhorns in 1770. On the whole, it is to be wished that this most amiable moralist and biographer had added a life of himself to those which he has given to the world of others, as the particulars which other writers have preferred of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> history are very doubtful and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>.","sp":285,"ep":286},{"h":"PLUTO","t":"in Pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the infernal regions, was the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> and Ops, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>.

At the painter's return to Naples, he informed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of these particulars, whose curiosity was so greatly excited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, that he took a journey to the place, and made drawings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> views. These were shown to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Naples, who ordered the ruins to be cleared, and Positum arose from the obscurity in which it had remained for upwards of 700 years, as little known to the neighbouring inhabitants as to travellers.\"\n\nOur author gives the following description of it in its present state. It is, says he, of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, about two miles and a half in circumference. It has four gates, which are opposite to each other. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> gate, on the outside, is the figure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a> in bas-relief, and within a hippocampus. The walls which still remain are composed of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cubical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and are extremely thick, in some parts 18 feet. That the walls have remained unto this time is owing to the very exact manner in which the stones are fitted to one another (a circumstance observed universally in the masonry of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>), and perhaps in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to a stalactite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCRETION\">concretion</a> which has grown over them. On the walls here and there are placed towers of different heights; those near the gates being much higher and larger than the others, and evidently of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> workmanship. He observes, that, from its situation among marshes, bituminous and sulphurous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, Positum must have been unwholesome; a circumstance mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a>, Morbofam eam facit fluvius in paludes diffusus. In such a situation the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> must have been bad. Hence the inhabitants were obliged to convey that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> from purer springs by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a>, of which many vestiges still remain.\n\nThe principal monuments of antiquity are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, and three temples. The theatre and amphitheatre are much ruined. The first temple is hexastylos,","sp":396,"ep":396},{"h":"POETRY","t":"A MIDST those thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> which envelope the first ages of the world, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> throw some lights <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the origin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> employment of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> art. Reason suggests, that before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of letters, all the people of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of transmitting to their descendants the principles of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies, their laws, and the renowned actions of their sages and heroes, than by poetry; which included all these objects in a kind of hymns that fathers sung to their children, in order to engrave them with indelible strokes in their hearts. History not only informs us, that Moses and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRIAM\">Miriam</a>, the first authors that are known to mankind, sung, on the borders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a> of divine praise, to celebrate the deliverance which the Almighty had vouchsafed to the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a>, by opening a passage to them through the waters; but it has also transmitted to us the song itself, which is at once the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> monument and a masterpiece of poetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.\n\nThe Greeks, a people the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>, and in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> the most accomplished, that the world ever produced\u2014strove to rival from the Hebrews the precious gift of poetry, which was vouchsafed them by the Supreme Author of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, that they might ascribe it to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> deities. According to their ingenious fictions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> became the god of poetry, and dwelt on the hills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHOCIS\">Phocis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELICON\">Helicon</a>, whose feet were washed by the waters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIPPOCRENE\">Hippocrene</a>, of which each mortal that ever drank was seized with a sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> swans floated on its waves. Apollo was accompanied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">Muses</a>\u2014those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>\u2014the daughters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">Memory</a>: and he was constantly attended by the Graces. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEGASUS\">Pegasus</a>, his winged courier, transported him with a rapid flight into all the regions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>. Happy emblems! by which we at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> embellish our poetry, as no one has ever yet been able to invent more brilliant images.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of all nations afford vestiges of poetry from the remotest ages. They are found among the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> of the ancient barbarians, and the most desolate of all the Americans. Nature asserts her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Tacitus mentions the verses and the hymns of the Germans, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when that rough people yet inhabited the woods, and while their manners were still savage. The first inhabitants of Russia and the other northern countries, those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBION\">Albion</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IBERIA\">Iberia</a>, Aquitania, and other nations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, had their poetry, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the ancient people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and of the known borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. But the simple productions of nature have constantly something unformed, rough, and savage. The Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">Wisdom</a> appears to have placed the ingenious and polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of mankind on the earth, in order to refine that which comes from her bosom rude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>: and thus art has polished poetry, which issued quite naked and savage from the brains of the first of mankind.\n\nBut what is Poetry? It would be to abridge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> limits of the poetic empire, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of poetry. This divine art, should we say, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of all the dictionaries and other treatises on verification, that poetry is the art of making verses, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> periods that are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METRE\">metre</a>. This is rather a grammatical explanation of the word, than a real definition of the thing, and it would be to degrade poetry thus to define it. The father of criticism has denominated poetry \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, an imitative art: but this, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> in itself, is too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> for a definition, as it does not discriminate poetry from other arts which depend equally on imitation. The justest definition seems to be that given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIELFELD\">Bielfeld</a> *, That poetry is the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEM\">Elem</a>. of art of expressing our thoughts by fiction. In fact, it is an art. Under this manner (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we reflect with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>) that all the metaphors and allegories, all the various kinds of fiction, form the first materials of a poetic edifice: it is thus that all images, all comparisons, allusions, and figures, especially those which personify moral subjects, as virtues and vices, concur to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> of such a structure.\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, therefore, that is filled with invention, that incessantly presents images which render the reader attentive and affected, where the author gives interlacing sentiments to every thing that he makes speak, and where he makes speak by sensible figures all those objects which would affect the mind but weakly when clothed in a simple prosaic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, such a work is a poem. While that, though it be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, which is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIDACTIC\">didactic</a>, dogmatic, or moral nature, and where the objects are presented in a manner quite simple, without fiction, without images or ornaments, cannot be called poetry, but merely a work in verse; for the art of reducing thoughts, maxims, and periods, into rhyme or metre, is very different from the art of poetry.\n\nAn ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, a lively and interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, the sublime narrative of the actions of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELEMACHUS\">Telemachus</a> of M. Fenelon, though written in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>, but in measured prose, is therefore a work of poetry: because the foundation and the superstructure are the productions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, as the whole proceeds from fiction; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> itself appears to have employed an innocent and agreeable deception to instruct with efficacy. This is so true, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> also, in order to please and affect, has recourse to fiction; and this part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> is called the *poetic composition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>*. It is therefore by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of fiction that poetry, so to speak, paints its expressions, that it gives a body and a mind to its thoughts, that it animates and exalts that which would otherwise have remained arid and insensible. It is the peculiar privilege of poetry to exalt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> things into animals, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> into persons. The former licence is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, that it is now considered as nothing more than a characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a> appropriated by the poets to distinguish themselves from the writers of prose; and it is at the same time so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, that we question much if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of composition could subsist without it: for it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> perhaps, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, be found, that in every poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> some of the qualities of Animal Nature are ascribed to things not having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Every work, therefore, where the thoughts are expressed by fictions or images, is poetical; and every work where they are expressed naturally, simply, and without ornament, although it be in verse, is prose.\n\nVerse, however, is not to be regarded as foreign or superfluous to poetry. To reduce those images, those fictions, into verse, is one of the greatest difficulties in poetry, and one of the greatest merits in a poem: and for these reasons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADENCE\">cadence</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of sounds, particularly that of rhyme, delight the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, and the mind infensibly repeats them while the eye reads them. There results therefore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to the mind, and a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to these ornaments; but this pleasure would be frivolous, and even childish, if it were not attended by a real utility. Verses were invented in the first ages of the world, merely to aid and to strengthen the memory: for cadence, harmony, effectual and especially rhyme, afford the greatest affluence to poetry, one of the memory that art can invent; and the images, or of its excellent fictions, that strike our senses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a> in graving them with such deep traces in our minds, as even time itself frequently cannot efface. How many excellent apophthegms, sentences, maxims, and precepts, would have been buried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of oblivion, if poetry had not preserved them by its harmony? To give more efficacy to this lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, the first poets sung their verses, and the words and phrases must necessarily have been reduced, at least to cadence, or they could not have been susceptible of musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. One of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> excellencies, therefore, though not a necessary constituent of poetry, consists in its being expressed in verse. See Part III.\n\n**Part I. General Principles of the Art.**\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">Essence</a> and End of Poetry.**\n\nThe essence of Polite Arts in general, and consequently of poetry in particular, consists in expression; and we think that, to be poetical, the expression must necessarily arise from fiction, or invention. (See the article Art, particularly from No. 12. to the end.) This invention, which is the fruit of happy genius alone, arises:\n\n1. From the subject itself of which we undertake to treat;\n2. From the manner in which we treat that subject, or the species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> of which we make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>;\n3. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> that we propose to follow in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to this manner; and,\n4. From the method of executing this plan in its full detail. Our first guides, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, afford us no lights that can elucidate all these objects in general. The precepts which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, relate to epic and dramatic poetry only; and which, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, confirms our idea, that antiquity itself made the essence of poetry to consist in fiction, and not in that species of verse which is delusive of it, or in that which is not capable of it. But since this art has risen to a great degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; and as poetry, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, communicates its fire to every thing it touches, and animates and embellishes whatever it treats; there seems to be no subject in the universe to which poetry cannot be applied, and which it cannot render equally brilliant and pleasing. From this universality of poetry, from its peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of expression by fiction, which is applicable to all subjects, have arisen its different species, of which a particular description will be given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> part.\n\nHorace, in a well-known verse, has been supposed to declare the end of poetry to be twofold, to please, or to instruct:\n\n*Aut prodere volunt, aut declarare poetae.*\n\nBut Dr Beattie maintains, that the ultimate end of this art is to instruct; instruction being only one of the poetry means (and not always a necessary one) by which that end is to be accomplished. The passage rightly understood, he observes, will not appear to contain any part of thing inconsistent with this doctrine. The author is chap. i. there stating a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the Greek and Roman writers, with a view to the poetry of the stage; and, after commending the former for their correctness, and for the liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> wherewith they conducted their literary labours, and blaming his countrymen for their inaccuracies.\nEnd of Poetry.\n\nHor. Ar. Poet. 333\u2014347.\n\nHor. Carm. Mb. iv. ode 9.\n\nHor. Sat. fib. i. sat. 4. ver. 42.\n\nSect. II. Of the Standard of Poetical Invention.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>'s beautiful description of the heavens and earth, as they appear in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> evening by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> and stars, concludes with this circumstance, \"And the heart of the shepherd is glad.\" Madame Dacier, from the turn she gives to the passage in her version, seems to think, and Pope, in order perhaps to make out his couplet, inferrates, that the gladness of the shepherd is owing to his sense of the utility of those luminaries. And this may in part be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>; but this is not in Homer; nor is it a necessary consideration. It is true, that, in contemplating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> universe, they who discern the causes and effects of things must be more rapturously entertained than those who perceive nothing but shape and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. Yet, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> outside of Nature's work, there is a splendour and a magnificence to which even untutored minds cannot attend without great delight.\n\nNot that all peasants or all philosophers are equally susceptible of these charming impressions. It is strange to observe the callousness of some men, before whom all the glories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> and earth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> in daily succession, without touching their hearts, elevating their fancy, or leaving any durable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>. Even of those who pretend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, how many are there to whom the lustre of the rising or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; the sparkling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> of the midnight sky; the mountain-forest tossing and roaring to the storm, or warbling with all the melodies of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>-evening; the sweet interchange of hill and dale, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> and sunlight, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a> offers to the view; the scenery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, so lovely, so majestic, and so tremendous; and the many pleasing varieties of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, could never afford so much real satisfaction, as the teams and noise of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>-room, the insipid fiddling and squeaking of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a>, or the vexations and wranglings of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARD\">card</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>!\n\nBut some minds there are of a different make; who, even in the early part of life, receive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of Nature a species of delight which they would hardly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for any other, and who, as avarice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> are not the infirmities of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, would, with equal sincerity and rapture, exclaim,\n\nI care not, Fortune, what you me deny;\nYou cannot rob me of free Nature's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>;\nYou cannot shut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a> of the sky,\nThrough which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a> shows her bright'ning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>;\nYou cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> my constant feet to trace\nThe woods and lawns by living stream at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a>.\n\nCaffe of Indolence.\n\nSuch minds have always in them the seeds of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and frequently of imitative genius. At least, though their enthusiastic or visionary turn of mind (as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of the world would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it) should not always incline them to practice poetry or painting, we need not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to affirm, that without some portion of this enthusiasm no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> ever became a true poet or painter. For he who would imitate the works of nature, must first accurately observe them; and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> is to be expected from those only who take great pleasure in it.\n\nTo a mind thus disposed no part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> is indifferent. In the crowded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> and howling wilderness; in the cultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> and solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a>; in the murmur of the rivulet and in the uproar of the ocean; in the radiance of summer and gloom of winter; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> of heaven and in the whisper of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREEZE\">breeze</a>; he still finds something to rouse or to soothe his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, to draw forth his affections, or to employ his understanding. And from every mental energy that is not attended with pain, and even from some of those that are, as moderate terror and pity, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> mind derives satisfaction; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> being equally necessary to the body and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, and to both equally productive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and pleasure.\n\nThis happy sensibility to the beauties of nature should be cherished in young persons. It engages them to contemplate the Creator in his wonderful works; it purifies and harmonizes the soul, and prepares it for moral and intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>; it supplies an endless source of amusement; it contributes even to bodily health; and, as a first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> subsists between material and moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, it leads the heart by an easy transition from the one to the other; and thus recommends <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> for its transcendent loveliness, and makes vice appear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>\nobject of contempt and abomination. An intimate acquaintance with the best descriptive poets, Spenser, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, and Thomson, but above all with the divine Georigic, joined to some practice in the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, will promote this amiable sensibility in early years: for then the face of nature has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> superadded to its other charms, the passions are not pre-engaged, the heart is free from care, and the imagination warm and romantic.\n\nBut not to insist longer on those ardent emotions that are peculiar to the enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of nature, may it not be affirmed of all men, without exception, or at least of all the enlightened part of mankind, that they are gratified by the contemplation of things <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, as opposed to unnatural? Monstrous sights please but for a moment, if they please at all; for they derive their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> from the beholder's amazement, which is quickly over. We read indeed of a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>*, who chooseth to adorn his villa with pictures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of most unnatural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>: but it is a singular instance; and one would not be much more surprized to hear of a person living without food, or growing fat by the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. To say of any thing, that it is contrary to nature, denotes censure and disapprobation on the part of the speaker; as the epithet natural intimates an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and seems for the most part to imply, that a thing is as it ought to be, suitable to our own taste, and congenial with our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. Think with what sentiments we should peruse a poem, in which nature was totally misrepresented, and principles of thought and of operation supposed to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, repugnant to every thing we had seen or heard of:\u2014in which, for example, avarice and coldness were ascribed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, and prodigality and passionate attachment to the old; in which men were made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> at random, sometimes according to character, and sometimes contrary to it; in which cruelty and envy were productive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, and beneficence and kind affection of hatred; in which beauty was invariably the object of dislike, and ugliness of desire; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> was rendered happy by atheism and the promiscuous perpetration of crimes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and fortitude were held in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> contempt.\n\nOr think, how we should relish a painting, where no regard was had to the proportions, colours, or any of the physical laws, of Nature:\u2014where the ears and eyes of animals were placed in their shoulders; where the sky was green and the grass crimson; where trees grew with their branches in the earth and their roots in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; where men were seen fighting after their heads were cut off, ships sailing on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, lions entangled in cobwebs, sheep preying on dead carcases, fishes sporting in the woods, and elephants walking on the sea. Could such figures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> give pleasure, or merit the appellation of sublime or beautiful? Should we hesitate to pronounce their author mad? And are the absurdities of madmen proper subjects either of amusement or of imitation to reasonable beings?\n\nLet it be remarked, too, that though we distinguish our internal powers by different names, because otherwise we could not speak of them so as to be understood, they are all but so many energies of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> mind; and therefore it is not to be supposed, that what contradicts any one leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> should yield permanent delight to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. That cannot be agreeable to reason, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> disapproves; nor can that gratify imagination, which is repugnant to reason.\u2014Besides, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> and acquiescence of mind are pleasant, as distrust and disbelief are painful; and therefore, that only can give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and general satisfaction, which has something of plausibility in it; something which we conceive it possible for a rational being to believe. But no rational being can acquiesce in what is obviously contrary to nature, or implies palpable absurdity.\n\nPoetry, therefore, and indeed every art whose end is to please, must be natural; and if so, must exhibit real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of fact, or something like it; that is, in other words, must be either according to truth or according to verisimilitude.\n\nAnd though every part of the material universe abounds in objects of pleasurable contemplation, yet nothing in nature so powerfully touches our hearts, or gives so great variety of exercise to our moral and intellectual faculties, as man. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> affairs and human feelings are universally interesting. There are many who have no great relish for the poetry that delineates only irrational or inanimate beings; but to that which exhibits the fortunes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and the conduct of men, there is hardly any person who does not listen with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> and delight. And hence to imitate human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, is considered by Aristotle as essential to this art; and must be allowed to be essential to the most pleasing and most instructive part of it, Epic and Dramatic composition. Mere descriptions, however beautiful, and moral reflections, however just, become tiresome, where our passions are not occasionally awakened by some event that concerns our fellow-men. Do not all readers of taste receive peculiar pleasure from those little tales or episodes with which Thomson's descriptive poem on the Seasons is here and there enlivened? and are they not sensible, that the thunder-form would not have been half so interesting without the tale of the two lovers (Simm. v. 1171); nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, without that of Palemon and Lavinia (Aut. v. 177.) nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> snows, without that exquisite picture of a man perishing among them (Winter, v. 276.) It is much to be regretted, that Young did not employ the same artifice to animate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">Night</a>-Thoughts. Sentiments and descriptions may be regarded as the pilasters, carvings, gildings, and other decorations of the poetical fabric: but human actions are the columns and the rafters that give it stability and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a>. Or, changing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>, we may consider these as the soul which informs the lovely frame; while those are little more than the ornaments of the body.\n\nWhether the pleasure we take in things natural, and our dislike to what is the reverse, be the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> or of constitution, is not a material inquiry. There is nothing absurd in supposing, that between the foul, in its first formation, and the rest of nature, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> harmony and sympathy may have been established, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> may indeed confirm, but no perverse habits could entirely subdue. As no sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> could make man believe the contrary of a self-evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, great influence should imagine, that our love of nature and regularity of sentiment might still remain with us in some degree, though we had never been born and bred in the Sicilian villa above-mentioned, of course and never heard any thing applauded but what deserved upon cenure, nor cenured but what merited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>. Yet poetry, habit must be allowed to have a powerful influence over the\nthe sentiments and feelings of mankind; for objects to which we have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> accustomed, we are apt to contract a fondness: we conceive them readily, and contemplate them with pleasure; nor do we quit our old tracks of speculation or practice without reluctance and pain. Hence in part arises our attachment to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, our old acquaintance, our native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, our homes, and to the very hills, streams, and rocks in our neighborhood. It would therefore be strange, if man, accustomed as he is from his earliest days to the regularity of nature, did not contract a liking to her productions and principles of operation.\n\nYet we neither expect nor desire, that every human invention, where the end is only to please, should be an exact transcript of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. It is enough, that the mind acquiesce in it as probable or plausible, or such as we think might happen without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to the laws of nature:\u2014Or, to speak more accurately, it is enough that it be consistent, either, first, with general experience; or, secondly, with popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; or, thirdly, that it be consistent with itself, and connected with probable circumstances.\n\nFirst: If a human invention be consistent with general experience, we acquiesce in it as sufficiently probable. Particular experiences, however, there may be, so uncommon, and so little expected, that we should not admit their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, if we did not know them to be true. No man of sense believes, that he has any likelihood of being enriched by the discovery of hidden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>; or thinks it probable, on purchasing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTTERY\">lottery</a>-ticket, that he shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>; and yet great wealth has actually been acquired by such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>. But we should look upon these as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> expedients in a play or romance for bringing about a happy catastrophe. We expect that fiction should be more consonant to the general tenor of human affairs; in a word, that not possibility, but probability, should be the standard of poetical invention.\n\nSecondly: Fiction is admitted as conformable to this standard, when it accords with received opinions. These may be erroneous, but are not often apparently repugnant to nature. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, and because they are familiar to us from our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, the mind readily acquiesces in them, or at least yields them that degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> which is necessary to render them pleasing: hence the fairies, ghosts, and witches of Shakespeare, are admitted as probable beings; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> obtain a place in religious pictures though we know that they do not now appear in the scenery of real life. A poet who should at this day make the whole action of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> depend upon enchantment, and produce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> events by the assistance of supernatural agents, would indeed be censured as transgressing the bounds of probability, be banished from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> to the nursery, and condemned to write <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">fairy</a> tales instead of tragedies. But Shakespeare was in no danger of such censures: In his days the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a> was established both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and by the fashion; and it was not only unpolite, but criminal, to doubt it. Now indeed it is admitted only by the vulgar; but it does not therefore follow that an old poem, invented built upon it should not be acceptable to the learned themselves. When a popular opinion has long been exploded, and has become repugnant to philosophical belief, the fictions built upon it are still admitted as natural, both because we all remember to have listened to them in childhood with some degree of credit, and because we know that they were accounted natural by the people to whom they were first addressed; whose sentiments and views of things we are willing to adopt, when, by the power of pleasing description, we are introduced into their scenes, and made acquainted with their manners. Hence we admit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> of the ancient poets, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELYSIUM\">Elysium</a> and Tartarus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYLLA\">Scylla</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARYBDIS\">Charybdis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYCLOPS\">Cyclops</a> and Circe, and the rest of those \"beautiful wonders\" (as Horace calls them) which were believed in the heroic ages; as well as the demons and enchantments of Fafo, which may be supposed to have obtained no small degree of credit among the Italians of the 16th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, and are suitable enough to the notions that prevailed universally in Europe not long before (a). In fact, when poetry is in other respects true, when it gives an accurate display of those parts of nature about which we know that men in all ages must have entertained the same opinion, namely, those appearances in the visible creation, and those feelings and working of the human mind, which are obvious to all mankind:\u2014when poetry is thus far according to nature, we are very willing to be indulgent to what is fictitious in it, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> a temporary allowance to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of fable which the author pleases to adopt; provided that he lay the scene in a distant country, or fix the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> to a remote period. This is no unreasonable piece of complaisance; we owe it both to the poet and to ourselves; for without it we should neither form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> estimate of his genius, nor receive from his works that pleasure which they were intended to impart. Let him, however, take care, that his system of fable be such as his countrymen and contemporaries (to whom his work is immediately addressed) might be supposed capable of yielding their assent to; for otherwise we should not believe him to be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a>; and let him convey it as much as he can with probable circumstances, and make it appear in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of events consistent with itself.\n\nFor (thirdly) if this be the case, we shall admit his story as probable, or at least as natural, and consequently be interested in it, even though it be not warranted by general experience, and derive but slender authority from popular opinion. Caliban, in the Tempest, would have shocked the mind as an improbability, if we had not been made acquainted with his origin, and seen his character <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in a series of consistent behaviour. But when we are told that he sprung from a witch and a demon, a connection not contrary to the laws of nature, as they were understood in Shakespeare's time, and find his manners conformable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, we are easily reconciled to the fiction. In the same sense, the Lilliputians of\n\n(a) In the 14th century, the common people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> believed that the poet Dante went down to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>; that the Inferno was a true account of what he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> there; and that his fellow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, and stunted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> (which seemed by its growth and colour to have been too near the fire), were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his passing so much of his time in that hot and smoky region. See Vicende della Letteratura del Sig. G. Denina, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 4.\nof Swift may pass for probable beings; not so much because we know that a belief in pignies was once current in the world (for the true ancient pigny was at least thrice as tall as those whom Gulliver visited), but because we find that every circumstance relating to them accords with itself, and with their supposed character. It is not the size of the people only that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a>; their country, seas, ships, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, are all in exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>; their theological and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> principles, their passions, manners, customs, and all the parts of their conduct, betray a levity and littleness perfectly suitable; and so simple is the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a>, and apparently so artless and sincere, that we should not much wonder if it had imposed (as we have been told it has) upon some persons of no contemptible understanding.\n\nThe same degree of credit may perhaps for the same reasons be due to his giants. But when he grounds his narrative upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to nature; when he presents us with rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>, and irrational men; when he tells us of horses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> houses for habitation, milking cows for food, riding in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, and holding conversations on the laws and politics of Europe; not all his genius (and he there exerts it to the utmost) is able to reconcile us to so monstrous a fiction: we may smile at some of his absurd exaggerations; we may be pleased with the energy of style, and accuracy of description, in particular places; and a malevolent heart may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> in the satire; but we can never relish it as a fable, because it is at once unnatural and self-contradictory. Swift's judgement seems to have forsaken him on this occasion: he wallows in nastiness and brutality: and the general run of his satire is downright defamation. Lucian's True History, is a heap of extravagancies put together without order or unity, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> authors. His ravings, which have no better right to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of fable, than a hill of rubbish has to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, are destitute of every colour of plausibility. Animal trees, ships sailing in the sky, armies of monstrous things travelling between the sun and moon on a pavement of cobwebs, rival nations of men inhabiting woods and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> in a whale's belly,\u2014are like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of a bedlamite than the inventions of a rational being.\n\nIf we were to prosecute this subject any farther, it would be proper to remark, that in some kinds of poetical invention a stricter probability is required than in others:\u2014that, for instance, Comedy, whether dramatic or narrative (B), must seldom deviate from the ordinary course of human affairs, because it exhibits the manners of real and even of familiar life.\u2014that the tragic poet, because he imitates characters more exalted, and generally refers to events little known, or long since past, may be allowed a wider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a>; but must never attempt the marvellous fictions of the epic muse, because he addresses his work, not only to the passions and imagination of mankind, but also to their eyes and ears, which are not easily imposed on, and refuse to be gratified with any representation that does not come very near the truth:\u2014that the epic poem may claim still ampler privileges, because its fictions are not subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a> of any outward sense, and because it conveys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> in regard both to the highest human characters, and the most important and wonderful events, and also to the affairs of unseen worlds and superior beings. Nor would it be improper to observe, that the several species of comic, of tragic, of epic composition, are not confined to the same degree of probability: for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a> may be allowed to be less probable than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> comedy; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASQUE\">masque</a> than the regular tragedy; and the mixed epic, such as the Fairy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>, and Orlando Furioso, than the pure epopee of Homer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, and Milton. But this part of the subject seems not to require further illustration. Enough has been said to show, that nothing unnatural can please; and that therefore poetry, whose end is to please, must be according to nature.\n\nAnd if so, it must be either according to real nature, or according to nature somewhat different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>.\n\nSect. III. Of the System of Nature exhibited by Poetry.\n\nTo exhibit real nature is the business of the historian; who, if he were strictly to confine himself to his own sphere, would never record even the minutest circumstance of any speech, event, or description, which was not warranted by sufficient authority. It has been the language of critics in every age, that the historian ought to relate nothing as true which is false or dubious, and their works to conceal nothing material which he knows to be true, by fiction. But it is to be doubted whether any writer of profane and make history has ever been so scrupulous. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a> himself, who began his history when that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> began which he records, and who set down every event soon after it happened, according to the most authentic information, seems, however, to have indulged his fancy not a little in his harangues and descriptions, particularly that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>: and the same thing has been practised, with greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, by Livy and Tacitus, and more or less by all the best historians both ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>. Nor are they to be blamed for it. By these improved or invented speeches, and by the heightenings thus given to their descriptions, their work becomes more interesting, and more useful; nobody is deceived, and historical truth is not materially affected. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> is, however, to be observed in this, as in other things. When the historian lengthens a description into a detail of fictitious events, as Voltaire has done in his account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Fontenoy, he loses his credit with us, by raising a suspicion that he is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> upon a pretty story than upon the truth. And we are disgusted with his insincerity, when, in defiance even of verisimilitude, he puts long elaborate orations in the mouth of those, of whom we know, either from the circumstances that they could not, or from more authentic records that they did not, make any such orations; as Dionysius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALICARNASSUS\">Halicarnassus</a> has done in the case of Volumnia haranguing her son Coriolanus, and Flavius Josephus in that of Judah addressing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> as viceroy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. From what these historians relate, one would conjecture\n\n(B) Fielding's Tom Jones, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMELIA\">Amelia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Andrews, are examples of what may be called the Epic or Narrative Comedy, or more properly perhaps the Comic Epopee.\nOf Nature conjecture that the Roman matron had studied at Athens under some long-winded rhetorician, and that the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> must have been one of the most flowery orators of antiquity. But the fictitious part of history, or of story-telling, ought never to take up much room; and must be highly blameable when it leads into any mistake either of facts or of characters.\n\nNow, why do historians take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to embellish their works in this manner? One reason, no doubt, is, that they may display their talents in oratory and narration; but the chief reason, as hinted already, is, to render their composition more agreeable. It would seem, then, that something more pleasing than real nature, or something which shall add to the pleasing qualities of real nature, may be devised by human fancy. And this may certainly be done. And this it is the poet's business to do. And when this is in any degree done by the historian, his narrative becomes in that degree poetical.\n\nThe possibility of thus improving upon nature must be obvious to every one. When we look at a landscape, we can fancy a thousand additional embellishments. Mountains lovelier and more picturesque; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> more copious, more limpid, and more beautifully winding; smoother and wider lawns; valleys more richly diversified; caverns and rocks more gloomy and more stupendous; ruins more majestic; buildings more magnificent; oceans more varied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, more splendid with shipping, or more agitated by storms, than any we have ever seen\u2014it is easy for human imagination to conceive. Many things in art and nature exceed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>; but nothing sensible transcends or equals the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of thought\u2014a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the human soul! The finest woman in the world appears to every eye susceptible of improvement, except perhaps to that of her lover. No wonder, then, if in poetry events can be exhibited more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and of more pleasing variety, than those delineated by the historian, and scenes of inanimate nature more dreadful or more lovely, and human characters more sublime and more exquisite, both in good and evil. Yet still let nature supply the groundwork and materials, as well as the standard, of poetical fiction. The most expert painters use a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYMAN\">layman</a>, or other visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, to direct their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and regulate their fancy. Homer himself founds his two poems on authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>; and tragic as well epic poets have followed the example. The writers of romance, too, are ambitious to interweave true adventures with their fables; and when it can be conveniently done, to take the outlines of their plan from real life. Thus the tale of Robinson Crusoe is founded on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> that actually befell one Alexander Selkirk, a seafaring man, who lived several years alone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Juan Fernandez: Smollet is thought to have given us several of his own adventures in the history of Roderic Random; and the chief characters in Tom Jones, Joseph Andrews, and Pamela, are said to have been copied from real originals. Dramatic comedy, indeed, is for the most part purely fictitious: for if it were to exhibit real events as well as present manners, it would become too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> to be endured by a well-bred audience, and degenerate into downright abuse; which appears to have been the case with the old comedy of the Greeks*. But in general, hints taken from real existence will be found to give no little grace and stability to fiction, even in the most fanciful poems. These hints, however, may be improved by the poet's imagination, and let off with every probable ornament that can be devised, confitently with the design and genius of the work; or in other words, with the sympathies that the poet means to awaken in the mind of his reader. For mere poetical ornament, when it fails to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> the affections, is not only useless, but improper; all true poetry being addressed to the heart, and intended to give pleasure by raising or soothing the passions\u2014the only effectual way of pleasing a rational and moral creature. And therefore we would take Horace's maxim to be universal in poetry:** \"Non satis est pulchra effe poema; dulcia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNTO\">junto</a>.\"*** \"It is not enough that poems be beautiful; let them also be affecting.\"****\n\nFor that this is the meaning of the word dulcia in this place, is admitted by the best interpreters, and is indeed evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a>.*****\n\nThat the sentiments and feelings of perceiving beings and when expressed in poetry, should call forth our affections, is natural enough; but can descriptions of inanimate things also be made affecting? certainly they can; as to the more they affect, the more they please us, and make them the more poetical we allow them to be. Virgil's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GEORGIC\">Georgic</a> is a noble specimen (and indeed the noblest in the world) of this sort of poetry. His admiration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> nature gains upon a reader of taste, till it rise to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> enthusiasm. The following observations will perhaps explain this matter.\n\nEvery thing in nature is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> in itself, and bears innumerable relations to other things; and may therefore be viewed in an endless variety of lights, and consequently described in an endless variety of ways. Some descriptions are good, and others bad. An historical description, that enumerates all the qualities of any object, is certainly good, because it is true; but may be as uninteresting as a logical definition. In poetry, no uninteresting description is good however conformable to truth: for here we expect not a complete enumeration of qualities (the chief end of the art being to please), but only such an enumeration as may give a lively and interesting idea. It is not memory, or the knowledge of rules, that can qualify a poet for this sort of description; but a peculiar liveliness of fancy and sensibility of heart, the nature whereof we may explain by its effects, but we cannot lay down rules for the attainment of it.\n\nWhen our mind is occupied by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, we naturally use words and meditate on things that are suitable to it and tend to encourage it. If a man were to write a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> when he is very angry, there would probably be something of vehemence or bitterness in the style, even though the person to whom he wrote were not the object of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>. The same thing holds true of every other strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> or emotion:\u2014while it predominates in the mind, it gives a peculiarity to our thoughts, as well as to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, gesture, and countenance: And hence we expect, that every performance introduced in poetry should see things through the medium of his ruling passion, and that his thoughts and language should be tinged accordingly. A melancholy man walking in a grove, attends to those things that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> and encourage his melancholy; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGHING\">sighing</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> in the trees, the murmuring of waters, the murmuring of darknes and solitude of the shades: A cheerful man in a garden...\nOf Nature the same place, finds many subjects of cheerful meditations, in the fingering of birds, the brisk motions of the babbling stream, and the liveliness and variety of the verdure. Persons of different characters, contemplating the same thing, a Roman triumph, for instance, feel different emotions, and turn their view to different objects. One is filled with wonder at such a display of wealth and power; another exults in the idea of conquest, and pants for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> renown; a third, stung with clamour, and harried with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a>, wishes for silence, security, and solitude; one melts with pity to the vanquished, and makes many a sad reflection upon the insignificance of worldly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, and the uncertainty of human things; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUFFOON\">buffoon</a>, and perhaps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, considers the whole as a vain piece of pageantry, which, by its solemn procedure, and by the admiration of so many people, is only rendered the more ridiculous;\u2014and each of these persons would describe it in a way suitable to his own feelings, and tending to raise the same in others. We see in Milton's Allegro and Penorolo, how a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of mind produces a variety in the manner of conceiving and contemplating the same rural scenery. In the former of these excellent poems, the author personates a cheerful man, and takes notice of those things in external nature that are suitable to cheerful thoughts, and tend to encourage them: in the latter, every object described is serious and solemn, and productive of calm reflection and tender melancholy; and we should not be easily persuaded, that Milton wrote the first under the influence of sorrow, or the second under that of gladness. We often see an author's character in his works; and if every author were in earnest when he writes, we should oftener see it. Thomson was a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, and a warm admirer of the beauties of nature; and every description in his delightful poem on the Seasons tends to raise the same laudable affections in his reader. The parts of nature that attract his notice are those which an impious or hard-hearted man would neither attend to, nor be affected with, at least in the same manner. In Swift we see a turn of mind very different from that of the amiable Thomson; little relish for the sublime or beautiful, and a perpetual succession of violent emotions. All his pictures of human life seem to show, that deformity and meanness were the favourite objects of his attention, and that his soul was a constant prey to indignation (c), disgust, and other gloomy passions, arising from such a view of things. And it is the tendency of almost all his writings (though it was not always the author's design), to communicate the same passions to his reader: inasmuch, that notwithstanding his erudition and knowledge of the world, his abilities as a popular orator and man of bufonics, the energy of his style, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of some of his verses, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> talents in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, there is reason to doubt, whether by studying his works any person was very much improved in piety or benevolence.\n\nAnd thus we see, how the compositions of an ingenious author may operate upon the heart, whatever be the subject. The affections that prevail in the author of Nature himself, direct his attention to objects congenial, and give a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a> to his inventive powers, and a peculiar colour to his language. Hence his work, as well as face, if nature is permitted to exert herself freely in it, will that poetry exhibit a picture of his mind, and awaken correspondent affections in the reader. When these are favourable to virtue, which they always ought to be, the work will have that sweet pathos to which Horace alludes in the passage above mentioned; and which we so highly admire, and so warmly approve, even in those parts of the Georgic that describe inanimate nature.\n\nHorace's account of the matter in question differs not from what is here given. \"It is not enough (says he) *Ar. Poet. that poems be beautiful; let them be affecting, and v.99\u2014111 agitate the mind with whatever passions the poet wishes to impart. The human countenance, as it smiles on those who smile, accompanies also with sympathetic tears those who mourn. If you would have me weep, you must first weep yourself; then, and not before, shall I be touched with your misfortunes.\u2014For nature first makes the emotions of our mind correspond with our circumstances, infusing real joy, sorrow, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, according to the occasion; and afterwards gives the true pathetic utterance to the voice and language.\" This doctrine, which concerns the orator and the player no less than the poet, is strictly philosophical, and equally applicable to dramatic, to descriptive, and indeed to every species of interesting poetry. The poet's sensibility must first of all engage him warmly in his subject, and in every part of it; otherwise he will labour in vain to interest the reader. If he would paint external nature, as Virgil and Thomson have done, so as to make her amiable to others, he must first be enamoured of her himself; if he would have his heroes and heroines speak the language of love or sorrow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> or courage, ambition or anger, benevolence or pity, his heart must be susceptible of those emotions, and in some degree feel them, as long at least as he employs himself in framing words for them; being assured, that\n\nHe best shall paint them who can feel them most.\n\nPope's Eloisa, v. 366.\n\nThe true poet, therefore, must not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> nature, and know the reality of things, but must also possess fancy, to invent additional decorations; judgment, to direct him in the choice of such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with verisimilitude; and sensibility, to enter with ardent emotions into every part of his subject, so as to transmute into every part of his work a pathos and energy sufficient to raise corresponding emotions in the reader.\n\n\"The historian and the poet (says Aristotle *) differ in this, that the former exhibits things as they are, i.e., in that state of perfection which is consistent with probability, and in which, for the sake of our own gratification, we wish to find them. If the poet, after all the liberties he is allowed to take with the truth, can produce nothing more exquisite than is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> to be met with in history, his reader\n\n(c) For part of this remark we have his own authority, often in his letters, and very explicitly in the Latin epitaph which he composed for himself:\u2014\"ubi sev\u00e6 indignatio ulterius cor lacere nequit.\" See his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> will and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">testament</a>.\nOf Nature reader will be disappointed and dissatisfied. Poetical representations must therefore be framed after a pattern of the highest probable perfection that the genius of the work will admit;\u2014external nature must in them be more picturesque than in reality; action more animated; sentiments more expressive of the feelings and character, and more suitable to the circumstances of the speaker; personages better accomplished in those qualities that raise admiration, pity, terror, and other ardent emotions; and events more compact, more clearly connected with causes and consequences, and unfolded in an order more flattering to the fancy, and more interesting to the passions. But where, it may be said, is this pattern of perfection to be found? Not in real nature; otherwise history, which delineates real nature, would also delineate this pattern of perfection. It is to be found only in the mind of the poet; and it is imagination, regulated by knowledge, that enables him to form it.\n\nIn the beginning of life, and while experience is confined to a small circle, we admire every thing, and are pleased with very moderate excellence. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> thinks the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of his landlord the finest apartment in the universe, listens with rapture to the strutting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAD\">ballad</a>-finger, and wonders at the rude wooden cuts that adorn his ruder compositions. A child looks upon his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>; upon the brook that runs by as a river; and upon the meadows and hills in the neighborhood as the most spacious and beautiful that can be. But when, after long absence, he returns in his declining years, to visit once before he die, the dear spot that gave him birth, and those scenes whereof he remembers rather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> charms than the exact proportions; how is he disappointed to find every thing so debased and so diminished! The hills seem to have sunk into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the brook to be dried up, and the village to be forsaken of its people; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, stripped of all its fancied magnificence, is become low, gloomy, and narrow; and the fields are now only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a> of what they were. Had he never left this spot, his notions might have remained the same as at first; and had he travelled but a little way from it, they would not perhaps have received any material enlargement. It seems then to be from observation of many things of the same or similar kinds, that we acquire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of forming ideas more perfect than the real objects that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> immediately around us; and these ideas we may improve gradually more and more, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> fancy, vivacity of our mind, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of our experience, till at last we come to raise them to a degree of perfection superior to anything to be found in real life. There cannot be any mystery in this doctrine; for we think and speak to the same purpose every day. Thus nothing is more common than to say, that each an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> excels all we have ever known in his profession, and yet that we can still conceive a superior performance. A morality, by bringing together into one view the separate virtues of many persons, is enabled to lay down a system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> more perfect than any he has ever seen exemplified in human conduct. Whatever be the emotion the poet intends to raise in his reader, whether admiration or terror, joy or sorrow; and whatever be the object he would exhibit, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> or Tityphone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a>, a palace or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of ruins, a dance or a battle; he generally copies an idea of his own imagination; considering each quality as it is found to exist in several individuals of a species, and hence forming an assemblage more or less perfect in its kind, according to the purpose to which he means to apply it.\n\nHence it would appear, that the ideas of poetry are poetical rather general than singular; rather collected from the examination of a species or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of things, than copied from an individual. And this, according to Aristotle, is in fact the case, at least for the most part; whence that critic determines, that poetry is something more exquisite and more philosophical than history. The historian may describe Bucephalus, but the poet delineates a war-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; the former must have seen the animal he speaks of, or received authentic information concerning it, if he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to describe it historically; for the latter, it is enough that he has seen several animals of that sort. The former tells us, what Achilles actually did and said; the latter, what such a species of human character as that which bears the name of Achilles would probably do or say in certain given circumstances.\n\nIt is indeed true, that the poet may, and often does, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> after individual objects. Homer, no doubt, took his characters from the life; or at least, in forming them, was careful to follow tradition as far as the nature of his plan would allow. But he probably took the freedom to add or heighten some qualities, and take away others; to make Achilles, for example, stronger, perhaps, and more impetuous, and more eminent for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> affection, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HECTOR\">Hector</a> more patriotic and more amiable than he really was. If he had not done this, or something like it, his work would have been rather a history than a poem; would have exhibited men and things as they were, and not as they might have been; and Achilles and Hector would have been the names of individual and real heroes; whereas, according to Aristotle, they are rather to be considered as two distinct modifications or species of the heroic character. Shakespeare's account of the cliffs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> comes so near the truth, that we cannot doubt of its having been written by one who had seen them; but he who takes it for an exact historical description, will be surprised when he comes to the place, and finds those cliffs not half so lofty as the poet had made him believe. An historian would be to blame for such amplification; because, being to describe an individual precipice, he ought to tell us just what it is; which if he did, the description would suit that place, and perhaps no other in the whole world. But the poet means only to give an idea of what such a precipice may be; and therefore his description may perhaps be equally applicable to many such chalky precipices on the sea-shore.\n\nThis method of copying after general ideas formed by the artist from observation of many individuals, distinguishes the Italian and all the sublime painters, from the Dutch and their imitators. These give us bare nature, with the imperfections and peculiarities of individual things or persons; but those give nature improved as far as probability and the design of the piece will admit. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENIERS\">Teniers</a> and Hogarth draw faces, and figures, and dresses, from real life, and present manners; and therefore their pieces must in some degree lose the effect, and become awkward, when the prevalent fashions become obsolete.\u2014Raphael and Reynolds take their models from general nature; avoiding as far\nOf Nature far as possible, (at least in all their great performances), those peculiarities that derive their beauty from mere fashion; and therefore their works must give pleasure, and appear elegant, as long as men are capable of forming general ideas, and of judging from them. The last-mentioned incomparable artist is particularly observant of children, whose looks and attitudes, being left under the control of art and local manners, are more characteristic of the species than those of men and women. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of observation has supplied him with many fine figures, particularly that most exquisite one of Comedy, struggling for and winning (for who could resist her!) the affections of Garrick\u2014a figure which could never have occurred to the imagination of a painter who had confined his views to grown persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> and moving in all the formality of polite life\u2014a figure which in all ages and countries would be pronounced natural and engaging; whereas those human forms that we see every day bowing and courting, and strutting, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> out their toes secundum artem, and drested in ruffles, and wigs, and flounces, and hoop-petticoats, and full-trimmed suits, would appear elegant no further than the present fashions are propagated, and no longer than they remain unaltered.\n\nThere is, in the progress of human society, as well as of human life, a period to which it is of great importance for the higher order of poets to attend, and from which they will do well to take their characters, and manners, and the era of their events; namely, that wherein men are raised above savage life, and considerably improved by arts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>; but not advanced so high in the affect towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, as to have acquired a habit of disguising their thoughts and passions, and of reducing their behaviour to the uniformity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>. Such was the period which Homer had the good fortune (as a poet) to live in, and to celebrate. This is the period at which the manners of men are most picturesque, and their adventures most romantic. This is the period when the appetites unperverted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, the powers unnervated by effeminacy, and the thoughts disengaged from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> restraint, will, in persons of similar dispositions and circumstances, operate in nearly the same way; and when, consequently, the characters of particular men will approach to the nature of poetical or general ideas, and, if well imitated, give pleasure to the whole, or at least to a great majority of mankind. But a character tinctured with the fashions of polite life would not be so generally interesting. Like a human figure adjusted by a modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, and drested by a modern tailor, it may have a good effect in satire, comedy, or farce: but if introduced into the higher poetry, it would be admired by those only who had learned to admire nothing but present fashions, and by them no longer than the present fashions lasted; and to all the rest of the world would appear awkward, unaffected, and perhaps ridiculous. But Achilles and Sarpedon, Diomede and Hector, Neftor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULYSSES\">Ulysses</a>, as drawn by Homer, must in all ages, independently on fashion, command the attention and admiration of mankind. These have the qualities that are universally known to belong to human nature; whereas the modern fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> is distinguished by qualities that belong only to a particular age, society, and corner of the world. We speak not of moral or intellectual virtues, which are objects of admiration to every age; but of those outward accomplishments, and that particular temperature of the passions, which form the most perceptible part of a human character.\u2014As, therefore, the politician, in discoursing the rights of mankind, must often allude to an imaginary state of nature; so the poet who intends to raise admiration, pity, terror, and other important emotions, in the generality of mankind, especially in those readers whose minds are most improved, must take his pictures of life and manners, rather from the heroic period we now speak of, than from the ages of refinement; and must therefore (to repeat the maxim of Aristotle) \"exhibit things, not as they are, but as they might be.\"\n\nSect. IV. Of Poetical Characters.\n\nHorace seems to think, that a competent knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> will fit an author for afflicting the delineation of the suitable qualities and duties to each poetical personage: (Art. Poet. v. 359.\u2014316.) The maxim may be true, as far as mere morality is the aim of the poet; but cannot be understood to refer to the delineation of poetical characters in general: for a thorough acquaintance with all the moral philosophy in the world would not have enabled Blackmore to paint such a personage as Homer's Achilles, Shakespeare's Othello, or the Satan of Paradise Lost. To a competency of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, there must be added an extensive knowledge of mankind, a warm and elevated imagination, and the greatest sensibility of heart, before a genius can be formed equal to so difficult a task. Horace is indeed sensible of the danger of introducing a new character in poetry, that he even discourages the attempt, and advises the poet rather to take his person from the ancient authors, or from tradition: Ibid. v. 119.\u2014139.\n\nTo conceive the idea of a good man, and to invent and support a great poetical character, are two very different things, however they may seem to have been confounded by some late critics. The first is easy to any person sufficiently instructed in the duties of life: the last is perhaps of all the efforts of human genius the most difficult; so very difficult, that though attempted by many, Homer, Shakespeare, and Milton, are almost the only authors who have succeeded in it. But characters of perfect virtue are not the most proper for poetry. It seems to be agreed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> should not be introduced in the machinery of a poetical fable. To ascribe to him words and actions of our own invention, seems very unbecoming; nor can a poetical description, that is known to be, and must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> be, infinitely inadequate, ever satisfy the human mind. Poetry, according to the best critics, which is an imitation of human action; and therefore poetical characters, though elevated, should fill partake of the passions and frailties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. If it were not for the vices of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> personages, the Iliad facilities of would not be either so interesting or so moral: the humanity; most moving and most eventful parts of the \u00c6neid are those that describe the effects of unlawful passion\u2014the most instructive tragedy in the world, we mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a>, is founded in crimes of dreadful enormity:\u2014and if Milton had not taken into his plan the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of our first parents, as well as their state of innocence,\nOf poetical his divine poem must have wanted much of its pathos, and could not have been (what it now is) such a treasure of important knowledge, as no other uninspired writer ever comprehended in so small a compass.\n\nVirtue, like truth, is uniform and unchangeable. We may anticipate the part a good man will act in any given circumstances; and therefore the events that depend on such a man must be less surprising than those which proceed from passion; the vicissitudes whereof it is frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to foresee. From the violent temper of Achilles, in the Iliad, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> many great incidents; which could not have taken place, if he had been calm and prudent like Ulysses, or pious and patriotic like Eneas: his rejection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGAMEMNON\">Agamemnon</a>'s offers, in the ninth book, arises from the violence of his resentment\u2014his yielding to the request of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATROCLUS\">Patroclus</a>, in the 16th, from the violence of his friendship (if we may so speak) counteracting his resentment; and his restoring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIAM\">Priam</a> the dead body of Hector, in the 24th, from the violence of his affection to his own aged father, and his regard to the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, counteracting, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, both his sorrow for his friend, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> for vengeance.\u2014Besides, except where there is some degree of vice, it pains us too exquisitely to see misfortune; and therefore poetry would cease to have a pleasurable influence over our tender passions, if it were to exhibit virtuous characters only. And as in life, evil is necessary to our moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBATION\">probation</a>, and the possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> to our intellectual improvement; so bad or mixed characters are useful in poetry, to give to the good such opposition, as puts them upon displaying and exercising their virtue.\n\nAll those personages, however, in whose fortune the poet means that we should be interested, must have agreeable and admirable qualities to recommend them to our regard. And perhaps the greatest difficulty in the art lies in suitably blending those faults which the poet finds it expedient to give to any particular hero, with such moral, intellectual, or corporeal accomplishments, as may engage our esteem, pity, or admiration, without weakening our hatred of vice, or love of virtue. In most of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOVELS\">novels</a>, and in many of our plays, it happens unluckily, that the hero of the piece is so captivating, as to incline us to be indulgent to every part of his character, the bad as well as the good. But a great master knows how to give the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to human sensibility; and, without any perversion of our faculties, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of right and wrong, to make the same person the object of very different emotions, of pity and hatred, of admiration and horror. Who does not esteem and admire Macbeth for his courage and generosity? who does not pity him when beset with all the terrors of a pregnant imagination, superstitious temper, and awakened conscience? who does not abhor him as a monster of cruelty, treachery, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>? His good qualities, by drawing us near to him, make us, as it were, eye-witnesses of his crime, and give us a fellow-feeling of his remorse; and therefore, his example cannot fail to have a powerful effect in cherishing our love of virtue, and fortifying our minds against criminal impositions; whereas, had he wanted those good qualities, we should have kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALOOF\">aloof</a> from his concerns, or viewed them with a superficial attention; in which case his example would have had little more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> than that of the robber, of whom we know nothing, but that he was tried, condemned, and executed.\u2014Satan, in Paradise Lost, is a character drawn and supported with the most consummate judgement. The old furies and demons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HECATE\">Hecate</a>, Tiphon, Alecto, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEGARA\">Megara</a>, are objects of unmixed and unmitigated abhorrence; Titus, Enceladus, and their brethren, are remarkable for nothing but impiety, deformity, and vastness of size; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTO\">Pluto</a> is, at best, an insipid personage; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-brained ruffian; Tasso's infernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, an ugly and overgrown monster\u2014but in the Miltonic Satan, we are forced to admire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> of the ruined archangel, at the same time that we detest the unconquerable depravity of the fiend. \"But, of all poetical characters, (says the elegant critic from whom we are extracting), the Achilles of Homer (D) seems to me the most exquisite of invention, and the most highly finished. The utility of this character in a moral view is obvious; for it may be considered as the source of all the morality of the Iliad. Had not the generous and violent temper of Achilles determined him to patronize the augur Calchas in defiance of Agamemnon, and afterwards, on being affronted by that vindictive commander, to abandon for a time the common cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>\u2014the fatal effects of dissension among confederates, and of capricious and tyrannical behaviour in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, would not have been the leading moral of Homer's poetry; nor could Hector, Sarpedon, Eneas, Ulysses, and the other amiable heroes, have been brought forward to signalize their virtues, and to recommend themselves to the esteem and imitation of mankind.\n\n\"They who form their judgment of Achilles from the imperfect sketch given of him by Horace in the Ars Poetica, (v. 121, 122.) and consider him only as a hateful composition of anger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, fierceness, obstinacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, can never enter into the views of Ho-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MER\">mer</a>, nor be suitably affected with his narration. All these vices are no doubt, in some degree, combined in Achilles; but they are tempered with qualities of a different sort, which render him a most interesting character, and of course make the Iliad a most interesting poem. Every reader abhors the faults of this hero; and yet, to an attentive reader of Homer, this hero must be the object of esteem, admiration, and pity; for he has many good as well as bad affections, and is equally\n\n(D) \"I say the Achilles of Homer. Later authors have degraded the character of this hero, by supposing every part of his body invulnerable except the heel. I know not how often I have heard this urged as one of Homer's absurdities; and indeed the whole Iliad is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> absurdity, on this supposition. But Homer all along makes his hero equally liable to wounds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> with other men. Nay, to prevent all mistakes in regard to this matter, (if those who cavil at the poet would but read his work), he actually wounds him in the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a> of Asteropoeus, in the battle near the river Scamander.\" See Iliad, xxii. verse 161\u2014168.\nviolent in all:\u2014Nor is he possessed of a single vice or virtue, which the wonderful art of the poet has not made subservient to the design of the poem, and to the progress and catastrophe of the action; so that the hero of the Iliad, considered as a poetical personage, is just what he should be, neither greater nor less, neither worse nor better.\u2014He is everywhere distinguished by an abhorrence of oppression, by a liberal and elevated mind, by a passion for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and by a love of truth, freedom, and sincerity. He is for the most part attentive to the duties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; and, except to those who have injured him, courteous and kind: he is affectionate to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> Phoenix; and not only pities the misfortunes of his enemy Priam, but in the most soothing manner administers to him the best consolation that Homer's poor theology could furnish. Though no admirer of the cause in which his evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a> compels him to engage, he is warmly attached to his native land; and, ardent as he is in vengeance, he is equally so in love to his aged father <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PELEUS\">Peleus</a>, and to his friend Patroclus. He is not luxurious like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, or clownish like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AJAX\">Ajax</a>; his accomplishments are princely, and his amusements worthy of a hero. Add to this, as an apology for the vehemence of his anger, that the affront he had received was (according to the manners of that age) of the most atrocious nature; and not only unprovoked, but such as, on the part of Agamemnon, betrayed a brutal insensibility to merit, as well as a proud, selfish, ungrateful, and tyrannical disposition. And though he is often inexcusably furious; yet it is but justice to remark, that he was not naturally cruel (E); and that his wildest outrages were such as in those rude times might be expected from a violent man of invincible strength and valour, when exasperated by injury, and frantic with sorrow.\u2014Our hero's claim to the admiration of mankind is indisputable. Every part of his character is sublime and astonishing. In his person, he is the strongest, the swiftest, the most beautiful of men:\u2014this last circumstance, however, occurs not to his own observation, being too trivial to attract the notice of so great a mind. The Fates had put it in his power, either to return home before the end of the war, or to remain at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>:\u2014if he chose the former, he would enjoy tranquillity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> in his own country to a good old age; if the latter, he must perish in the bloom of his youth:\u2014his affection to his father and native country, and his hatred to Agamemnon, strongly urged him to the first; but a desire to avenge the death of his friend determines him to accept the last, with all its consequences. This at once displays the greatness of his fortitude, the warmth of his friendship, and the violence of his sanguinary passions: and it is this that so often and so powerfully recommends him to the pity, as well as admiration, of the attentive reader.\"\n\nIt is equally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of rich invention and exact judgement in Homer, that he mixes some good qualities in all his bad characters, and some degree of imperfection in almost all his good ones.\u2014Agamemnon, notwithstanding his pride, is an able general, and a valiant man, and highly esteemed as such by the greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>.\u2014Paris, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a>, and vain of his dress and person, is, however, good-natured, patient of reproach, not destitute of courage, and eminently skilled in music and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>.\u2014Ajax is a huge giant; fearless rather from insensibility to danger, and confidence in his mighty arms, than from any nobler principle; boastful and rough; regardless of the gods, though not downright impious: yet there is in his manner something of frankness and blunt sincerity, which entitle him to a place in our esteem; and he is ever ready to assist his countrymen, to whom he renders good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> on many a perilous emergency.\u2014The character of Helen, in spite of her faults, and of the many calamities whereof she is the guilty cause, Homer has found means to recommend to our pity, and almost to our love; and this he does, without seeking to extenuate the crime of Paris, of which the most respectable personages in the poem are made to speak with becoming abhorrence. She is so full of remorse, so ready on every occasion to condemn her past conduct, so affectionate to her friends, so willing to do justice to every body's merit, and withal so finely accomplished, that she extorts our admiration, as well as that of the Trojan senators.\u2014Menelaus, though sufficiently sensible of the injury he had received, is yet a man of moderation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>, and good-nature, a valiant soldier, and a most affectionate brother: but there is a dash of vanity in his composition, and he entertains rather too high an opinion of his own abilities, yet never overlooks nor undervalues the merit of others.\u2014Priam would claim unreserved esteem, as well as pity, if it were not for his inexcusable weaknesses, in gratifying the humour, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> abetting the crimes, of the most worthless of all his children, to the utter ruin of his people, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Madame Dacier supposes, that he had lost his authority, and was obliged to fall in with the politics of the times: but of this there appears no evidence; on the contrary, he and his unworthy favourite Paris seem to have been the only persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> in Troy who were adverse to the restoring of Helen. Priam's foible (if it can be called by so soft a name), however faulty, is not uncommon, and has often produced calamity both in private and public life. The Scripture gives a memorable instance in the history of the good old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELI\">Eli</a>.\u2014Sarpedon comes nearer a perfect character than any other of Homer's heroes; but the part he has to act is short. It is a character which one could hardly have expected in those rude times: a sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, who considers himself as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> set up by the people for the public good, and therefore bound in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to be himself their example, and study to excel as much in virtue as in rank and authority.\u2014Hector is the favourite of every reader, and with good reason. To the truest valour he joins the most generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>. He abominates the crime of Paris: but not being able to prevent the war, he thinks it his duty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> his country, and his father and sovereign, to the last. He too, as well as Achilles, foresees his\n\n(E) See Iliad xxi. 100, and xxiv. 485\u2014673.\u2014In the first of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, Achilles himself declares, that before Patroclus was slain, he often spared the lives of his enemies, and took pleasure in doing it. It is strange, as Dr Beatie observes, that this should be left out in Pope's Translation.\nOf poetical his own death; which heightens our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>, and\nraises our idea of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>. In all the relations\nof private life, as a son, a father, a husband, a brother,\nhe is amiable in the highest degree; and he is distin-\nguished among all the heroes for tenderness of affection,\ngentleness of manners, and a pious regard to the duties\nof religion. One circumstance of his character, strongly\nexpressive of a great and delicate mind, we learn\nfrom Helen's lamentation over his dead body, that he\nwas almost the only person in Troy who had always\ntreated her with kindness, and never uttered one reproachful word to give her pain, nor heard others reproach her without blaming them for it. Some tendency to ostentation (which, however, may be pardonable in a commander in chief), and temporary fits of timidity, are the only blemishes discoverable in this hero; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> Homer appears to have drawn with an affectionate and peculiar attention.\n\nBy ascribing so many amiable qualities to Hector and some others of the Trojans, the poet interests us in the fate of that people, notwithstanding our being continually kept in mind that they are the injurious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>. And by thus blending good and evil, virtue and frailty, in the composition of his characters, he makes them the more conformable to the real appearances of human nature, and more useful as examples for our improvement; and at the same time, without hurting verisimilitude, gives every necessary embellishment to particular parts of his poem, and variety, coherence, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>, to the whole fable. And it may also be observed, that though several of his characters are complex, not one of them is made up of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> parts; all are natural and probable, and such as we think we have met with, or might have met with, in our intercourse with mankind.\n\nFrom the same extensive views of good and evil, in all their forms and combinations, Homer has been enabled to make each of his characters perfectly distinct in itself, and different from all the rest; inasmuch, that before we come to the end of the Iliad, we are as well acquainted with his heroes, as with the faces and tempers of our most familiar friends. Virgil, by confining himself to a few general ideas of fidelity and fortitude, has made his subordinate heroes a very good sort of people; but they are all the same, and we have no clear knowledge of any one of them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHATES\">Achates</a> is faithful, and Gyas is brave, and Cloanthus is brave; and this is all we can say of the matter. We see these heroes at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, and have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of their shape and size; but are not near enough to distinguish their features; and every face seems to exhibit the same faint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> appearance. But of Homer's heroes we know every particular that can be known. We eat, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>, and talk, and fight, with them; we see them in action and out of it; in the field and in their tents and housetops; the very face of the country about Troy we seem to be as well acquainted with as if we had been there. Similar characters there are among these heroes, as there are similar faces in every society; but we never mistake one for another. Neoptolemus and Ulysses are both wise and both eloquent; but the wisdom of the former seems to be the effect of experience; that of the latter of genius: the eloquence of the one is sweet and copious, but not always to the purpose, and apt to degenerate into story-telling; that of the other is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, emphatic, and persuaive, and accompanied with a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and of poetical simplicity of manner. Homer's heroes are all valiant; yet each displays a modification of valour peculiar to himself; one is valiant from principle, another from constitution; one is rash, another cautious; one is impetuous and headstrong, another impetuous, but tractable; one is cruel, another merciful; one is insolent and often-tatious, another gentle and unassuming; one is vain of his person, another of his strength, and a third of his family.\u2014It would be tedious to give a complete enumeration. Almost every species of the heroic character is to be found in Homer.\n\nOf the agents in Paradise Lost, it has been observed* that \"the weakest are the highest and noblest of human beings, the original parents of mankind; with whose actions the elements consented; on whose rectitude or deviation of will depended the state of terrestrial nature, and the condition of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> inhabitants of the globe. Of the other agents in the poem, the chief are such as it is irreverence to name on flight occasions: the rest are lower powers;\n\n\u2014Of which the least could wield\nThese elements, and arm him with the force\nOf all their regions:\n\nPowers, which only the control of Omnipotence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\nstrains from laying creation waste, and filling the vast drawing\nexpanses of space with ruin and confusion. To display and distri-\nbute the motives and actions of beings thus superior, so far as minuting\nhuman reason can examine, or human imagination re-\npresent them, is the task which Milton undertook and racters in\nperformed. The characters in the Paradise Lost, which Paradise\nadmit of examination, are those of angels and of men:\nof angels good and evil; of man in his innocent and\nsinful state.\n\n\"Among the angels, the virtue of Raphael is mild and\nplacid, of easy condescension, and free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>:\nthat of Michael is regal and lofty, attentive to the dig-\nnity of his own nature. Abdiel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GABRIEL\">Gabriel</a> appear oc-\ncasionally, and act as every incident requires: the foli-\ntary fidelity of Abdiel is very amiably painted.\n\n\"Of the evil angels, the characters are more diver-\nsified. To Satan such sentiments are given as suit the\nmost exalted and most depraved being. Milton has\nbeen censured for the impiety which sometimes breaks\nfrom Satan's mouth; for there are thoughts, it is justly\nremarked, which no observation of character can justify;\nbecause no good man would willingly permit them to\npass, however transiently, through his mind. This cen-\nsure has been thrown to be groundless by the great critic\nfrom whom we quote. To make Satan speak as a rebel,\nsays he, without any such expressions as might taint the\nreader's imagination, was indeed one of the great diffi-\nculties in Milton's undertaking; and I cannot but think\nthat he has extricated himself with great happiness.\nThere is in Satan's speeches little that can give pain to Milton's\npious ear. The language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> cannot be the succe\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> with that of obedience: the malignity of Satan's\nfoams in haughtiness and obstinacy; but his expressions\nare commonly general, and no otherwise offensive than\nas they are wicked.\u2014The other chiefs of the celestial\nrebellion are very judiciously discriminated; and the fe-\nrocious character of Moloch appears, both in the battle\nand in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, with exact consistency.\n\n\"To\u2014\"\n\"To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> and to Eve are given, during their innocence, such sentiments as innocence can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> and utter. Their love is pure benevolence and mutual veneration; their repasts are without luxury, and their diligence without toil. Their addresses to their Maker have little more than the voice of admiration and gratitude: fruition left them nothing to ask, and innocence left them nothing to fear. But with guilt enter distrust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a>, mutual accusations and stubborn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELF_DEFENCE\">self-<a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>: they regard each other with alienated minds, and dread their Creator as the avenger of their transgression; at last, they seek shelter in his mercy, fettered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a>, and melt in supplication. Both before and after the fall, the different sentiments arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> are traced out with inimitable delicacy and philosophical propriety. Adam has always that pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> in dignity, and Eve in loveliness, which we should naturally look for in the father and mother of mankind.\"\n\nFrom what has been said, it seems abundantly evident,\u2014That the end of poetry is to please; and therefore that the most perfect poetry must be the most pleasing;\u2014that what is unnatural cannot give pleasure; and therefore that poetry must be according to nature:\u2014that it must be either according to real nature, or according to nature somewhat different from the reality;\u2014that, if according to real nature, it would give no greater pleasure than history, which is a transcript of real nature;\u2014that greater pleasure is, however, to be expected from it, because we grant it frequent indulgence, in regard to fiction, and the choice of words;\u2014and, consequently, that poetry must be, not according to real nature, but according to nature improved to that degree which is confident with probability and suitable to the poet's purpose.\u2014And hence it is that we call poetry, An imitation of nature.\u2014For that which is properly termed imitation has always in it something which is not in the original. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROTOTYPE\">prototype</a> and transcript be exactly alike; if there be nothing in the one which is not in the other; we may call the latter a representation, a copy, a draught, or a picture, of the former; but we never call it an imitation.\n\nSect. V. Of Arrangement, Unity, Directions.\u2014Further remarks on Nature in Poetry.\n\nI. The origin of nations, and the beginnings of great events, are little known, and seldom interesting; whence the first part of every history, compared with the sequel, is somewhat dry and tedious. But a poet must, even in the beginning of his work, interest the readers, and raise high expectation; not by an affected pomp of style, far less by ample promises or bold professions; but by setting immediately before them some incident, striking enough to raise curiosity, in regard both to its causes and to its consequences. He must therefore take up his story, not at the beginning, but in the middle; or rather, to prevent the work from being too long, as near the end as possible; and afterwards take some proper opportunity to inform us of the preceding events, in the way of narrative, or by conversation of the persons introduced, or by short and natural digressions.\n\nThe action of both the Iliad and Odyssey begins about six weeks before its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>; although the principal events of the war of Troy are to be found in the former; and the adventures of a ten years' voyage, followed by the suppression of a dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> enemy, in the latter. One of the first things mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, is a plague, which Apollo in anger sent into the Grecian army commanded by Agamemnon and now encamped before Troy. Who this Agamemnon was, and who the Grecians were; for what reason they had come hither; how long the siege had lasted; what memorable actions had been already performed; and in what condition both parties now were:\u2014all this, and much more, we soon learn from occasional hints and conversations interspersed through the poem.\n\nIn the Aeneid, which, though it comprehends the transactions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, opens within a few months of the concluding event, we are first presented with a view of the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at sea, and no less a person than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNO\">Juno</a> interesting herself to raise a storm for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. This excites a curiosity to know something further: who these Trojans were, whence they had come, and whither they were bound; why they had left their own country, and what had befell them since they left it. On all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, the poet, without quitting the track of his narrative, soon gives the fullest information: the storm riles; the Trojans are driven to Africa, and hospitably received by the queen of the country; at whose desire their commander relates his adventures.\n\nThe action of Paradise Lost commences not many days before Adam and Eve are expelled from the garden of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDEN\">Eden</a>, which is the concluding event. This poem, as its plan is incomparably more sublime and more important than that of either the Iliad or Aeneid, opens with a far more interesting scene: a multitude of angels and archangels shut up in a region of torment and darkness, and rolling on a lake of unquenchable fire. Who these angels are, and what brought them into this miserable condition, we naturally wish to know; and the poet in due time informs us; partly from the conversation of the bands themselves; and more particularly by the mouth of a happy spirit, sent from heaven to caution the father and mother of mankind against temptation, and confirm their good resolutions by unfolding the dreadful effects of impiety and disobedience.\n\nThis poetical arrangement of events, so different from Beattie, the historical, has other advantages besides those arising ut supra, from brevity and compactness of detail: it is obviously more affecting to the fancy, and more alarming to the passions; and, being more suitable to the order and the poetical manner in which the actions of other men strike our imagination, is a more exact imitation of human affairs. I hear a sudden noise in the street, and run to see what is the matter. An insurrection has happened, a great multitude is brought together, and something very important is going forward. The scene before me is the first thing that engages my attention; and is in itself so interesting, that for a moment or two I look at it in silence and wonder. By and by, when I get time for reflection, I begin to inquire into the cause of all this tumult, and what it is the people would be at; and one who is better informed than I, explains the affair from the beginning; or perhaps I make this out for myself, from the words and actions of the persons principally concerned. This is a sort of picture of poetical arrangement, both in epic and dramatic composition; and this plan\nPart I.\n\nJian has been followed in narrative odes and ballads both ancient and modern.\u2014The historian pursues a different method. He begins perhaps with an account of the manners of a certain age, and of the political constitution of a certain country; then introduces a particular person, gives the story of his birth, connections, private character, pursuits, disappointments, and of the events that promoted his views, and brought him acquainted with other turbulent spirits like himself; and so proceeds, unfolding, according to the order of time, the causes, principles, and progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, if that be the subject which he undertakes to illustrate. It cannot be denied, that this latter method is more favourable to clear information; but the former, compared with it, will be found to have all the advantages already specified, and to be more effectually productive of that mental pleasure which depends on the passions and imagination.\n\nII. If a work have no determinate end, it has no meaning; and if it have many ends, it will distract by its multiplicity. Unity of design, therefore, belongs in some measure to all compositions, whether in verse or prose. But to none is it more essential than to others; and to none so much as in the higher poetry. In certain kinds of history, there is unity sufficient if all the events recorded be referred to one person; in others, if to one period of time, or to one people, or even to the inhabitants of one and the same planet. But it is not enough that the subject of a poetical fable be the exploits of one person; for these may be of various and even of opposite sorts and tendencies, and take up longer time than the nature of poetry can admit:\u2014for less can a regular poem comprehend the affairs of one period or of one people:\u2014it must be limited to one great action or event, to the illustration of which all the subordinate events must contribute; and these must be so connected with one another, as well as with the poet's general purpose, that one cannot be changed, transposed, or taken away, without affecting the confidence and stability of the whole*. In itself an incident may be interesting, a character well drawn, a description beautiful; and yet, if it disfigure the general plan, or if it obstruct or encumber the main action, instead of helping it forward, a correct artist would consider it but as a gaudy superfluity or splendid deformity; like a piece of scarlet cloth sewed upon a garment of a different colour\u2020.\n\nHor. Ars Poet. v. \u00a75. Not that all the parts of the fable either are, or can be, equally essential. Many descriptions and thoughts, of little consequence to the plan, may be admitted for the sake of variety; and the poet may, as well as the historian and philosopher, drop his subject for a time, in order to take up an affecting or instructive digression.\n\nIII. The doctrine of poetical digressions and episodes has been largely treated by the critics. We shall here only remark, that, in estimating their propriety, three things are to be attended to:\u2014their connection with the fable or subject; their own peculiar excellence; and their subordination to the poet's design.\n\n(1.) Those digressions that both arise from and terminate in the subject, like the episode of the angel Raphael in Paradise Lost, and the transition to the death of Caesar and the civil wars in the first book of the Georgics, are the most artful, and if suitably executed claim the highest praise:\u2014those that arise from, but do not terminate in, the subject, are perhaps second in the order of merit; like the story of Dido in the Aeneid, and the encomium on a country life in the second book of the Georgics: those come next that terminate in, but do not rise from, the fable; of which there are several in the third book of the Aeneid, and in the Odyssey:\u2014and those that neither terminate in the fable nor rise from it are the least artful; and if they be long, cannot escape censure, unless their beauty be very great.\n\nBut (2.) we are willing to excuse a beautiful episode at whatever expense to the subject it may be introduced, peculiar excellence, They who can blame Virgil for obtruding upon them and the charming tale of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a> and Euridice in the fourth Georgic, or Milton for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTROPHE\">apostrophe</a> to Light in the beginning of his third book, ought to forfeit all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the peril of good poetry; for of such divine strains one would rather be the author than of all the books of criticism in the world. Yet still it is better that an episode possess the beauty of connection, together with its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> elegance, than this without the other.\n\nMoreover, in judging of the propriety of episodes and their other familiar continuances, it may be expedient to attend to the poet's design, as distinguished from the fable or subject of the poem. The great design, for example, of Virgil, was to interest his countrymen in a poem written with a view to reconcile them to the person and government of Augustus. Whatever, therefore, in the poem tends to promote this design, even though it should in some degree hurt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEXTURE\">contexture</a> of the fable, is really a proof of the poet's judgment; and may be not only allowed, but applauded.\u2014The progress of the action of the Aeneid may seem to be too long obstructed in one place by the story of Dido, which, though it rises from the preceding part of the poem, has no influence upon the sequel; and, in another, by the episode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CACUS\">Cacus</a>, which, without injury to the fable, might have been omitted altogether. Yet these episodes, interesting as they are to us and all mankind because of the transcendent merit of the poetry, must have been still more interesting to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> because of their connection with the Roman affairs; for the one accounts particularly for their wars with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>; and the other not only explains some of their religious ceremonies, but also gives a most charming rural picture of those hills and valleys in the neighbourhood of the Tiber, on which, in after times, their majestic city was fated to stand.\u2014And if we consider, that the design of Homer's Iliad was not only to show the fatal effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> among confederates, but also to immortalize his country, and celebrate the most distinguished families in it, we shall be inclined to think more favourably than critics generally do of some of his long speeches and digressions; which, though to us they may seem trivial, must have been very interesting to his countrymen on account of the genealogies and private history recorded in them.\u2014Shakespeare's historical plays, considered as dramatic fables, and tried by the laws of tragedy and comedy, appear very rude compositions; but if we attend to the poet's design (as the elegant critic has with equal truth and beauty explained it), we shall be forced to admire his judgement in the general conduct of those pieces, as well as unequalled success in the execution of particular parts.\n\nThere is yet another point of view in which these digressions may be considered. If they tend to elucidate any important character, or to introduce any interesting event not otherwise within the compass of the poem, or\nOf poetical to give an amiable display of any particular virtue, they may be intitled, not to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> only, but even to our admiration, however loofely they may hang upon the fable. All these three ends are effected by that most beautiful episode of Hector and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDROMACHE\">Andromache</a> in the fifth book of the Iliad; and the two last, by the no less beautiful one of Euryalus and Nissus in the ninth book of the \u00c6neid.\n\nIV. And now, from the position formerly established, that the end of this divine art is to give pleasure, it has been endeavoured to prove, that, whether in displaying the appearances of the material universe, or in imitating the workings of the human mind, and the varieties of human character, or in arranging and combining into one whole the several incidents and parts whereof his fable consists,\u2014the aim of the poet must be to copy nature, not as it is, but in that state of perfection in which, confluently with the particular genius of the work, and the laws of verisimilitude, it may be supposed to be.\n\nSuch, in general, is the nature of that poetry which is intended to raise admiration, pity, and other serious emotions. But in this art, as in all others, there are different degrees of excellence; and we have hitherto directed our view chiefly to the highest. All serious poets are not equally solicitous to improve nature. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a> is said to have represented men as they were; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHOCLES\">Sophocles</a>, more poetically, as they should or might be. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOCRITUS\">Theocritus</a> in his Idyls, and Spenser in his Shepherd's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">Calendar</a>, give us language and sentiments more nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> those of the Rus verum et barbarum \u00a7, than what we meet with in the Pastorals of Virgil and Pope. In the historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAMA\">drama</a>, human characters and events must be according to historical truth, or at least not so remote from it as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> into any important misapprehension of fact. And in the historical epic poem, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARSALIA\">Pharsalia</a> of Lucan, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">Campaign</a> of Addison, the historical arrangement is preferred to the poetical, as being nearer the truth. Yet nature is a little improved even in these poems. The persons in Shakespeare's historical plays, and the heroes of the Pharsalia, talk in verse, and suitably to their characters, and with a readiness, beauty, and harmony of expression, not to be met with in real life, nor even in history: speeches are invented, and, to heighten the description, circumstances added, with great latitude: real events are rendered more compact and more strictly dependent upon one another; and fictitious ones brought in, to elucidate human characters and diversify the narration.\n\nThe more poetry improves nature, by copying after general ideas collected from extensive observation, the more it partakes (according to Aristotle) of the nature of philosophy; the greater stretch of fancy and of observation it requires in the artist, the better chance it has to be universally agreeable.\n\nYet poetry, when it falls short of this perfection, may have great merit as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of both instruction and pleasure. To most men, simple unadorned nature is, at certain times, and in certain compositions, more agreeable than the most elaborate improvements of art; as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> short period, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODULATION\">modulation</a>, gives a pleasing variety to a discourse. Many such portraits of simple nature there are in the subordinate parts both of Homer's and of Virgil's poetry: and an excellent effect they have in giving probability to the fiction, as well as gratifying the reader's fancy with images distinct and lively, and easily comprehended. The historical plays of Shakespeare raise not our pity and terror to such a height as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAR\">Lear</a>, Macbeth, or Othello; but they interest and instruct us greatly notwithstanding. The rudest of the eclogues of Theocritus, or even of Spenser, have by some authors been extolled above those of Virgil, because more like real life. Nay, Corneille is known to have preferred the Pharsalia to the \u00c6neid, perhaps from its being nearer the truth, or perhaps from the sublime sentiments of stoical morality so forcibly and so offensively displayed in it.\n\nPoets may refine upon nature too much as well as too little; for affectation and rusticity are equally remote from true elegance. The style and sentiments of comedy should no doubt be more correct and more pointed than those of the most polite conversation: but to make every footman a wit, and every gentleman and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> an epigrammatist, as Congreve has done, is an excessive and faulty refinement. The proper medium has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a> and Terence, by Shakespeare in his happier scenes, and by Garrick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, and some others of late renown. To describe the passion of love with as little delicacy as some men speak of it would be unpardonable; but to transform it into mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> is to run into another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, less criminal indeed, but too remote from universal truth to be universally interesting. To the former extreme Ovid inclines, and Petrarch and his imitators to the latter. Virgil has happily avoided both: but Milton has painted this passion as distinct from all others, with such peculiar truth and beauty, that we cannot think Voltaire's encomium too high, when he says, that love in all other poetry seems a weakness, but in Paradise Lost a virtue. There are many good strokes of nature in Ramfay's Gentle Shepherd; but the author's passion for the rus verum betrays him into some indelicacies: a censure that falls with greater weight upon Theocritus, who is often absolutely indecent. The Italian pastoral of Tasso and Guarini, and the French of Fontanelle, run into the opposite extreme (though in some parts beautifully simple), and display a system of rural manners so quaint and affected as to outrage all probability. In fine, though mediocrity of execution in poetry be allowed to deserve the doom pronounced upon it by Horace; yet it is true, notwithstanding, that in this art, as in many other good things, the point of excellence lies in a middle between two extremes; and has been reached by those only who fought to improve nature as far as the genius of their work would permit, keeping at an equal distance from rusticity on the one hand, and affected elegance on the other.\n\nSect. VI. Of Poetical Language.\n\nWords in poetry are chosen, first, for their sense; words in and, secondly, for their sound. That the first of these is necessary to be chosen for grounds of choice is the more excellent nobody can deny. Their sense is a fool. Yet sound is to be attended to even in prose, and in verse demands particular attention. We shall consider poetical language, first, as significant; and, secondly, as susceptible of harmony.\n\u00a7 I. Of Poetical Language considered as SIGNIFICANT.\n\nIf, as it has been endeavoured to prove, poetry be imitative of nature, poetical fictions of real actions, poetical images of real appearances in the visible creation, and poetical personages of real human characters; it would seem to follow, that the language of poetry must be an imitation of the language of nature.\n\nAccording to Dr Beattie *, that language is natural which is suited to the speaker's condition, character, and circumstances. And as, for the most part, the images and sentiments of serious poetry are copied from the images and sentiments, not of real, but of improved, nature; so the language of serious poetry must (as hinted already) be a transcript, not of the real language of nature, which is often dissonant and rude, but of natural language improved as far as may be consistent with probability, and with the supposed character of the speaker.\n\nIf this be not the case, if the language of poetry be such only as we hear in conversation or read in history, it will, instead of delight, bring disappointment: because it will fall short of what we expect from an art which is recommended rather by its pleasurable qualities than by its intrinsic utility; and to which, in order to render it pleasing, we grant higher privileges than to any other kind of literary composition, or any other mode of human language.\n\nThe next inquiry must therefore be, \"What are those improvements that peculiarly belong to the language of poetry?\" And these may be comprehended under two heads; poetical words, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-TROPES\">tropes</a> and figures.\n\nArt. I. Of Poetical Words.\n\nOne mode of improvement peculiar to poetical diction results from the use of those words and phrases which, because they rarely occur in prose, and frequently in verse, are by the grammarians and lexicographers termed poetical. In these some languages abound more than others; but no language perhaps is altogether without them, and perhaps no language can be so in which any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of good poems have been written: for poetry is better remembered than prose, especially by poetical authors, who will always be apt to imitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a> of those they have been accustomed to read and admire; and thus, in the works of poets down through successive generations, certain phrases may have been conveyed, which, though originally perhaps in common use, are now confined to poetical composition. Prose writers are not to apt to imitate one another, at least in words and phrases, both because they do not so well remember one another's phraseology, and also because their language is less artificial, and must not, if they would make it easy and flowing (without which it cannot be elegant), depart essentially from the style of correct conversation.\n\nPoets, too, on account of the greater difficulty of their numbers, have, both in the choice and in the arrangement of words, a better claim to indulgence, and stand more in need of a discretionary power.\n\nThe language of Homer differs materially from what was written and spoken in Greece in the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>. It differs in the mode of inflection, it differs in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNTAX\">syntax</a>, it differs even in the words: so that one might read Homer with ease who could not read <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a>; or Xenophon, without being able to read Homerus. Yet we cannot believe that Homer, or the first Greek poet who wrote in his style, would make choice of a dialect quite different from what was intelligible in his own time: for poets have in all ages written with a view to be read, and to be read with pleasure; which they could not be if their diction were hard to understand. It is more reasonable to suppose that the language of Homer is according to some ancient dialect, which, though not perhaps in familiar use among the Greeks at the time he wrote, was however intelligible. From the Homeric to the Socratic age, a period had elapsed of no less than 400 years; during which the style both of discourse and of writing must have undergone great alterations. Yet the Iliad continued the standard of heroic poetry, and was considered as the very perfection of poetical language; notwithstanding that some words in it were become antiquated, or so ambiguous, that Aristotle himself seems to have been somewhat doubtful in regard to their meaning. And Poetic if Chaucer's merit as a poet had been as great as Horace's, and the English tongue under Edward III., as perfect as the Greek was in the second century after the Trojan war, the style of Chaucer would probably have been our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for poetical diction at this day; even as Petrarch, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>, is still imitated by the best poets of Italy.\n\nThe rudeness of the style of Ennius has been imputed by the old critics to his having copied too closely the dialect of common life. But this appears to be a mistake. For if we compare the fragments of that author with the comedies of Plautus, who flourished in the same age, and whose language was certainly copied from that of common life, we shall be struck with an air of antiquity in the former that is not in the latter. Ennius, no doubt, like most other sublime poets, affected something of the antique in his expression: and many of his words and phrases, not adopted by any prose-writer now extant, are to be found in Lucretius and Virgil, and were by them transmitted to succeeding poets. These The poetical form part of the Roman poetical dialect; which appears different from the writings of Virgil, where we have it in perfection, to have been very copious. The style of this charming poet is indeed so different from prose, and is altogether so peculiar, that it is perhaps impossible to analyse it on the common principles of Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>. And yet no author can be more perspicuous or more expressive; notwithstanding the frequency of Greekism in his syntax, and his love of old words, which he, in the judgement of Quintilian, knew better than any other man how to improve into decoration.\n\nThe poetical dialect of modern Italy is so different from the prosaic, that persons who can read the historians, and even speak with tolerable fluency the language of that country, may yet find it difficult to construe a page of Petrarch or Tasso. Yet it is not probable, that Petrarch, whose works are a standard of the Italian poetical diction \u00a7, made any material innovations in his native tongue. It is rather probable that he wrote it nearly as it was spoken in his time, that is, in the 14th century; omitting only harsh combinations, and taking that liberty which Homer probably, and Virgil certainly, took before him, of reviving such old, but not obsolete expressions, as seemed peculiarly significant and melodious; and polishing his style to that degree of elegance which human speech, without becoming...\nPoetical words unnatural, may admit of, and which the genius of poetry, as an art subservient to pleasure, may be thought to require.\n\nThe French poetry in general is distinguished from prose rather by the rhyme and the measure, than by any old or uncommon phraseology. Yet the French, on certain subjects, imitate the style of their old poets, of Marot in particular; and may therefore be said to have something of a poetical dialect, though far less extensive than the Italian, or even than the English. And it may be presumed, that in future ages they will have more of this dialect than they have at present. This may be inferred from the very uncommon merit of some of their late poets, particularly Boiteau and La Fontaine, who, in their respective departments, will continue to be imitated, when the present modes of French prose are greatly changed: an event that, for all the pains they take to preserve their language, must inevitably happen, and whereof there are not wanting some prefigures already.\n\nThe English poetical dialect is not characterized by any peculiarities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTONATION\">intonation</a>, nor by any great latitude in the use of foreign idioms. More copious it is, however, than one would at first imagine; as may appear from the following specimen and observations.\n\n(1.) A few Greek and Latin idioms are common in English poetry, which are seldom or never to be met with in prose. (Quenched by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>.) Shakespeare.\u2014Shorn of his beams. Milton.\u2014Created thing nor valued he nor shun'd. Milton.\u2014'Tis thus we riot, while who sow it starve. Pope.\u2014This day be dread and peace my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>. Pope.\u2014Into what pit thou sel'st from what height fallen. Milton. He deceived the mother of mankind. What time his pride had cast him out of heaven. Milton.\u2014Some of these, with others to be found in Milton, seem to have been adopted for the sake of brevity, which in the poetical tongue is indispensible. For the same reason, perhaps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> a and the are sometimes omitted by our poets, though less frequently in serious than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> composition.\u2014In English, the adjective generally goes before the substantive, the nominative before the verb, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> verb before (what we call) the accusative. Exceptions, however, to this rule, are not uncommon even in prose. But in poetry they are more frequent. Their lonely joys, and destiny obscure. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the right; and all the air a solemn stillness holds. In general, that verification may be less difficult, and the cadence more uniformly pleasing; and sometimes, too, in order to give energy to expression, or vivacity to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a>,\u2014the English poet is permitted to take much greater liberties than the prose-writer, in arranging his words, and modulating his lines and periods. Examples may be seen in every page of Paradise Lost.\n\n(2.) Some of our poetical words take an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>, that they may suit the verse the better; as, disport, distain, disport, affright, enchain, for part, stain, sport, fright, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>. Others seem to be nothing else than common words made shorter, for the convenience of the versifier. Such are, auxiliar, fulminal, trump, vale, part, clime, fulmis, frolic, plain, drear, dread, helm, morn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAD\">mead</a>, eye and even, gan, illume and illumine, ope, hoar, hide, savage, escape; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a>, fulminary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>, valley, depart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, submissive, frolic-\n\nfome, complain, dreary, dreadful, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, evening, began or began to, illuminate, open, hoary, abide, affluage, escape.\u2014Of some of these the short form is the more ancient. In Scotland, even, morn, hide, savage, are still in vulgar use; but morn, except when contradistinguished to even, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>, not with morning (as in the English poetical dialect), but with morrow. The Latin poets, in a way somewhat similar, and perhaps for a similar reason, shortened fundamentum, tutamentum, munimentum, &c. into fundament, tutamen, muniment.\n\n(3.) Of the following words, which are now almost peculiar to poetry, the greater part are ancient, and were once no doubt in common use in England, as many of them still are in Scotland. Afield, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAIN\">amain</a>, annoy (a noun), anon, aye (ever), behoof, blithe, brand (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>), bridal, carol, dame (lady), fealty, fell (an adjective), gaude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GORE\">gore</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a> (army), lambkin, late (of late), lay (poem), len, glade, gleam, hurl, lore, meed, orifion, pod (to travel laboriously), ringlet, rue (a verb) ruth, ruthless, sojourn (a noun), finite, speed (an active verb), fave (except), spray (twig), fleed, flaim (long), brand, swain, thrall, thrill, trail (a verb), troll, wall, weller, warble, wayward, woo, the while (in the mean time), yon, of yore.\n\n(4.) These that follow are also poetical; but, so far as appears, were never in common use. Appal, arraivy, attune, battalions, breezy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-CAR\">car</a> (chariot), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARION\">clarion</a>, cates, courier, darkling, flicker, floweret, emblose, gairds, circlet, imperil, nightly, nofelefs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> (wing), shadowy, lumberous, firesamp, troublous, wilder (a verb), jostle (a verb), shook (shaken), madding, viewless.\u2014The following, too, derived from the Greek and Latin, seem peculiar to poetry. Clang, clangor, choral, bland, boreal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIRE\">aire</a>, ensanguined, ire, irreful, lave (to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a>), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NYMPH\">nymph</a>, (ladie, girl), orient, panoply, phantom, infuriate, rescind, radiant, rept, redolent, refugent, verdant, vernal, zeplify, zone (girdle), syjuen, suffe.\n\n(5.) In most languages, the rapidity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> abbreviates some of the commonest words, or even joins two, or perhaps more, of them, into one; and some of those abbreviated forms find admission into writing. The English language was quite disgusted by them in the end of the last century; but Swift, by his satire and example, brought them into disrepute: and, though some of them be retained in conversation, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">don</a>'t, shan't, can't, they are now avoided in solemn style; and by elegant writers in general, except where the colloquial dialect is imitated, as in comedy. 'Tis and 'twas, since the time of Shattelbury, seem to have been daily losing credit, at least in prose; but still have a place in poetry, perhaps because they contribute to conciseness. 'Twas on a lofty vales side. Gray.\u2014'Tis true, 'tis certain, man, though dead, retains part of himself. Pope. In verse too, over may be shortened into o'er, (which is the Scotch, and probably was the old English, pronunciation); never into ne'er; and from the and to, when they go before a word beginning with a vowel, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> letter is sometimes cut off. O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go. Pope.\u2014Where'er she turns, the Graces homage pay. And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave. Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll. Gray.\u2014T'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> th' eternal midnight of the grave.\u2014These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a> are now peculiar to the poetical tongue, but not necessary to it. They sometimes\nOf poetical sometimes promote brevity, and render verification less difficult.\n\n(6.) Those words which are commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> epithets, as rosy-finger'd, rosy-bosom'd, many-twinkling, many-sounding, mus-grown, bright-eyed, straw-built, spirit-flaring, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>-breathing, heaven taught, love-whispering, lute-refraining, are also to be considered as part of our poetical dialect. It is true, we have compound-ed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADJECTIVES\">adjectives</a> in familiar use, as high-peonied, well-natured, ill-bred, and innumerable others. But we speak of those that are less common, that seldom occur except in poetry, and of which in prose the use would appear affected. And that they sometimes promote brevity and vivacity of expression, cannot be denied. But as they give, when too frequent, a stiff and finical air to a performance; as they are not always explicit in the sense, nor agreeable in the sound; as they are apt to produce a confusion, or too great a multiplicity, of images; as they tend to disfigure the language, and furnish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for endless innovation; they ought to be used sparingly; and those only used which the practice of popular authors has rendered familiar to the ear, and which are in themselves peculiarly emphatical and harmonious.\n\n(7.) In the transformation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOUNS\">nouns</a> into verbs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PARTICIPLES\">participles</a>, our poetical dialect admits of greater latitude than prose. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYMN\">Hymn</a>, pillow, curtain, story, pillar, picture, peel, surge, cavern, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, cincture, bosom, sphere, are common nouns; but to hymn, to pillow, curtained, pillared, pictured, pealing, surging, cavern'd, honied, careering, cinctured, bosomed, sphered, would appear affected in prose, and yet in verse they are warranted by great authorities, though it must be confessed that they are censured by an able critic* who had studied the English language, both poetical and profane, with wonderful diligence.\n\nSome late poets, particularly the imitators of Spenser, have introduced a great variety of uncommon words, as certes, estoons, ne, whilom, tranfnew, moil, fone, lofet, alse, hight, right, plight, thews, coulthul, affot, muchel, wend, arrear, &c. These were once poetical words, no doubt; but they are now obsolete, and to many readers unintelligible. No man of the present age, however conversant in this dialect, would naturally express himself in it on any interesting emergence; or, supposing this natural to the antiquarian, it would never appear so to the common hearer or reader. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of these words, therefore, must ruin the pathos of modern language; and as they are not familiar to our ear, and plainly appear to be sought after and affected, will generally give a stiffness to modern verification. Yet in subjects approaching to the ludicrous they may have a good effect; as in the Schoolmirefs of Shenstone, Parnell's Fairy-tale, Thomson's Castle of Indolence, and Pope's lines in the Dunciad upon Wormius. But this effect will be most pleasing to those who have least occasion to recur to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLOSSARY\">glossary</a>.\n\nIndeed, it is not always easy to fix the boundary between poetical and obsolete expressions. To many readers,\n\n* Johnson.\n\nlore, meed, beneft, bliche, gaude, pray, thrall, may already appear antiquated; and to some the style of Spenser, or even of Chaucer, may be as intelligible as that of Dryden. This however we may venture to affirm, that a word, which the majority of readers cannot understand without a glossary, may with reason be considered as obsolete; and ought not to be used in modern composition, unless revived, and recommended to the public ear, by some very eminent writer. There are but few words in Milton, as nathless, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TINE\">tine</a>, frore, bofky, &c.; there are but one or two in Dryden, as falify (v); and in Pope, there are none at all, which every reader of our poetry may not be supposed to understand; whereas in Shakespeare, there are many, and in Spenser many more, for which one who knows English very well may be obliged to consult the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>. The practice of Milton, Dryden, or Pope, may therefore, in almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, be admitted as good authority for the use of a poetical word. And in them, all the words above enumerated, as poetical, and in present use, may actually be found. And of such poets as may choose to observe this rule, it will not be said, either that they reject the judgment of Quintilian, who recommends the newest of the old words, and the oldest of the new, or that they are inattentive to Pope's precept;\n\nBe not the first by whom the new are tried,\nNor yet the last to lay the old aside.\n\nEff. on Crit. v. 335.\n\nWe must not suppose that these poetical words never occur at all except in poetry. Even from conversation they are not excluded: and the ancient critics allow, that they may be admitted into prose, where they occasionally confer dignity upon a sublime subject, or heighten the ludicrous qualities of a mean one. But it is in poetry only where the frequent use of them does not favour of affectation.\n\nNor must we suppose them essential to this art. Many passages there are of exquisite poetry, wherein not a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> occurs that might not be used in prose. In fact, the influence of these words in adorning English verse is not very extensive. Some influence however they have. They serve to render the poetical style, first, more melodious; and, secondly, more solemn.\n\nFirst, They render the poetical style more melodious, in which and more easily reducible into measure. Words of unlike they wieldy size, or difficult pronunciation, are never used by the poetical poets, where they can be avoided: unless in their style more found they have something imitative of the sense. Homer's melodious poetical inflections contribute wonderfully to the sweetness of his numbers: and if the reader is pleased to look back to the specimen above given of the English poetical dialect, he will find that the words are in general well-founded, and such as may coalesce with other words, without producing harsh combinations. Quintilian observes, that poets, for the sake of their verse, are indulged in many liberties, not granted to the orator, of lengthening, shortening, and dividing their words * \u2014 * Inquit Orat. lib. x. cap. i. \u00a7 3.\n\nAnd if the Greek and Roman poets claimed this indulgence, cap. i. \u00a7 3.\n\n(d) Dryden in one place (\u00c6neid ix. verf. 1995.) uses Falsified to denote Pierced through and through. He acknowledges, that this use of the word is an innovation; and has nothing to plead for it but his own authority, and that Falfare in Italian sometimes means the same thing.\nPoetry.\n\nOr poetical gence from necessity, and obtained it, the English, those words of them especially who write in rhyme, may claim it with better reason; as the words of their language are less musical and far less susceptible of variety in arrangement and syntax.\n\nSecondly, Such poetical words as are known to be ancient have something venerable in their appearance, and impart a solemnity to all around them. This remark is from Quintilian; who adds, that they give to a composition that call and colour of antiquity which in painting is so highly valued, but which art can never effectually imitate. Poetical words that are either not ancient, or not known to be such, have, however, a pleasing effect from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>. We are accustomed to meet with them in sublime and elegant writing; and hence they come to acquire sublimity and elegance: Even as the words we hear on familiar occasions come to be accounted familiar; and as those that take their rise among pick-pockets, gamblers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GYPSIES\">gypsies</a>, are thought too indelicate to be used by any person of taste or good manners. When one hears the following lines, which abound in poetical words,\n\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\nThe cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>,\nNo more shall roule them from their lowly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>:\n\n\u2014one is as sensible of the dignity of the language, as one would be of the vileness or vulgarity of that man's speech, who should prove his acquaintance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDEWELL\">Bridewell</a>, by interlarding his discourse with such terms as mill-doll, queer cull, or noddling cheat; or who, in imitation of tops and gamblers, should on the common occasions of life, talk of being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> hollow, or saving his distance.\n\nWhat gives dignity to persons gives dignity to language. A man of this character is one who has borne important employments, been connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> associates, and never degraded himself by levity or immorality of conduct. Dignified phrases are those which have been used to express elevated sentiments, have always made their appearance in elegant composition, and have never been profaned by giving permanency or utterance to the passions of the vile, the giddy, or the worthless. And as by an active old age, the dignity of such men is confirmed and heightened; so the dignity of such words, if they be not suffered to fall into disuse, seldom fails to improve by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time.\n\nArt. II. Of Tropes and Figures.\n\nIf it appear that, by means of figures, language may be made more pleasing and more natural than it would be without them; it will follow, that to poetical language, whose end is to please by imitating nature, figures must be not only ornamental, but necessary. It will here be proper, therefore, first to point out the importance and utility of figurative language; secondly, to show, that figures are more necessary to poetry in general than to any other mode of writing.\n\nI. As to the importance and utility of figurative expression, in making language more pleasing and more natural; it may be remarked,\n\n(1.) That tropes and figures are often necessary to supply the unavoidable defects of language. When proper words are wanting, or not recollected, or when we do not choose to be always repeating them, we must have recourse to tropes and figures. When philosophers began to explain the operations of the mind, they found that most of the words in common use, being framed to answer the more obvious exigencies of life, were in their proper signification applicable to matter only and its supplying qualities. What was to be done in this case? Would they think of making a new language to express the qualities of mind? No; that would have been difficult and impracticable; and granting it both practicable and easy, they must have foreseen, that nobody would read or listen to what was thus spoken or written in a new and consequently in an unknown tongue. They therefore took the language as they found it; and wherever they thought there was a similarity or analogy between the qualities of the mind and the qualities of matter, scrupled not to use the names of the material qualities tropically, by applying them to the mental qualities. Hence came the phrases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> of judgement, warmth of imagination, enlargement of understanding, and many others; which, though figurative, express the meaning just as well as proper words would have done. In fact, numerous as the words in every language are, they must always fall short of the unbounded variety of human thoughts and perceptions. Talles and finials are almost as numerous as the species of bodies. Sounds admit of perceptible varieties that surpass all computation, and the seven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> colours may be diversified without end. If each variety of external perception were to have a name, language would be insurmountably difficult; nay, if men were to appropriate a class of names to each particular sense, they would multiply words exceedingly, without adding any thing to the clearness of speech. Those words, therefore, that in their proper signification denote the objects of one sense, we often apply tropically to the objects of another, and say, Sweet taste, sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, sweet sound; sharp point, sharp tale, sharp sound; harmony of sounds, harmony of colour, harmony of parts; soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, soft colour, soft sound, soft temper; and so in a thousand instances: and yet these words, in their tropical signification, are not less intelligible than in their proper one; for sharp tale and sharp sound, are as expressive as sharp sword; and harmony of tones is not better understood by the musician, than harmony of parts by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, and harmony of colours by the painter.\n\nSavages, illiterate persons, and children, have comparatively but few words in proportion to the things they may have occasion to speak of; and must therefore recur to tropes and figures more frequently than persons of copious elocution. A seaman, or mechanic, even when he talks of that which does not belong to his art, borrows his language from that which does; and this makes his diction figurative to a degree that is sometimes entertaining enough. \"Death (says a seaman in one of Smollet's novels) has not yet boarded my comrade; but they have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>-arm and yard-arm the three glaister. His starboard eye is open, but fast jammed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; and the halyards of his under jaw have given way.\" These phrases are exaggerated; but we allow them to be natural, because we know that illiterate people are apt to make use of tropes and figures taken from their own trade, even when they speak of things that are very remote and incongruous. In those poems, therefore, that imitate the conversation of illiterate persons, as in comedy, farce, and pastoral, such figures judiciously\nOf Tropes diciously applied may render the imitation more pleasing, because more exact and natural.\n\nWords that are unmeasurable and harsh, the poet is often obliged to avoid, when perhaps he has no other way to express their meaning than by tropes and figures; and sometimes the measure of his verse may oblige him to reject a proper word that is not harsh, merely on account of its being too long, or too short, or in any other way unfitting to the rhythm, or to the rhyme. And hence another use of figurative language, that it contributes to poetical harmony. Thus, to press the plain, is frequently used to signify to be plain in battle; liquid plain is put for ocean, blue serene for sky, and sylvan reign for country life.\n\n(2.) Tropes and figures are favourable to delicacy. When the proper name of a thing is in any respect unpleasant, a well-chosen trope will convey the idea in such a way as to give no offence. This is agreeable, and even necessary, in polite conversation, and cannot be dispensed with in elegant writing of any kind. Many words, from their being often applied to vulgar use, acquire a meaning that disqualifies them for a place in serious poetry; while perhaps, under the influence of a different system of manners, the corresponding words in another language may be elegant, or at least not vulgar. When one reads Homer in the Greek, one takes no offence at his calling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUMENES\">Eumenes</a> by a name which, literally rendered, signifies swine-herd; first, because the Greek word is well-founded in itself; secondly, because we have never heard it pronounced in conversation, nor consequently debased by vulgar use; and, thirdly, because we know, that the office denoted by it was, in the age of Eumenes, both important and honourable. But Pope would have been blamed, if a name so indelicate as swine-herd had in his translation been applied to so eminent a personage; and therefore he judiciously makes use of the trope synecdoche, and calls him swain; a word both elegant and poetical, and not likely to lead the reader into any mistake about the person spoken of, as his employment had been described in a preceding passage. The same Eumenes is said, in the simple but melodious language of the original, to have been making his own shoes when Ulysses came to his door; a work which in those days the greatest heroes would often find necessary. This, too, the translator softens by a topical expression:\n\nHere sat Eumenes, and his cares applied,\nTo form strong byllins of well seasoned hide.\n\nA hundred other examples might be quoted from this translation; but these will explain our meaning.\n\nThere are other occasions on which the delicacy of figurative language is still more needful; as in Virgil's account of the effects of animal love, and of the plague among the beasts, in the third Georgic; where Dryden's style, by being less figurative than the original, is in one place exceedingly filthy, and in another shockingly obscene.\n\nHobbes could confute a Greek author; but his skill in words must have been all derived from the dictionary; for he seems not to have known that any one articulate sound could be more agreeable, or any one phrase more dignified than another. In his Iliad and Odyssy, even when he hits the author's sense (which is not always the case), he proves, by his choice of words, that of harmony, elegance, or energy of style, he had no manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. And hence that work, though called a Translation of Homer, does not even deserve the name of poem; because it is in every respect unpleasing, being nothing more than a fictitious narrative delivered in a mean prose, with the additional means of harsh rhyme and unmeasurable measure.\u2014Trapp understood Virgil well enough as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a>, and had a taste for his beauties; yet his translation bears no resemblance to Virgil; which is owing to the same cause, an imprudent choice of words and figures, and a total want of harmony.\n\nThe delicacy we here contend for may, indeed, both which, in conversation and in writing, be carried too far. To call killing an innocent man in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a> an affair of honour, and rid too far a violation of the rights of wedlock an affair of gallantry, is a profanation of figurative language. Nor is it any credit to us, that we are said to have upwards of 40 figurative phrases to express excellent drinking. Language of this sort generally implies, that the public abhorrence of such crimes is not so strong as it ought to be; and it is a question, whether even our morals might not be improved, if we were to call these and such like crimes by their proper names, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUTTONY\">gluttony</a>; names that not only express our meaning, but also beget our disapprobation.\u2014As to writing, it cannot be denied, that even Pope himself, in the excellent version just now quoted, has sometimes, for the sake of his numbers, or for fear of giving offence by too close an imitation of Homer's simplicity, employed tropes and figures too quaint or too solemn for the occasion.\n\nAnd the finical style is in part characterized by the writer's dislike to literal expressions, and affectedly substituting in their stead unnecessary tropes and figures. With these authors, a man's only child must always be his only hope; a country maid becomes a rural beauty, or perhaps a nymph of the groves; if flattery sing at all, it must be a syren song; the shepherd's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a> dwindles into an oaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>, and his crook is exalted into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a>; the silver lilies rise from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> beds, and languish to the complaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a>. A young woman, though a good Christian, cannot make herself agreeable without sacrificing to the Graces; nor hope to do any execution among the gentle swains, till a whole legion of Cupids, armed with flames and darts, and other weapons, begin to discharge from her eyes their formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. For the sake of variety, or of the verse, some of these figures may now and then find a place in a poem; but in prose, unless very sparingly used, they favour of affectation.\n\n(3.) Tropes and figures promote brevity; and brevity, united with perspicuity, is always agreeable. An example or two will be given in the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>. Sentiments thus delivered, and imagery, thus painted, are readily apprehended, by the mind, make a strong impression upon the fancy, and remain long in the memory; whereas too many words, even when the meaning is good, never fail to bring disgust and weariness. They argue a debility of mind which hinders the author from seeing his thoughts in one distinct point of view; and they also encourage a suspicion, that there is something faulty or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> in the matter. In the poetical style, therefore, which is addressed to the fancy and passions, and intended to make a vivid, a pleasing, and a permanent impression, brevity, and consequently tropes and figures, are indispensable. And a language will always be\nOf Tropes be the better suited to poetical purposes, the more it admits of this brevity\u2014a character which is more conspicuous in the Greek and Latin than in any modern tongue, and much less in the French than in the Italian or English.\n\n(4.) Tropes and figures contribute to strength or energy of language, not only by their conciseness, but also by conveying to the fancy ideas that are easily comprehended, and make a strong impression. We are powerfully affected with what we see, or feel, or hear. When a sentiment comes enforced or illustrated by figures taken from objects of sight, or touch, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>, one thinks, as it were, that one sees, or feels, or hears, the thing spoken of; and thus, what in itself would perhaps be obscure, or is merely intellectual, may be made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> our attention and interest our passions almost as effectually as if it were an object of outward sense. When Virgil calls the Scipios thunderbolts of war, he very strongly expresses in one word, and by one image, the rapidity of their victories, the noise their achievements made in the world, and the ruin and consternation that attended their irresistible career.\u2014When Homer calls Ajax the bulwark of the Greeks, he paints with equal brevity his vast size and strength, the difficulty of prevailing against him, and the confidence wherewith his countrymen repose on his valour.\u2014When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> says of the strange woman, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARLOT\">harlot</a>, that \u201cher feet go down to death,\u201d he lets us know, not only that her path ends in destruction, but also, that they who accompany her will find it easy to go forwards to ruin, and difficult to return to their duty.\u2014Satan\u2019s enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, and resplendent appearance, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> ascent through a region of darkness, and the inconceivable rapidity of his motion, are all painted out to our fancy by Milton, in one very short similitude,\n\nSprung upward, like\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of fire.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">Par</a>. Lof. iv. 1013.\n\nTo take in the full meaning of which figure, we must imagine ourselves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a>, and a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> body rising upwards, near the place where we are, so swiftly as to appear a continued track of light, and lessening to the view according to the increase of distance, till it end in a point, and then disappear; and all this must be supposed to strike our eye at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>.\u2014Equal to this in propriety, though not in magnificence, is that allegory of Gray,\n\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave:\n\nWhich presents to the imagination a wide plain, where several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> appear, crowded with glittering multitudes, and issuing from different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, but drawing nearer and nearer as they advance, till they terminate in the dark and narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where all their glories enter in succession, and disappear for ever.\u2014When it is said in Scripture, of a good man who died, that he fell asleep, what a number of ideas are at once conveyed to our imagination, by this beautiful and expressive figure: As a labourer, at the close of day, goes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, with the satisfaction of having performed his work, and with the agreeable hope of awakening in the morning of a new day, refreshed and cheerful; so a good man, at the end of life, resigns himself calm and contented to the will of his Maker, with the sweet reflection of having endeavoured to do his duty, and with the transporting hope of soon awaking in the regions of light, to life and happiness eternal. The figure also suggests, that to a good man the transition from life to death is, even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, no more painful, than when our faculties melt away into the pleasing insensibility of sleep.\u2014Satan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> among the stars, is said by Milton to \u201cfall between worlds and worlds;\u201d which has an elegance and force far superior to the proper word fly. For by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to a ship, we are made to form a lively idea of his great size, and to conceive of his motion, that it was equable and majestic.\u2014Virgil uses a happy figure to express the size of the great wooden horse, by means of which the Greeks were conveyed into Troy: \u201cEquum divina Palladis arte adficient.\u201d\u2014Milton is still bolder when he says,\n\nWho would not sing for Lycidas! he knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.\n\nThe phrase, however, though bold, is emphatical; and gives a noble idea of the durability of poetry, as well as of the art and attention requisite to form a good poem.\u2014There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of tropical expressions in common use, incomparably more energetic than any proper words of equal brevity that could be put in their place. A cheek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> with blushes, is a trope which at once describes the colour as it appears to the beholder, and the glowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> as it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> by the person <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLUSHING\">blushing</a>. Chilled with despondency, petrified with astonishment, thunderstruck with disagreeable and unexpected intelligence, melted with love or pity, dissolved in luxury, hardened in wickedness, softened into remorse, inflamed with desire, soiled with uncertainty, &c.\u2014every one is sensible of the force of these and the like phrases, and that they must contribute to the energy of composition.\n\n(5.) Tropes and figures promote strength of expression; and are in poetry peculiarly requisite, because they are often more natural, and more imitative, than proper words. In fact, this is so much the case, that it would be impossible to imitate the language of passion without them. It is true, that when the mind is agitated, one does not run out into allegories, or long-winded similitudes, or any of the figures that require much attention and many words, or that tend to withdraw the fancy from the object of the passion. Yet the language of many passions must be figurative notwithstanding; because they rouse the fancy, and direct it to objects congenial to their own nature, which diversify the language of the speaker with a multitude of allusions. The fancy of a very angry man, for example, prefers to his view a train of disagreeable ideas connected with the passion of anger, and tending to encourage it; and if he speak without restraint during the paroxysm of his rage, those ideas will force themselves upon him, and compel him to give them utterance. \u201cInfernal monster! (he will say),\u2014my blood boils at him; he has used me like a dog; never was man so injured as I have been by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARIAN\">barbarian</a>. He has no more sense of propriety than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. His countenance is diabolical, and his soul as ugly as his countenance. His heart is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and hard, and his resolutions dark and bloody,\u201d &c. This speech is wholly figurative. It is made up of metaphors and hyperboles, which, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROLEPSIS\">prolepsis</a> and apostrophe, are the most passionate of all the figures. Lear, driven out of doors by his unnatural daughters, in the midst of darkness, thunder, and tempest, naturally\nPart I.\n\nOf Trope rally breaks forth (for his indignation is just now raised and to the very highest pitch) into the following violent exclamation against the crimes of mankind, in which almost every word is figurative:\n\nTremble, thou wretch,\nThat hast within thee undivulged crimes\nUnwhipt of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,\nThou perjur'd, and thou simular of virtue,\nThat art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,\nThat under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a>, and convenient seeming,\nHalf practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,\nRive your concealing continents, and cry\nThese dreadful summoners grace. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Lear.\n\nThe vehemence of maternal love, and sorrow from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of losing her child, make the Lady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCE\">Constance</a> utter a language that is strongly figurative, though quite suitable to the condition and character of the speaker. The passage is too long for a quotation, but concludes thus:\n\nO <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>! my boy, my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>, my fair son,\nMy life, my joy, my food, my all the world,\nMy widow-comfort, and my sorrow's cure. King John.\n\nSimilar to this, and equally expressive of conjugal love, is that beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPERBOLE\">hyperbole</a> in Homer; where Andromache, to dissuade her husband from going out to the battle, tells him that she had now no mother, father, or brethren, all her kindred being dead, and her native country desolate; and then tenderly adds,\n\nBut while my Hector yet survives, I see\nMy father, mother, brethren, all in thee. Iliad, b. vi.\n\nAs the passions that agitate the soul, and rouse the fancy, are apt to vent themselves in tropes and figures, so those that depress the mind adopt for the most part a plain diction without any ornament: for to a dejected mind, wherein the imagination is generally inactive, it is not probable that any great variety of ideas will present themselves; and when these are few and familiar, the words that express them must be simple. As no author equals Shakespeare in boldness or variety of figures when he copies the style of those violent passions that stimulate the fancy; so, when he would exhibit the human mind in a dejected state, no uninspired writer excels him in simplicity. The same Lear whose resentment had impaired his understanding, while it broke out in the most boisterous language, when, after some medical applications, he recovers his reason, his rage being now exhausted, his pride humbled, and his spirits totally depressed, speaks in a style than which nothing can be imagined more simple or more affecting.\n\nPray, do not mock me:\nI am a very foolish, fond old man;\nFourscore and upward; and, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> plainly with you,\nI fear I am not in my perfect mind.\nMethinks I should know you, and know this man;\nYet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant\nWhat place this is; and all the skill I have\nRemembers not these garments: nor I know not\nWhere I did lodge last night. Lear, Act iv. sc. 7.\n\n\u2014Desdemona, ever gentle, artless, and sincere, shocked at the unkindness of her husband, and overcome with melancholy, speaks in a style so beautifully simple, and so perfectly natural, that one knows not what to say in commendation of it:\n\nMy mother had a maid call'd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARA\">Barbara</a>;\nShe was in love, and he she lov'd prov'd false,\nAnd did forlike her. She had a long of willow;\nAn old thing it was, but it exprest her fortune,\nAnd the died fingering it. That long to-night\nWill not go from my mind: I have much to do,\nBut to go hang my head all at one side,\nAnd sing it like poor Barbara, Othello, Act iv. sc. 3.\n\nSometimes the imagination, even when exerted to the utmost, takes in but few ideas. This happens when the attention is totally engrossed by some very great object; admiration being one of those emotions that rather suspend the exercise of the faculties than push them into action. And here, too, the simplest language is the most natural; as when Milton says of the Deity, that he sits \"high-throned above all height.\" And as to the this simplicity is more suitable to that one great exertion of sentiment which occupies the speaker's mind than a more elaborate imagery or language would have been, so has it also a more powerful effect in fixing and elevating the imagination of the hearer; for to introduce other thoughts for the sake of illustrating what cannot be illustrated, could answer no other purpose than to draw off the attention from the principal idea. In these and the like cases, the fancy left to itself will have more satisfaction in pursuing at leisure its own speculations than in attending to those of others; as they who see for the first time some admirable object would choose rather to feast upon it in silence, than to have their thoughts interrupted by a long description from another person, informing them of nothing but what they see before them, are already acquainted with, or may easily conceive.\n\nIt was remarked above that the hyperbole, presopoeia, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOPHTHEGM\">apophthegm</a>, are among the most passionate figures. This deserves illustration.\n\n1st, A very angry man is apt to think the injury he has just received greater than it really is; and if he proceed immediately to retaliate by word or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, seldom fails to exceed the due bounds, and to become injurious love, fear, in his turn. The fond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> looks upon his child as a prodigy of genius and beauty; and the romantic lover will not be persuaded that his mistress has nothing supernatural either in her mind or person. Fear, in like manner, not only magnifies its object when real, but even forms an object out of nothing, and mistakes the fictions of fancy for the intimations of sense.\u2014No wonder, then, that they who speak according to the impulse of passion should speak hyperbolically; that the angry man should exaggerate the injury he has received, and the vengeance he is going to inflict; that the sorrowful should magnify what they have lost, and the joyful what they have obtained; that the lover should speak extravagantly of the beauty of his mistress, the coward of the dangers he has encountered, and the credulous clown of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> performed by the juggler. In fact, these people would not do justice to what they feel if they did not say more than the truth. The valiant man, on the other hand, as naturally adopts the diminishing hyperbole when he speaks of danger; and the man of sense, when he is obliged to mention his own virtue or ability; because it appears to him, or he is willing to consider.\nOf Tropes consider it, as less than the truth, or at best as inconsiderable. Contempt uses the same figure; and therefore Petruchio, affecting that passion, affects also the language of it:\n\nThou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,\nThou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, nail,\nThou fleas, thou nit, thou winter-cricket, thou!\nBrav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!\nAway, thou rag, thou <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, thou remnant!\n\n*Taming of the Shrew*, Act iv. sc. 1.\n\nFor some passions consider their objects as important, and others as unimportant. Of the former sort are anger, love, fear, admiration, joy, sorrow, pride; of the latter are contempt and courage. Those may be said to subdue the mind to the object, and these to subdue the object to the mind. And the former, when violent, always magnify their objects; whence the hyperbole called amplification, or *aixefia*; and the latter as constantly diminish theirs; and give rise to the hyperbole called *meifia*, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>.\u2014Even when the mind cannot be said to be under the influence of any violent passion, we naturally employ the same figure when we would impress another very strongly with any idea. \"He is a walking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a>; he is worn to skin and bone; he has one foot in the grave and the other following;\"\u2014these, and the like phrases, are proved to be natural by their frequency. By introducing great ideas, the hyperbole is further useful in poetry as a source of the sublime; but when employed injudiciously is very apt to become ridiculous. Cowley makes Goliath as big as us.\n\n*Daviddeit*, the hill down which he was marching*; and tells us, that when he came into the valley he seemed to fill it, and to overtop the neighbouring mountains (which, by the by, seems rather to lessen the mountains and valleys than to magnify the giant); nay, he adds, that the sun started back when he saw the splendour of his arms. This poet seems to have thought that the figure in question could never be sufficiently enormous; but Quintilian would have taught him, \"Quamvis omnis hyperbole ultra fidem, non tamen effe debet ultra modum.\"\n\nThe reason is, that this figure, when excessive, betokens rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> infatuation than intense emotion; and resembles the efforts of a ranting tragedian, or the ravings of an enthusiastic declaimer, who, by putting on the gestures and looks of a lunatic, satisfy the discerning part of their audience, that, instead of feeling strongly, they have no rational feelings at all. In the wildest energies of nature there is a modesty which the imitative artist will be careful never to overstep.\n\n2dly, That figure, by which things are spoken of as if they were persons, is called *protopoecia*, or personification. It is a bold figure, and yet is often natural. Long acquaintance recommends to some share in our affection even things inanimate, as a house, a tree, a rock, a mountain, a country; and were we to hear such a thing without hope of return, we should be inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> it with a farewell, as if it were a percipient creature. Hence it was that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> queen of Scotland, when on her return to her own kingdom, so affectionately bade adieu to the country which she had left. \"Farewell France,\" said she; \"farewell, beloved country, which I shall never more behold!\" Nay, we find that ignorant names have actually worshipped such things, or considered them as the haunt of certain powerful beings. Dryads and hamadryads were by the Greeks and Romans supposed to preside over trees and groves; river gods and nymphs, over streams and fountains; little deities, called *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARES\">Lares</a>* and *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENATES\">Penates</a>*, were believed to be the guardians of hearths and houses. In Scotland there is hardly a hill remarkable for the beauty of its shape, that was not in former times thought to be the habitation of fairies. Nay, modern as well as ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> has appropriated the waters to a peculiar sort of demon or goblin, and people the very regions of death, the tombs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARNEL\">charnel</a>-houses, with multitudes of ghosts and phantoms.\u2014Besides, when things inanimate make a strong impression upon us, whether agreeable or otherwise, we are apt to address them in terms of affection or dislike. The sailor blesses the plank that brought him ashore from the shipwreck; and the paffionate man, and sometimes even the philosopher, will say bitter words to the stumbling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> that gave him a fall.\u2014Moreover, a man agitated with any interesting passion, especially of long continuance, is apt to fancy that all nature sympathizes with him. If he has lost a beloved friend, he thinks the sun lies brighter than at other times; and in the sighing of the winds and groves, in the lowings of the herd, and in the murmurs of the stream, he seems to hear the voice of lamentation. But when joy or hope predominate, the whole world assumes a gay appearance. In the contemplation of every part of nature, of every condition of mankind, of every form of human society, the benevolent and the pious man, the morose and the cheerful, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISER\">miser</a> and the philanthrope, finds occasion to indulge his favourite passion, and fees, or thinks he fees, his own temper reflected back in the actions, sympathies, and tendencies of other things and persons. Our affections are indeed the medium through which we may be said to survey ourselves, and everything else; and whatever be our inward frame, we are apt to perceive a wonderful congeniality in the world without us. And hence the fancy, when roused by real emotions, or by the pathos of composition, is easily reconciled to those figures of speech that ascribe sympathy, perception, and the other attributes of animal life, to things inanimate, or even to notions merely intellectual.\n\nMotion, too, bears a close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to action, and affects our imagination nearly in the same manner; and we see a great part of nature in motion, and by its sensible effects are led to contemplate energies innumerable. These conduct the rational mind to the Great First Cause; and these, in times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, duped the vulgar to believe in a variety of subordinate agents employed in producing those appearances that could not otherwise be accounted for. Hence an endless train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> deities, and of witches, demons, fairies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENII\">genii</a>; which, if they prove our reason weak and our fancy strong, prove also that personification is natural to the human mind; and that a right use of this figure may have a powerful effect, in fabulous writing especially, to engage our sympathy in behalf of things as well as persons: for nothing can give lasting delight to a moral being, but that which awakens sympathy, and touches the heart; and though it be true that we sympathize in some degree even with inanimate things, yet what has, or is supposed to have, life, calls forth a more sincere and more permanent fellow-feeling.\u2014Let it be observed further, that to awaken such sympathetic feelings, a lively conception of their object is necessary. This indeed is true of almost all our emotions; their keenness is in proportion\nportion to the vivacity of the perceptions that excite them. Distress that we feel is more affecting than what we only hear of; a perusal of the gayest scenes in a comedy does not rouse the mind so effectually as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a cheerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>; and the death of a friend is of greater energy in producing ferociousness, and the consideration of our latter end, than all the pathos of Young.\n\nOf descriptions addressed to the fancy, those that are most vivid and picturesque will generally be found to have the most powerful influence over our affections; and those that exhibit persons engaged in action, and adorned with visible insignia, give a brisker impulse to the faculties than such as convey intellectual ideas only, or images taken from still life. No abstraction notion of time, or of love, can be so striking to the fancy as the image of an old man accoutred with a scythe, or of a beautiful boy with wings and a bow and arrows: and no physiological account of frenzy could suggest so vivid an idea as the poet has given us in that exquisite portrait,\n\nAnd moody madness laughing wild amid feverest wo.\n\nAnd for this reason partly it is that the epic poet, in order to work the more effectually upon our passions and imagination, refers the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of human conduct, and the vicissitudes of human affairs, to the agency of personified causes; that is, to the machinery of gods and goddesses, angels, demons, magicians, and other powerful beings. And hence, in all sublime poetry, life and motion, with their several modes and attributes, are liberally bestowed on those objects wherewith the author intends that we should be strongly impressed: scenes perfectly inanimate and still, tending rather to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUOR\">languor</a> over the mind than to communicate to our internal powers those lively energies without which a being essentially active can never receive complete gratification.\n\nLastly, some violent passions are peculiarly inclined to change things into persons. The horrors of his mind haunted Orestes in the shape of furies. Conscience, in the form of the murdered person, stares the murderer in the face, and often terrifies him to distraction. The superstitious man, travelling alone in the dark, mistakes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> stone for a ghost, a bush for a demon, a tree waving with the wind for an enormous giant brandishing a hundred arms. The lunatic and enthusiast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with persons who exist only in their own distempered fancy; and the glutton and the miser, if they were to give utterance to all their thoughts, would often, it is probable, speak, the one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, the other of his belly, not only as a person, but as a god,\u2014the object of his warmest love and most devout regard.\u2014More need not be said to prove that personification is natural, and may frequently contribute to the pathos, energy, and beauty of poetic language.\n\nApotrophe, or a sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a> of speech from one person to another person or thing, is a figure nearly related to the former. Poets sometimes make use of it, in order to help out their verse, or merely to give variety to their style: but on these occasions it is to be considered as rather a trick of art, than an effort of nature. It is most natural, and most pathetic, when the person or thing to whom the apotrophe is made, and for whose sake we give a new direction to our speech, is in our eyes eminently distinguished for good or evil, or raises within us some sudden and powerful emotion, such as the hearer would acquiesce in, or at least acknowledge to be reasonable. But this, like the other pathetic figures, must be used with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>. For if, instead of calling forth the hearer's sympathy, it should only betray the levity of the speaker, or such wanderings of his mind as neither the subject nor the occasion would lead one to expect, it will then create disgust instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>. The orator, therefore, must not attempt the passionate apostrophe, till the minds of the hearers be prepared to join in it. And every audience is not equally obsequious in this respect. In the forum of ancient Rome that would have passed for sublime and pathetic, which in the most respectable British auditoriums would appear ridiculous. For our style of public speaking is cool and argumentative; and partakes less of enthusiasm than the Roman did, and much less than the modern French or Italian. Of British eloquence, particularly that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a>, the chief recommendations are gravity and simplicity. And it is vain to say, that our oratory ought to be more vehement; for that matter depends on causes, which it is not only inexpedient, but impossible to alter; namely, on the character and spirit of the people, and their rational notions in regard to religion, policy, and literature. The exclamations of Cicero would weigh but little in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>; and many of those which we meet with in French sermons would not be more effectual if attempted in our pulpit. To see one of our preachers, who the moment before was a cool reasoner, a temperate speaker, an humble Christian, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a> divine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out into a sudden apostrophe to the immortal powers, or to the walls of the church, tends to force a smile, rather than a tear, from those among us who reflect, that there is nothing in the subject, and should be nothing in the orator, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> such wanderings of fancy or vehemence of emotion. If he be careful to cultivate a pure style, and a grave and graceful utterance, a British clergyman, who speaks from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> the plain unaffected words of truth and soberness, of benevolence and piety, will, it is believed, convey more pathetic, as well as more permanent, impressions to the heart, and be more useful as a Christian teacher, than if he were to put in practice all the attitudes of Roscius, and all the tropes and figures of Cicero.\n\nBut where the language of passion and enthusiasm is permitted to display itself, whatever raises any strong emotion, whether it be animated or inanimate, absent or present, sensible or intellectual, may give rise to the apostrophe. A man in a distant country, speaking of the place of his birth, might naturally exclaim, \"O my dear native land, shall I never see thee more!\" Or, when some great misfortune befalls him, \"Happy are ye, O my parents, that ye are not alive to see this.\" We have a beautiful apostrophe in the third book of the \u00c6neid, where \u00c6neas, who is telling his story to Dido, happening to mention the death of his father, makes a sudden address to him as follows:\n\nhic, pelagi tot tempestatibus agas,\nHeu, genitorem, omnis curae causique levamen,\nAmitto Anchilien:\u2014hic me, pater optime, fellum\nDeferis, heu, tantis nequiquam crepte periculis!\n\nThis apostrophe has a pleasing effect. It seems to intimate, that the love which the hero bore his father was so great, that when he mentioned him he forgot every thing\nthing else; and, without minding his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, one of whom was a queen, suddenly addressed himself to that which, though present only in idea, was still a principal object of his affection. An emotion so warm and so reasonable cannot fail to command the sympathy of the reader.\u2014When Michael, in the eleventh book of Paradise Lost, announces to Adam and Eve the necessity of their immediate departure from the garden of Eden, the poet's art in preserving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORUM\">decorum</a> of the two characters is very remarkable. Pierced to the heart at the thought of leaving that happy place, Eve, in all the violence of ungovernable sorrow, breaks forth into a pathetic apostrophe to Paradise, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> she had reared, and to the nuptial bower she had adorned. Adam makes no address to the walks, the trees, or the flowers of the garden, the lofs whereof did not so much afflict him; but, in his reply to the Archangel, expresses, without a figure, his regret for being banished from a place where he had been so often honoured with a sensible manifestation of the divine presence. The use of the apostrophe in the one case, and the omission of it in the other, not only gives a beautiful variety to the style, but also marks that superior elevation and composure of mind, by which the poet had all along distinguished the character of Adam.\u2014One of the finest applications of this figure that is anywhere to be seen, is in the fourth book of the same poem; where the author, catching by sympathy the devotion of our first parents, suddenly drops his narrative, and joins his voice to theirs in adoring the Father of the universe.\n\nThus at their shady lodge arriv'd, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>,\nBoth turn'd, and under open sky ador'd\nThe God that made both sky, air, earth, and heav'n,\nWhich they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,\nAnd starry pole:\u2014Thou also mad'it the night,\nMaker omnipotent! and thou the day,\nWhich we in our appointed work employ'd\nHave finish'd.\n\nMilton took the hint of this fine contrivance from a well-known passage of Virgil:\n\nHic juvenum chorus, ille fenum; qui carmine laudes\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> et facta ferant;\nut duros mille labores\nRege sub Eurytseo, fatis Junonis inique,\nFertulerit:\u2014Tu nubigenas, invicte, bismembr\u00e6,\nHylaeumque, Pholumque manu, tu Crehae maetas\nProdigia.\n\nThe beauty arising from diversified composition is the same in both, and very great in each. But every reader must feel, that the figure is incomparably more affecting to the mind in the imitation than in the original. So true it is, that the most rational emotions raise the most intense fellow-feeling; and that the apostrophe is then the most emphatical, when it displays those workings of human affection which are at once ardent and well-founded.\n\nTo conclude this head: Tropes and figures, particularly the metaphor, similitude, and allegory, are further useful in beautifying language, by suggesting, together with the thoughts essential to the subject, an endless variety of agreeable images, for which there would be no place, if writers were always to confine themselves to the proper names of things. And this beauty and variety, judiciously applied, is so far from distracting, that it tends rather to fix the attention, and captivate the heart of the readers, by giving light, and life, and pathos, to the whole composition.\n\nII. That tropes and figures are more necessary to poetry, than to any other mode of writing, was the second point proposed to be illustrated in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>.\n\nLanguage, as already observed, is then natural, when Tropes and it is suitable to the supposed condition of the speaker. Figurative language is peculiarly suitable to the supposed condition of the poet; because figures are suggested by the fancy; and the fancy of him who composes poetry is more employed than that of any other author. Of all historical, philosophical, and theological researches, the object is real truth, which is fixed and permanent. The aim of rhetorical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> (according to Cicero) is apparent truth; which, being less determinate, leaves the fancy of the speaker more free, gives greater scope to the inventive powers, and supplies the materials of a more figurative phraseology. But the poet is subject to no restraints, but those of verisimilitude; which is still less determinate than rhetorical truth. He seeks not to convince the judgment of his reader by arguments of either real or apparent cogency; he means only to please and interest him, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to his sensibility and imagination. His own imagination is therefore continually at work, ranging through the whole of real and probable existence, \"glancing from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,\" in quest of images and ideas suited to the emotions he himself feels, and to the sympathies he would communicate to others. And, consequently, figures of speech, the offspring of excursive fancy, must (if he speak according to what he is supposed to think and feel, that is, according to his supposed condition) tincture the language of the poet more than that of any other composer. So that, if figurative diction be unnatural in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, because all wanderings of fancy are unsuitable, and even impossible, to the geometrician, while intent upon his argument; it is, upon the same principle, perfectly natural, and even unavoidable, in poetry; because the more a poet attends to his subject, and the better qualified he is to do it justice, the more active will his imagination be, and the more diversified the ideas that present themselves to his mind.\u2014Besides, the true poet addresses himself to the passions and sympathies of mankind; which, till his own be raised, he cannot hope to do with success. And it is the nature of many passions, though not of all, to increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of imagination: and an active imagination naturally vents itself in figurative language; nay, unless restrained by a correct taste, has a tendency to exceed in it; of which Bishop Taylor and Lord Verulam, two geniuses different in kind, but of the highest order, are memorable examples.\n\nWe said, that \"the poet seeks not to convince the judgment of his reader by arguments of either real or apparent cogency.\"\u2014We do not mean, that in poetry argument has no place. The most legitimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, the profoundest philosophy, and narratives purely historical, may appear in a poem, and contribute greatly to the honour of the author, and to the importance of his work. All this we have in Paradise Lost. We mean, that what distinguishes pure poetry from other writing, is its aptitude, not to sway the judgment by reasoning,\nOf poetical foning, but to please the fancy, and move the passions, by Harmony.\na lively imitation of nature. Nor would we exclude poet-\nical embellishment from history, or even from philosophy.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s Dialogues and the Moral Essays of Addison\nand Johnson abound in poetical imagery; and Livy and Tacitus often amuse their readers with poetical descrip-\ntion. In like manner, though geometry and physics be\ndifferent sciences; though abstract ideas be the subject,\nand pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTUITION\">intuition</a> the evidence, of the\nformer; and though the material universe, and the im-\nformations of sense, be the subject and the evidence of\nthe latter; yet have these sciences been united by the\nbest philosophers, and very happy effects resulted from\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>.\u2014In one and the same work, poetry, histo-\nry, philosophy, and oratory, may doubtless be blended;\nnay, these arts have all been actually blended in one and\nthe same work, not by Milton only, but also by Ho-\nmer, Virgil, Lucan, and Shakespeare. Yet still these\narts are different; different in their ends and principles,\nand in the faculties of the mind to which they are re-\nspectively addressed: and it is easy to perceive when a\nwriter employs one and when another.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of the SOUND of Poetical Language.\n\nAs the ear, like every other perceptive faculty, is\ncapable of gratification, regard is to be had to the found\nof words, even in prose. But to the harmony of lan-\nguage, it behoves the poet, more than any other writer,\nto attend; as it is more especially his concern to render\nhis work pleasurable. In fact, we find, that no poet was\never popular who did not possess the art of harmonious\ncomposition.\n\nWhat belongs to the subject of Poetical Harmony\nmay be referred to one or other of these heads, Sweet-\nness, Measure, and Imitation.\n\nI. In order to give sweetness to language, either in\nverse or prose, all words of harsh sound, difficult pro-\nnunciation, or unwieldy magnitude, are to be avoided as\nmuch as possible, unless when they have in the sound\nsomething peculiarly emphatic; and words are to be so\nplaced in respect of one another, as that discordant\ncombinations may not result from their union. But in\npoetry this is more necessary than in prose; poetical\nlanguage being understood to be an imitation of natural\nlanguage improved to that perfection which is consistent\nwith probability. To poetry, therefore, a greater lati-\ntude must be allowed than to prose, in expressing, by\ntropes and figures of pleasing sound, those ideas whereof\nthe proper names are in any respect offensive, either to\nthe ear or to the fancy.\n\nII. How far verification or regular measure may be\nessential to this art, has been disputed by critical writers;\nsome holding it to be indispensible necessary, and some\nnot necessary at all.\n\nThe fact seems to be, as already hinted, that to poe-\ntry verse is not essential. In a prose work, we may\nhave the fable, the arrangement, and a great deal of the\npathos and language, of poetry; and such a work is cer-\ntainly a poem, though perhaps not a perfect one. For\nhow absurd would it be to say, that by changing the\nposition only of a word or two in each line, one might\ndivest Homer's Iliad of its poetical character! At this\nrate, the arts of poetry and verification would be the\nsame; and the rules in Defrater's Grammar, and the\nmoral duties ascribed to Cato, would be as real poetry\nas any part of Virgil. In fact, some very ancient poems,\nwhen translated into a modern tongue, are far less poet-\nical in verse than in prose; the alterations necessary to\nadapt them to our numbers being detrimental to their\nsublime simplicity; of which any person of taste will be\nsensible, who compares our common prose version of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a>, the Psalms, and the Song of Solomon, with the\nbest metrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">paraphrase</a> of those books that has yet ap-\npeared. Nay, in many cases, Comedy will be more\npoetical, because more pleasing and natural, in prose\nthan in verse. By verifying Tom Jones, and The\nMerry Wives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>, we should spoil the two finest\ncomic poems, the one epic, the other dramatical, now in\nthe world.\n\nBut, secondly, though verse be not essential to poetry, adds\nit is necessary to the perfection of all poetry that admits the perfe-\ntion of it. Verse is to poetry, what colours are to paint-\ning (c). A painter might display great genius, and\ndraw masterly figures with chalk or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>; but if he in-\ntend a perfect picture, he must employ in his work as\nmany colours as are seen in the object he imitates. Or,\nto adopt a beautiful comparison of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a>, quoted\nby Aristotle*, \"Verification is to poetry what bloom is to\nthe human countenance.\" A good face is agreeable\nwhen the bloom is gone, and good poetry may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRI\">capri</a>-\ncious without verification; harmonious numbers may\nlet off an indifferent poem, and a fine bloom indifferent\nfeatures: but, without verse, poetry is incomplete; and\nbeauty is not perfect, unless sweetness and regularity\nof feature there be superadded.\n\nThe bloom of young desire, and purple light of love.\n\nIf numbers be necessary to the perfection of the higher\npoetry, they are no less so to that of the lower kinds, to\nPastoral, Song, and Satire, which have little besides the\nlanguage and verification to distinguish them from prose;\nand which some ancient authors are unwilling to admit to\nthe rank of poems: though it seems too nice a scruple,\nboth because such writings are commonly termed poet-\nical; and also because there is, even in them, something\nthat may not improperly be considered as an imitation of\nnature.\n\nThat the rhythm and measure of verse are naturally\nagreeable, and therefore that by these poetry may be\nmade more pleasing than it would be without them, is\nevident from this, that children and illiterate people,\nwhose admiration we cannot suppose to be the effect of\nhabit or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, are exceedingly delighted with them.\nIn many proverbial sayings, where there is neither rhyme\nnor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLITERATION\">alliteration</a>, rhythm is obviously studied. Nay, the\nuse of rhythm in poetry is universal; whereas alliteration\n\n(c) Horace seems to hint at the same comparison, when, after specifying the several sorts of verse suitable to\nEpic, Elegiac, Lyric, and Dramatic Poetry, he adds,\n\nDefcriptas servare vices, operumque colores.\nCur ego, si nequeo ignoroque, Poeta salutor?\nAr. Poet. ver. 86.\nOf poetical and rhyme, though relished by some nations, are not much sought after by others. And we need not be at a loss to account for the agreeableness of proportion and order, if we reflect, that they suggest the agreeable ideas of contrivance and skill, at the same time that they render the connection of things obvious to the understanding, and imprint it deeply on the memory. Verse, by promoting distinct and easy remembrance, conveys ideas to the mind with energy, and enlivens every emotion the poet intends to raise in the reader or hearer. Besides, when we attend to verses, after hearing one or two, we become acquainted with the measure, which, therefore, we always look for in the sequel. This perpetual interchange of hope and gratification is a source of delight; and to this in part is owing the pleasure we take in the rhymes of modern poetry. And hence we see, that though an incorrect rhyme or untuneable verse be in itself, and compared with an important sentiment, a very trifling matter; yet it is no trifle in regard to its effects on the hearer; because it brings disappointment, and so gives a temporary shock to the mind, and interrupts the current of the affections; and because it suggests the disagreeable ideas of negligence or want of skill on the part of the author. And therefore, as the public ear becomes more delicate, the negligence will be more glaring, and the disappointment more intensely felt; and correctness of rhyme and of measure will of course be the more indispensible. In our tongue, rhyme is more necessary to Lyric than to Heroic poetry. The reason seems to be, that in the latter the ear can of itself perceive the boundary of the measure, because the lines are all of equal length nearly, and every good reader makes a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a> at the end of each; whereas, in the former, the lines vary in length; and therefore the rhyme is requisite to make the measure and rhythm sufficiently perceptible. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">Custom</a> too may have some influence. English Odes without rhyme are uncommon; and therefore have something awkward about them, or something at least to which the public ear is not yet thoroughly reconciled. Indeed, when the drama is excepted, we do not think that rhyme can be safely spared from English poetry of any kind, but when the subject is able to support itself. \"He that thinks himself capable of astonishing (says Johnson) may write blank verse; but those that hope only to please, must confine themselves to rhyme.\"\n\nRhyme, however, is of less importance by far than rhythm, which in poetry as well as in music is the source of much pleasing variety; of variety tempered with uniformity, and regulated by art; insomuch that, notwithstanding the likeness of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEXAMETER\">hexameter</a> verse to another, it is not common, either in Virgil or Homer, to meet with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> hexameters whose rhythm is exactly the same. And though all English heroic verses consist of five feet, among which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IAMBIC\">iambic</a> predominates; yet this measure, in respect of rhythm alone, is susceptible of more than 30 varieties. And let it be remarked further, that different kinds of verse, by being adapted to different subjects and modes of writing, give variety to the poetic language, and multiply the charms of this pleasing art.\n\nWhat has formerly been shown to be true in regard to style, will also in many cases hold true of versification, \"that it is then natural when it is adapted to the supposed condition of the speaker.\"\u2014In the epopee the poet assumes the character of calm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>; and therefore his language must be elevated, and his numbers majestic and uniform. A peasant speaking in heroic or hexameter verse is no improbability here; but the language of the who will of his own accord give them every ornament necessary to reduce them into dignified measure; as an eloquent man, in a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, recapitulating the speech of a clown, would naturally express it in pure uniformly and perspicuous language. The uniform heroic measure will suit any subject of dignity, whether narrative or didactic, that admits or requires uniformity of style. In tragedy, where the imitation of real life is more perfect than in epic poetry, the uniform magnificence of epic numbers might be improper; because the heroes and heroines are supposed to speak in their own persons, and according to the immediate impulse of passion and sentiment. Yet, even in tragedy, the versification may be both harmonious and dignified; because the same characters are taken chiefly from high life, and the uniform events from a remote period; and because the higher cence poetry is permitted to imitate nature, not as it is, but would be in that state of perfection in which it might be. The improper, Greeks and Romans considered their hexameter as too artificial for dramatic poetry; and therefore in tragedy, and even in comedy, made use of the iambic, and some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> that came near the cadence of conversation: we use the iambic both in the epic and dramatic poem; but for the most part it is, or ought to be, much more elaborate in the former than in the latter. In dramatic comedy, where the manners and concerns of familiar life are exhibited, verse would seem to be unnatural, except it be so like the sound of common discourse as to be hardly distinguishable from it. Custom, however, may in some countries determine otherwise; and against custom, in these matters, it is vain to argue. The professed enthusiasm of the dithyrambic poet renders wildness, variety, and a sonorous harmony of numbers, peculiarly suitable to his odes. The love-sonnet, and Anacreontic song, will be less various, more regular, and of a softer harmony; because the state of mind expressed in it has more composure. Philosophy can scarce go farther in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, without deviating into whims and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The particular sorts of verse to be adopted in the lower species of poetry, are determined by fashion chiefly, and the practice of approved authors.\n\nIII. The origin and principles of imitative harmony, or that artifice by which the sound is made, as Pope says, \"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> to the sense,\" may be explained in the following manner.\n\nIt is pleasing to observe the uniformity of nature in all her operations. Between moral and material beauty and harmony, between moral and material deformity and dissonance, there obtains a very striking analogy. The visible and audible expressions of almost every virtuous emotion are agreeable to the eye and the ear, and those of almost every criminal passion disagreeable. The looks, the attitudes, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOCAL\">vocal</a> sounds, natural to benevolence, to gratitude, to compassion, to piety, are in themselves graceful and pleasing; while anger, discontent, despair, and cruelty, bring discord to the voice, deformity to the features, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTORTION\">distortion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>. That flowing curve, which painters know to be essential to the beauty of animal shape, gives place to a multiplicity\nOf poetical simplicity of right lines and sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> in the countenance and gesture of him who knits his brows, stretches his nostrils, grinds his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and clenches his fist; whereas, devotion, magnanimity, benevolence, contentment, and good-humour, soften the attitude, and give a more graceful swell to the outline of every feature. Certain vocal tones accompany certain mental emotions. The voice of sorrow is feeble and broken, that of despair boisterous and incoherent; joy affumes a sweet and sprightly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, fear a weak and tremulous cadence; the tones of love and benevolence are musical and uniform, those of rage loud and dissonant; the voice of the sedate reasoner is equable and grave, but not unpleasing; and he who declaims with energy, employs many varieties of modulation suited to the various emotions that predominate in his discourse.\n\nBut it is not in the language of passion only that the human voice varies its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a>, or the human face its features. Every striking sentiment, and every interesting idea, has an effect upon it. One would esteem that person no adept in narrative eloquence, who should describe, with the very same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a>, swift and slow motion, extreme labour and easy performance, agreeable sensation and excruciating pain; who should talk of the tumult of a tempestuous ocean, the roar of thunder, the devastations of an earthquake, or an Egyptian pyramid tumbling into ruins, in the same tone of voice wherein he describes the murmur of a rill, the warbling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a> of \u00c6olus, the swinging of a cradle, or the descent of an angel. Elevation of mind gives dignity to the voice. From Achilles, Sarpedon, and Othello, we should as naturally expect a manly and forcible accent, as a nervous style and majestic attitude. Coxcombs and bullies, while they affume <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> of importance and valour, affect also a dignified articulation.\n\nSince the tones of natural language are so various, poetry, which imitates the language of nature, must allow its tones; and, in respect of sound as well as meaning, be framed after that model of ideal perfection, which the variety and energy of the human articulate voice render probable. This is the more easily accomplished, because in every language there is between the sound and sense of certain words a perceptible analogy; which, though not so accurate as to lead a foreigner from the sound to the signification, is yet accurate enough to show, that, in forming such words, regard has been had to the imitative qualities of vocal sound. Such, in English, are the words yell, crash, crack, hiss, roar, murmur, and many others.\n\nAll the particular laws that regulate this sort of imitation, as far as they are founded in nature, and liable to the cognizance of philosophy, depend on the general law of style above mentioned. Together with the other circumstances of the supposed speaker, the poet takes into consideration the tone of voice suitable to the ideas that occupy his mind, and thereto adapts the sound of his language, if it can be done consistently with ease and elegance of expression. But when this imitative harmony is too much sought after, or words appear to be chosen for sound rather than sense, the verse becomes finical and ridiculous. Such is Ronfard's affected imitation of the song of the fly-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LARK\">lark</a>:\n\nElle quind\u00e9e du zephyre\nSublime en l'air <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRE\">vire</a> et revire,\nEt y d\u00e9clique un joli cris,\nQui rit, gu\u00e9rit, et tire l'ire\nDes esprits mieux que je n'\u00e9cris.\n\nThis is as ridiculous as that line of Ennius,\n\nTum tuba terribili sonitu tarantanta dixit:\n\nOr as the following verses of Swift;\n\nThe man with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KETTLE\">kettle</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUM\">drum</a> enters the gate,\nDub dub a dub dub: the trumpeters follow,\nTaranta taranta; while all the boys hollow.\n\nWords by their sound may imitate sound; and quick or slow articulation may imitate quick or slow motion. Hence, by a proper choice and arrangement of words, the poet may imitate Sounds that are sweet with dignity (H),\u2014sweet and tender (I),\u2014loud (K),\u2014and harsh (L);\u2014and Motions that are slow, in consequence of dignity (M),\u2014flow in consequence of difficulty (N),\u2014swift.\n\nSee also the storm in the first book of the \u00c6neid, and in the fifth of the Odyssey.\n\nThe hoarse rough verse should like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> roar.\n\nOn a sudden open fly,\nWith impetuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> and jarring sound,\nTh' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate\nHarsh thunder.\n\nSee also Homer's Iliad, lib. ii. ver. 363, and Clarke's Annotation.\n\nSee an exquisite example in Gray's Progress of Poetry; the conclusion of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STANZA\">stanza</a>.\n\nAnd when up ten steep slopes you've dragged your thighs.\n\nJust brought out this, when scarce his tongue could stir.\n\nThe huge leviathan\nWallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,\nTempest the ocean.\n\nPar. Loft, vii. 411.\nOf poetical swift and noisy (o)\u2014swift and smooth (p)\u2014uneven and abrupt (q),\u2014quick and joyous (r). An unexpected pause in the verse may also imitate a sudden failure of strength (s), or interruption of motion (t), or give vivacity to an image or thought, by fixing our attention longer than usual upon the word that precedes it (u).\u2014Moreover, when we describe great bulk, it is natural for us to articulate slowly, even in common discourse; and therefore a line of poetry that requires a slow pronunciation, or seems longer than it should be, may be used with good effect in describing vastness of size (x).\u2014Sweet and smooth numbers are most proper, when the poet paints agreeable objects, or gentle energy (y); and harsher sounds when he speaks of what is ugly, violent, or disagreeable (z). This too is according to the nature of common language; for we generally employ harsher tones of voice to express what we dislike, and more melodious notes to describe the objects of love, complacency, or admiration. Harsh numbers, however, should not be frequent in poetry: for in this art, as in music, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> ought always to predominate. And we find in fact, that good poets can occasionally express themselves somewhat harshly, when the subject requires it, and yet preserve the sweetness and majesty of poetical diction. Further, the voice of complaint, pity, love, and all the gentler affections, is mild and musical, and should therefore be imitated in musical numbers; while despair, defiance, revenge, and turbulent emotions in general, assume an abrupt and sonorous cadence. Dignity of description (a), solemn vows (b), and all sentiments that proceed from a mind elevated with great ideas (c), require a correspond-\n\nSee the famous description of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SISYPHUS\">Sisyphus</a> rolling the stone, Odyss. lib. xii. ver. 592.

Virgil, describing horses running over rocky heights at full speed, begins the line with two dactyls, to imitate rapidity, and concludes it with eight long syllables:\n\nSaxa per, et icopulos, et depressas convalles.\n\n*Georg.* iii. 276.\n\nwhich is very unusual measure, but seems well adapted to the thing expressed, namely, to the descent of the animal from the hills to the low ground. At any rate, this extraordinary change of the rhythm may be allowed to bear some resemblance to the animal's change of motion, as it would be felt by a rider, and as we may suppose it is felt by the animal itself.\n\nOther forms of imitative harmony, and many other examples, besides those referred to in the margin, will readily occur to all who are conversant in the writings of the best versifiers; particularly Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lucretius, Spenser, Dryden, Shakespeare, Pope, and Gray.\n\nPart II. Of the Different Species of Poetry, with their Particular Principles.\n\nSect. I. Of Epic and Dramatic Compositions.\n\n\u00a7 1. The Epopee and Drama compared.\n\nTRAGEDY and the epic differ not in substantial things in both the same ends are proposed, viz. instruction and amusement; and in both the same mean is employed, viz. imitation of human actions. They differ only in the manner of imitating; epic poetry employs narration; tragedy represents its facts as passing in our sight; in the former, the poet introduces himself as an historian; in the latter, he presents his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTORS\">actors</a>, and never himself.\n\nThis difference, regarding form only, may be thought slight; but the effects it occasions are by no means so; for what we see makes a deeper impression than what we learn from others. A narrative poem is a story told by another; facts and incidents passing upon the stage, come under our own observation; and are before much enlivened by action and gesture, expressive of many sentiments beyond the reach of language.\n\nA dramatic composition has another property, independent altogether of action; which is, that it makes a deeper impression than narration; in the former, persons express their own sentiments; in the latter, sentiments are related at second-hand. For that reason, Aristotle, the father of critics, lays it down as a rule*, that in an epic poem the author ought to have every opportunity of introducing his actors, and of confining the narrative part within the narrowest bounds. Homer understood perfectly the advantage of this method; and his poems are both of them in a great measure dramatic. Lucan runs to the opposite extreme; and is guilty of a still greater fault, in stuffing his *Pharsalia* with cold and languid reflections, the merit of which he affirms to himself, and deigns not to share with his actors. Nothing can be more injudiciously timed, than a chain of such reflections, which suspend the battle of Pharsalia, after the leaders had made their speeches, and the two armies are ready to engage\u2020.\n\nAristotle, from the nature of the fable, divides tragedy into simple and complex; but it is of greater moment, with respect to dramatic as well as epic poetry, to find a distinction upon the different ends attained by such compositions. A poem, whether dramatic or epic, that has nothing in view but to move the passions moral, and to exhibit pictures of virtue and vice, may be distinguished by the name of pathetic: but where a story is purposely contrived to illustrate some moral truth, by showing that disorderly passions naturally lead to external misfortunes, such composition may be denominated moral. Before making a deeper impression than can be done by cool reasoning, a moral poem does not fall short of reasoning in affording conviction: the natural connection of vice with misery, and of virtue with happiness, may be illustrated by stating a fact as well as by urging an argument. Let us assume, for example, the following moral truths: That discord among the chiefs renders ineffectual all common measures; and that the consequences of a slightly-founded quarrel, fostered by pride and arrogance, are not less fatal than those of the greatest injury: these truths may be inculcated by the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles at the siege of Troy. If facts or circumstances be wanting, such as tend to rouse the turbulent passions, they must be invented; but no accidental nor unaccountable event ought to be admitted; for the necessary or probable connection between vice and misery is not learned from any events but what are naturally occasioned by the characters and passions of the persons represented, acting in such circumstances. A real event, of which we see not the cause, may afford a lesson, upon the presumption that what hath happened may again happen; but this cannot be inferred from a story that is known to be a fiction.\n\nMany are the good effects of such compositions. A pathetic composition, whether epic or dramatic, tends to a habit of virtue, by exciting us to do what is right, effects of and restraining us from what is wrong. Its frequent pictures of human woes produce, beside, two effects extremely salutary: They improve our sympathy, and fortify us to bear our misfortunes. A moral composition must obviously produce the same good effects because by being moral it ceaseth not to be pathetic: it enjoys besides an excellence peculiar to itself; for it not only improves the heart, as above-mentioned, but instructs the head by the moral it contains. It seems impossible to imagine any entertainment more suited to a rational being, than a work thus happily illustrating some moral truth; where a number of persons of different characters are engaged in an important action, some retarding, others promoting, the great catastrophe; and where there is dignity of style as well as of matter. A work of this kind has our sympathy at command,\nmand, and can put in motion the whole train of the\nsocial affections: our curiosity in some scenes is ex-\ncited, in others gratified; and our delight is consum-\nmated at the close, upon finding, from the characters\nand situations exhibited at the commencement, that\nevery incident down to the final catastrophe is natural,\nand that the whole in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> make a regular chain\nof causes and effects.\n\nConsidering that an epic and a dramatic poem are the\nsame in substance, and have the same aim or end, one\nwill readily imagine, that subjects proper for the one\nmust be equally proper for the other. But considering\ntheir difference as to form, there will be found reason\nto correct that conjecture, at least in some degree.\n\nMany subjects may indeed be treated with equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a>-\nvantage in either form; but the subjects are still more\nnumerous for which they are not equally qualified; and\nthere are subjects proper for the one and not at all for\nthe other. To give some slight notion of the difference,\nas there is no room here for enlarging upon every article,\nwe observe, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> is better qualified for ex-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> sentiments, and narrative for displaying facts.\nHeroism, magnanimity, undaunted courage, and other\nelevated virtues, figure best in action: tender passions,\nand the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of sympathetic affections, figure best\nin sentiment. It clearly follows, that tender passions are\nmore peculiarly the province of tragedy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and hero-\nic actions of epic poetry.\n\n\"The epic poem is universally allowed to be, of all\npoetical works, the most dignified, and, at the same time,\nthe most difficult in execution. To contrive a story which\nshall please and interest all readers, by being at once en-\ntertaining, important, and instructive; to fill it with suit-\nable incidents; to enliven it with a variety of characters\nand descriptions; and, throughout a long work, to main-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> that propriety of sentiment, and that elevation\nof style, which the epic character requires, is unquestion-\nably the highest effort of poetical genius.\n\n\"The action or subject of the epic poem must be great\nand interesting. Without greatness it would not have suf-\nficient importance either to fix our attention or to justify\nthe magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> which the poet bestows on it.\nThis is evidently requisite as not to require illustration;\nand, indeed, hardly any who have attempted epic poetry\nhave failed in choosing some subject sufficiently important,\neither by the nature of the action or by the fame of the\npersonages concerned in it. The fame of Homer's heroes,\nand the consequences of diffusion between the greatest\nof them, is a subject important in itself, and must have\nappeared particularly so to his countrymen, who boasted\ntheir descent from those heroes. The subject of the Aeneid\nis still greater than that of the Iliad, as it is the founda-\ntion of the most powerful empire that ever was establish-\ned upon this globe; an event of much greater import-\nance than the destruction of a city, or the anger of a fe-\nmibarbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>. But the poems of Homer and Vir-\ngil fall in this respect infinitely short of that of Milton.\n\nBefore the greatness displayed in Paradise Lost, it has\nbeen well observed that all other greatness shrinks away.\nThe subject of the English poet is not the destruction of\na city, the conduct of a colony, or the foundation of an\nempire: it is the fate of worlds, the revolutions of hea-\nven and earth; rebellion against the Supreme King, rais-\ned by the highest order of created beings; the overthrow\nof their host, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of their crime; the crea-\ntion of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of reasonable creatures; their original\nhappiness and innocence, their forfeiture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>,\nand their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> to hope and peace.\"\n\nAn epic poem, however, is defective if its action be\nnot interesting as well as great; for a narrative of mere\nvalue may be so constructed as to prove cold and tire-\nsome. \"Much will depend on the happy choice of a\nsubject, which shall by its nature interest the public; as\nwhen the poet selects for his hero one who is the\nfounder, or the deliverer, or the favourite of his na-\ntion; or when he writes achievements that have been\nhighly celebrated, or have been connected with impor-\ntant consequences to any public cause. Most of the great\nepic poems are abundantly fortunate in this respect, and\nmust have been very interesting to those ages in which\nthey were composed.\" The subject of the Paradise Lost,\nas it is infinitely greater, must likewise be considered as\nmore universally interesting than that of any other poem.\n\n\"We all feel the effects of Adam's transgression; we all\nfeel like him, and like him must all bewail our offences.\nWe have reflexts and indignant enemies in the fallen angels,\nand in the blessed spirits we have guardians and friends;\nin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> of mankind we hope to be included;\nin the description of heaven and hell we are surely inte-\nrested, as we are all to reside hereafter either in the regions\nof horror or bliss.\"\n\n\"The chief circumstance which renders an epic poem cir-\ncumstances, and which tends to interest not one age or\ncountry alone, but all readers, is the skilful conduct of the\nauthor in the management of his subject. His plan of epic poetry,\nmust comprehend many affecting incidents. He may sometimes be\nawful and august; he must often be tender and pathetic; he must\ngive us gentle and pleasing scenes of love, friendship, and affection.\nThe more that an epic poem abounds with situations which awaken the\nfeelings of humanity, it is the more interesting. In this\nrespect perhaps no epic poets have been so happy as Vir-\ngil and Tasso. The plan of the Paradise Lost comprises\nneither human actions nor human manners. The man\nand woman who act and suffer, are in a state which no\nother man or woman can ever know. The reader finds\nno transaction in which he can be engaged; beholds no\ncondition in which he can by any effort of imagination\nplace himself; he has therefore little natural curiosity or\nsympathy.\"\n\nA question has been moved, Whether the nature of the\nepic poem does not require that the hero should be\nultimately successful? To this question <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOHNSTONE\">Johnstone</a> replies,\nthat \"there is no reason why the hero should not be\nsuccessful, except established practice, since success and\nvirtue do not necessarily go together.\" Most critics,\nhowever, are of a different opinion, and hold success to\nbe, if not the necessary, at least the most proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of\nan epic poem. An unhappy conclusion depresses the\nmind, and is opposite to the elevating emotions which\nbelong to this species of poetry. Terror and compassion\nare the proper subjects of tragedy; but as the epic is of\nlarger extent, it were too much, if, after the difficulties\nand troubles which commonly abound in the progress of\nthe poem, the author should bring them all at last to an\nunfortunate conclusion. We know not that any author\nof name has held this course except Lucan; for in the\nParadise Lost, as Adam's deceiver is at last crushed, and\nhe himself restored to the favour of his maker, Milton's\nhero must be considered as finally successful.\nWe have no occasion to say more of the epic, considered as peculiarly adapted to certain subjects, and to be conducted according to a certain plan. But as dramatic subjects are more complex, it is necessary to take a narrower view of them. They are either the light and the gay, or the grave and affecting, incidents of human life. The former constitute the subject of comedy, and the latter of tragedy.\n\nAs great and serious objects command more attention than little and ludicrous ones; as the fall of a hero interests the public more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> of a private person; tragedy has been always held a more dignified entertainment than comedy. The first thing required of the tragic poet is, that he pitch upon some moving and interesting story, and that he conduct it in a natural and probable manner. For we must observe, that the natural and probable are more essential to tragic than even to epic poetry. Admiration is excited by the wonderful; but passion can be raised only by the impressions of nature and truth upon the mind.\n\nThe subject best fitted for tragedy is where a man has himself been the cause of his misfortune; not so as to be deeply guilty, nor altogether innocent: the misfortune must be occasioned by a fault incident to human nature, and therefore in some degree venial. Such misfortunes call forth the social affections, and warmly interest the spectator. An accidental misfortune, if not extremely singular, doth not greatly move our pity: the person who suffers, being innocent, is freed from the greatest of all torments, that anguish of mind which is occasioned by remorse. An atrocious criminal, on the other hand, who brings misfortunes upon himself, excites little pity, for a different reason: his remorse, it is true, aggravates his distress, and swells the first emotions of pity; but then our hatred of him as a criminal blending with pity, blunts its edge considerably. Misfortunes that are not innocent, nor highly criminal, partake the advantages of each extreme: they are attended with remorse to embitter the distress, which raises our pity to a great height; and the slight indignation we have at a venial fault detracts not sensibly from our pity. The happiest of all subjects accordingly for raising pity, is where a man of integrity falls into a great misfortune by doing an action that is innocent, but which, by some singular means, is conceived by him to be criminal: his remorse aggravates his distress; and our compassion, unrestrained by indignation, knows no bounds. Pity comes thus to be the ruling passion of a pathetic tragedy; and, by proper representation, may be raised to a height scarcely exceeded by any thing felt in real life. A moral tragedy takes in a larger field; as it not only exercises our pity, but raises another passion, which, though selfish, deserves to be cherished equally with the social affection. The passion we have in view is fear or terror; for when a misfortune is the natural consequence of some wrong bias in the temper, every spectator who is conscious of such a bias in himself takes the alarm, and dreads his falling into the same misfortune: and by the emotion of fear or terror, frequently reiterated in a variety of moral tragedies, the spectators are put upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the disorders of passion.\n\nThe commentators upon Aristotle, and other critics, have been much grappled about the account given of tragedy by that author: \"That by means of pity and terror, it refines or purifies in us all sorts of passion.\" But no one who has a clear conception of the end and effects of a good tragedy, can have any difficulty about Aristotle's meaning: our pity is engaged for the persons represented; and our terror is upon our own account. Pity indeed is here made to stand for all the sympathetic emotions, because of these it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. There can be no doubt, that our sympathetic emotions are refined or improved by daily exercise; and in what manner our other passions are refined by terror, has been just now said. One thing is certain, that no other meaning can justly be given to the foregoing doctrine than that now mentioned; and that it was really Aristotle's meaning, appears from his 13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, where he delivers several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> conformable to the doctrine as here explained. There, at the same time, we take liberty to mention; because, so far as authority can go, they confirm the foregoing reasoning about subjects proper for tragedy. The first proposition is, That it being the province of tragedy to excite pity and terror, an innocent person falling into adversity ought never to be the subject. This proposition is a necessary consequence of his doctrine as explained; a subject of that nature may indeed excite pity and terror; but the former in an inferior degree, and the latter in no degree for moral instruction. The second proposition is, That the history of a wicked person in a change from misery to happiness ought not to be represented; which excites neither terror nor compasion, nor is agreeable in any respect. The third is, That the misfortunes of a wicked person ought not to be represented: such representation may be agreeable in some measure upon a principle of justice; but it will not move our pity, or any degree of terror, except in those of the same vicious disposition with the person represented. The last proposition is, That the only character fit for representation lies in the middle, neither eminently good nor eminently bad; where the misfortune is not the effect of deliberate vice, but of some involuntary fault, as our author expresses it. The only objection we find to Aristotle's account of tragedy, is, that he confines it within too narrow bounds, by refusing admittance to the pathetic kind: for if terror be essential to tragedy, no representation deserves that name but the moral kind, where the misfortunes exhibited are caused by a wrong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of mind, or some disorder in the internal constitution: such misfortunes always suggest moral instruction; and by such misfortunes only can terror be excited for our improvement.\n\nThus Aristotle's four propositions above-mentioned relate solely to tragedies of the moral kind. Those of the pathetic kind are not confined within so narrow limits: subjects fitted for the theatre are not in such plenty as to make us reject innocent misfortunes which rouse our sympathy, though they inculcate no moral. With respect indeed to the subjects of that kind, it may be doubted, whether the conclusion ought not always to be fortunate. Where a person of integrity is represented as suffering to the end under misfortunes purely accidental, we depart discontented, and with some obscure sense of injustice: for seldom is man so submissive to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, as not to revolt against the tyranny and vexations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> chance; he will be tempted to say, this ought not to be. We give for an example the Romeo and Juliet of Shakespeare, where the fatal catastrophe is occasioned by Friar Lawrence's coming to the monument a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> too late; we are vexed at the unlucky chance, and go away dissatisfied. Such impres-\nThe misfortunes of a virtuous person, arising from necessary causes, or a chain of unavoidable circumstances, as they excite a notion of destiny, are equally unsatisfactory to the human mind. A metaphysician in his closet may reason himself into the belief of fate, or what in modern language is called philosophical necessity; but the feelings of the heart revolt against that doctrine; and we have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a> of the two ablest philosophers by whom it was ever maintained, that men conduct themselves through life as if their will were absolutely free, and their actions no part of a chain of necessary causes and effects. As no man goes to the theatre to study <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, or to divest himself of the common feelings of humanity, it is impossible, whatever be his philosophical creed, that he should contemplate without horror and disgust an innocent person suffering by mere destiny.\n\nA tragedy of uncommon merit in every other respect may indeed be endured, nay perhaps admired, though such be its catastrophe; because no work of man was ever perfect; and because, where imperfections are unavoidable, a multitude of excellencies may be allowed to cover one fault: but we believe the misery of an innocent person resulting from a chain of unavoidable circumstances has never been considered as a beauty by minds unperverted by a false philosophy. \"It must be acknowledged\" that the subjects of the ancient Greek tragedies were frequently founded on mere destiny and inevitable misfortunes. In the course of the drama many moral sentiments occurred; but the only intuition which the fable conveyed was, that reverence was due to the gods, and submission to the decrees of fate. Modern tragedy has aimed at a higher object, by becoming more the theatre of passion; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out to men the consequences of their own misconduct, showing the direful effects which ambition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, love, resentment, and other such strong emotions, when misguided or left unrestrained, produce upon human life. An Othello, hurried by jealousy to murder his innocent wife; a Jafer enraged by resentment and want to engage in a conspiracy, and then flung with remorse and involved in ruin; a Siffredi, through the deceit which he employs for public-spirited ends, bringing destruction on all whom he loved; these, and such as these, are the examples which Tragedy now displays to public view; and by means of which it inculcates on men the proper government of their passions.\"\n\nThere is indeed one singular drama, in which destiny is employed in a manner very different from that in which it was used by the poets of Greece and Rome. It is Schiller's tragedy of the Robbers, of which \"the hero endowed by nature (as the translator of the piece observes) with the most generous feelings, animated by the highest sense of honour, and susceptible of the warmest affections of the heart, is driven by the perfidy of a brother, and the suppos'd inhumanity of his father, into a state of confirmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISANTHROPY\">misanthropy</a> and despair.\" He wishes that he \"could blow the trumpet of rebellion through all nature; that he could extinguish with one mortal blow the viperous race of men; and that he could so strike as to destroy the germ of existence.\" In this situation he is hurried on to the perpetration of a series of crimes which find from their very magnitude and atrocity a recommendation to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIS\">dis</a> temper'd mind. Sensible all the while of his own guilt, and suffering for that guilt the severest pangs of remorse, he yet believes himself an instrument of vengeance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Almighty for the punishment of the crimes of others. In thus accomplishing the dreadful destiny, which is prescribed for him, he feels a species of gloomy satisfaction, at the same time that he considers himself as doomed to the performance of that part in life which is to confine his memory to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a> and his soul to perdition. After burning a town, he exclaims, \"O God of vengeance! am I to blame for this? Art thou to blame, O Father of Heaven! when the instruments of thy wrath, the pestilence, flood, and famine overwhelm at once the righteous and the guilty? Who can command the flames to lay their course, to destroy only the noxious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>, and spare the fertile field?\" yet with the same breath he accuses himself of extreme criminality for \"presumptuously wielding the sword of the Most High!\" He frequently laments in the most affecting manner the loss of his innocence, wishes that \"he could return into the womb that bare him, that he hung an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, that he were born a beggar, the meanest hind, a peasant of the field.\" He considers himself as the outcast of Heaven, and finally rejected by the Father of mercy; yet he tells the band of robbers whom he commanded, that the \"Almighty honoured them as agents in his hands to execute his wonderful purposes; employed them as his angels to execute his stern decrees, and pour the vials of his wrath;\" and in a very solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, he supposes that \"the God who ruleth over all had decreed that he should become the chief of these foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>.\"\n\n\"It will be allowed,\" says the translator, \"that the imagination could not have conceived a spectacle more deeply interesting, more powerfully affecting to the mind of man, than that of a human being thus characterized and acting under such impressions. The compassionate interest which the mind feels in the emotions or sufferings of the guilty person, is not diminished by the observation, that he acts under an impression of inevitable destiny; on the contrary, there is something in our nature which leads us the more to compaionate the instrument of those crimes, that we see him consider himself as bound to guilt by fetters, which he has the constant with, but not the strength, to break.\"\n\nThis is indeed true: we sympathise with the hero of the Robbers, not only on account of his exalted sentiments and his inflexible regard to the abstract principles of honour and justice, but much more for that disorder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> which makes him suppose \"his destiny fixed and unalterable,\" at the very time that he is torn with remorse for the perpetration of those crimes by which he believed it to be fulfilling. Destiny, however, is not in this tragedy exhibited as real, but merely as the phantom of a dis temper'd though noble mind. Had the poet represented his hero as in fact decreed by God, or bound by fate, to head a band of foul murderers, and to commit a series of the most atrocious crimes; though our pity for him might not have been lessened, the imprestions of the whole piece on the mind could have been only those of horror and disgust at what would have appeared to us the unequal ways of providence.\n\nThe Tragedy of the Robbers is a striking instance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of Dr Blair's criticism, in opposition to that\nOf Lord Rames. His lordship holds that it is essential to a good tragedy, that its principal facts be borrowed from history; because a mixture of known truth with the fable tends to delude us into a conviction of the reality of the whole. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> considers this as a matter of no great consequence; for \"it is proved by experience, that a fictitious tale, if properly conducted, will melt the heart as much as any real history;\" this observation is verified in the Robbers. It is indeed a very irregular drama, and perhaps could not be acted on a British theatre. But although the whole is known to be a fiction, we believe there are few effusions of human genius which more powerfully excite the emotions of terror and pity. Truth is indeed congenial to the mind; and when a subject proper for tragedy occurs in history or tradition, it is perhaps better to adopt it than to invent one which has no such foundation. But in choosing a subject which makes a figure in history, greater precaution is necessary than where the whole is a fiction. In the latter case, the author is under no restraint other than that the characters and incidents be just copies of nature. But where the story is founded on truth, no circumstances must be added, but such as connect naturally with what are known to be true; history may be supplied, but must not be contradicted. Further, the subject chosen must be distant in time, or at least in place; for the familiarity of recent persons and events ought to be avoided. Familiarity ought more especially to be avoided in an epic poem, the peculiar character of which is dignity and elevation: modern manners make but a poor figure in such a poem. Their familiarity unqualifies them for a lofty subject. The dignity of them will be better understood in future ages, when they are no longer familiar.\n\nAfter Voltaire, no writer, it is probable, will think of rearing an epic poem upon a recent event in the history of his own country. But an event of that kind is perhaps not altogether unqualified for tragedy: it was admitted in Greece; and Shakespeare has employed it successfully in several of his pieces. One advantage it possesses above fiction, that of more readily engaging our belief, which tends above any other particular to raise our sympathy. The scene of comedy is generally laid at home: familiarity is no objection; and we are peculiarly sensible of the ridicule of our own manners.\n\nAfter a proper subject is chosen, the dividing it into parts requires some art. The conclusion of a book in an epic poem, or of an act in a play, cannot be altogether arbitrary; nor be intended for so slight a purpose as to make the parts of equal length. The supposed pause at the end of every book, and the real pause at the end of every act, ought always to coincide with some pause in the action. In this respect, a dramatic or epic poem ought to resemble a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> or period in language, divided into members that are distinguished from each other by proper pauses; or it ought to resemble a piece of music, having a full close at the end, preceded by imperfect closes that contribute to the melody. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of every play into five acts has no other foundation than common practice, and the authority of Horace (D). It is a division purely arbitrary; there is nothing in the nature of the composition which fixes this number rather than any other; and it had been much better if no such number had been ascertained. But, since it is ascertained, every act in a dramatic poem ought to close with some incident that makes a pause in the action; for otherwise there can be no pretext for interrupting the representation. It would be absurd to break off in the very heat of action; against which every one would exclaim: the absurdity still remains where the action relents, if it be not actually suspended for some time. This rule is also applicable to an epic poem: though in it a deviation from the rule is less remarkable; because it is in the reader's power to hide the absurdity, by proceeding instantly to another book. The first book of Paradise Lost ends without any close, perfect or imperfect; it breaks off abruptly, where Satan, seated on his throne, is prepared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a> the convocated host of the fallen angels; and the second book begins with the speech. Milton seems to have copied the \u00c6neid, of which the two first books are divided much in the same manner. Neither is there any proper pause at the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> book of Paradise Lost, nor at the end of the eleventh. In the Iliad little attention is given to this rule.\n\nBesides tragedy, dramatic poetry comprehends comedy and farce. There are sufficiently distinguished from tragedy by their general spirit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a>. \"While pity and terror, and the other strong passions, form the province of the tragic muse, the chief or rather sole instrument of comedy and farce is ridicule.\" These two species of composition are so perpetually running into each other, that we shall not treat of them separately; since what is now known by the name of farce differs in nothing essential from what was called the old comedy among the Greeks. \"Comedy proposes for its object neither the great sufferings nor the great crimes of men; Lectures, but their follies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> vices, those parts of their character which raise in beholders a sense of impropriety, which expose them to be censured and laughed at by others, or which render them troublesome in civil society.\"\n\n\"The subjects of tragedy are not limited to any age or country; but the scene and subject of comedy should always be laid in our own country, and in our own times. The reason is obvious: those decorums of behaviour, those lesser discriminations of character, which afford subject for comedy, change with the differences of countries and times; and can never be so well understood by foreigners as by natives. The comic poet, who aims at correcting improprieties and follies of behaviour, should '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the manners living as they rise.' It is not his business to amuse us with a tale of other times; but to give us pictures taken from among ourselves; to satirize\n\n(d) Novo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a>, neu fit quinto productior actu Fabula.\n\nDe Arte Poetica.\n\nIf you would have your play deserve success,\nGive it five acts complete, nor more nor less. Francis.\nreigning and present vices; to exhibit to the age a faithful copy of itself, with its humours, its follies, and its extravagancies.\n\n\"Comedy may be divided into two kinds: comedy of character, and comedy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a>. The former is the more valuable species; because it is the business of comedy to exhibit the prevailing manners which mark the character of the age in which the scene is laid; yet there should be always as much intrigue as to give us something to wish and something to fear. The incidents should succeed one another, so as to produce striking situations, and to fix our attention; while they afford at the same time a proper field for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of character. The action in comedy, though it demands the poet's care in order to render it animated and natural, is a less significant and important part of the performance than the action in tragedy: as in comedy it is what men say, and how they behave, that draws our attention, rather than what they perform or what they suffer.\n\n\"In the management of characters, one of the most common faults of comic writers is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> of them too far beyond life. Wherever ridicule is concerned, it is indeed extremely difficult to hit the precise point where true wit ends and buffoonery begins. When the miser in Plautus, searching the person whom he suspects of having stolen his casket, after examining first his right hand and then his left, cries out, *offende etiam tertiam\u2014show me your third hand,* there is no one but must be sensible of the extravagance. Certain degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a> are allowed to the comedian, but there are limits set to it by nature and good taste; and supposing the miser to be ever so much engrossed by his jealousy and his suspicions, it is impossible to conceive any man in his wits suspecting another of having more than two hands.\"\n\nIt appears from the plays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOPHANES\">Aristophanes</a> which remain, that the characters in the old comedy of Athens were almost always overcharged. They were likewise direct and avowed satires against particular persons, who were brought upon the stage by name. \"The ridicule employed in them is extravagant, the wit for the most part boisterous and sarcastic, the raillery biting and cruel, and the obscenity that reigns in them is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and intolerable. They seem to have been composed merely for the mob.\" Yet of these abominable dramas, an excellent critic has affirmed, with too much truth, that what is now called *farce* is nothing more than the shadow. The characters in genuine comedy are not those of particular and known persons, but the general characters of the age and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; which it requires no small skill to distinguish clearly and naturally from each other. In attempting this, poets are too apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> characters and introduce them always in pairs; which gives an affected air to the whole piece. The perfection of art is to conceal art. \"A masterly writer will give us his characters distinguished rather by such shades of diversity as are commonly found in society, than marked with such strong oppositions as are rarely brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> contrast in any of the circumstances of real life.\"\n\nThe style of comedy ought to be pure, elegant, and lively, very seldom rising higher than the ordinary tone of polite conversation; and upon no occasion descending into vulgar, mean, and gross expressions; and in one word, action and character being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> parts of every epic and dramatic composition, the sentiments and tone of language ought to be subservient to these, so as to appear natural and proper for the occasion.\n\n\u00a7 2. Respective peculiarities of the Epopee and Drama.\n\nIn a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior beings in a visible shape, no place in machinery can have. There is no place for such objection in an epic poem; a drama, and Boileau, with many other critics, declares strongly for that sort of machinery in an epic poem. But wavering authority, which is apt to impose upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from reason. We may in the first place observe, that this matter is but indistinctly handled by critics: the poetical privilege of animating intangible objects for enlivening a description, is very different from what is termed machinery, where deities, angels, devils, or other supernatural powers, are introduced as real personages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the catastrophe; and yet these two things are confusedly jumbled together in reasoning. The former is founded on a natural principle: but nothing is more unnatural than the latter. Its effects, at the same time, are deplorable. First, it gives an air of fiction to the whole; and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections, and to move our passions; which of itself is sufficient to explain machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination.\n\nAnd next, were it possible, by disguising the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, an imperceptible objection would still remain, which is, that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced; for an evident reason, that virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endowed with passions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions; and as for moral instruction, it is clear, that none can be drawn from beings who act not upon the same principles with us. A fable in Aesop's manner is no objection to this reasoning: his lions, bulls, and goats, are truly men under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>; they act and feel in every respect as human beings; and the moral we draw is founded on that supposition. Homer, it is true, introduces the gods into his fable; but the religion of his country authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs. It must however be observed, that Homer's deities do no honour to his poems: fictions that transgress the bounds of nature, seldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste. They may be of some use to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials, of Nature's production, for elevating his subject, and making it interesting.\n\nOne would be apt to think, that Boileau, declaring for the Heathen deities, intended them only for embellishing the diction: but unluckily he banishes angels and devils, who undoubtedly make a figure in poetic language, equal to the Heathen deities. Boileau, therefore, by pleading for the latter in opposition to the former, certainly meant, if he had any distinct meaning, that the Heathen deities may be introduced as actors. And, in fact, he himself is guilty of that glaring absurdity, where\nwhere it is not so pardonable as in an epic poem: In his ode upon the taking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAMUR\">Namur</a>, he demands with a most serious countenance, whether the walls were built by Apollo or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>; and in relating the passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, anno 1672, he describes the god of that river as fighting with all his might to oppose the French monarch; which is confounding fiction with reality at a strange rate. The French writers in general run into this error: wonderful the effect of custom, entirely to hide from them how ridiculous such fictions are.\n\nThat this is a capital error in Gierufalenme Liberata, Tasso's greatest admirers must acknowledge: a situation can never be intricate, nor the reader even in pain about the catastrophe, to long as there is an angel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGICIAN\">magician</a>, to lend a helping hand. Voltaire, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> upon epic poetry, talking of the Pharsalia, observes judiciously, \"That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and political, joined with the fidelity of Lucan's subject, deprived him of poetical fiction.\" Is it not amazing, that a critic who reasons to justify with respect to others, can be so blind with respect to himself? Voltaire, not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior beings, introduces them into the action: in the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTO\">canto</a> of the Henriade, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> appears in person, and terrifies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>; in the seventh canto, St Louis sends the god of Sleep to Henry; and, in the tenth, the Demons of Discord, Fanaticism, War, &c., afflit Amaule in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> with Furetane, and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God. To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate; and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV. But perfection is not the lot of man.\n\nBut perhaps the most successful weapon that can be employed upon this subject is ridicule. Addison has applied this in an elegant manner: \"Whereas the time of a general peace is, in all appearance, drawing near; being informed that there are several ingenious persons who intend to show their talents to happy an occasion, and being willing, as much as in me lies, to prevent that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of nonsense which we have good cause to apprehend: I do hereby strictly require every person who shall write on this subject, to remember that he is a Christian, and not to sacrifice his catechism to his poetry. In order to it, I do expect of him, in the first place, to make his own poem, without depending upon Phocbus for any part of it, or calling out for aid upon any of the Muses by name. I do likewise positively forbid the sending of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> with any particular message or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a> relating to the peace; and shall by no means suffer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> to take upon her the shape of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENIPOTENTIARY\">plenipotentiary</a> concerned in this great work. I do further declare, that I shall not allow the Delphins to have had a hand in the deaths of the several thousands who have been slain in the late war; being of opinion that all such deaths may be well accounted for by the Christian system of powder and ball. I do therefore strictly forbid the Fates to cut the thread of man's life upon any pretence whatsoever, unless it be for the sake of rhyme. And whereas I have good reason to fear, that Neptune will have a great deal of business on his hands in several poems which we may now suppose are upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANVIL\">anvil</a>, I do also prohibit his appearance, unless it be done in metaphor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a>, or any very short allusion; and that even here he may not be permitted to enter, but with great caution and circumspection. I declare that the same rule may be extended to his whole fraternity of Heathen gods; it being my design to condemn every poem to the flames in which Jupiter thunders, or exercises any other act of authority which does not belong to him. In short, I expect that no pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> shall be introduced, or any fact related which a man cannot give credit to with a good conscience. Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend, or be continued to extend to several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> poets in this nation, who shall still be left in full possession of their gods and goddesses, in the same manner as if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> had never been written.\"\n\nThe marvellous is indeed too much promoted by machinery, that it is not wonderful to find it embraced by the bulk of writers, and perhaps of readers. If indulged at all, it is generally indulged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. Homer introduces his deities with no greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> than his mortals; and Virgil has still less moderation: a pilot spent with watching cannot fall asleep and drop into the sea by natural means: one bed cannot receive the two lovers Aeneas and Dido, without the immediate interposition of superior powers. The ridiculous in such fictions must appear even through the thickest veil of gravity and solemnity.\n\nAngels and devils serve equally with Heathen deities as materials for figurative language; perhaps better among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, because we believe in them, and not in Heathen deities. But every one is sensible, as well as Boileau, that the invisible powers in our creed make a much worse figure as actors in a modern poem than the invisible powers in the Heathen creed did in ancient poems; the cause of which is not far to seek. The Heathen deities, in the opinion of their votaries, were beings elevated one step only above mankind, subject to the same passions, and directed by the same motives; therefore not altogether improper to mix with men in an important action. In our creed, superior beings are placed at such a mighty distance from us, and are of a nature so different, that with no propriety can we appear with them upon the same stage: man, a creature much inferior, loses all dignity in the comparison.\n\nThere can be no doubt that an historical poem admits an historical embellishment of allegory as well as of metaphor, cal poem simile, or other figure. Moral truth, in particular, is admits of allegory, finely illustrated in the allegorical manner; it annuls the fancy to find abstract terms, by a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, metamorphosed into active beings; and it is delightful to fictionists trace a general proposition in a pictured event. But allegorical beings should be confined within their own sphere, and never be admitted to mix in the principal action, nor to co-operate in retarding or advancing the catastrophe; which would have a still worse effect than invisible powers: for the impression of real existence, essential to an epic poem, is inconsistent with that figurative existence which is essential to an allegory; and therefore no method can more effectually prevent the impression of reality than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of allegorical beings co-operating with those whom we conceive to be really existing. The love-episode in the Henriade (canto 9.), insufferable by the discordant mixture of allegory with real life, is copied from that of Rinaldo and Armida in the Gierufalenme Liberata, which hath no merit.\n\nPart II.\n\nmerit to entitle it to be copied. An allegorical object, such as Fame in the Aeneid, and the Temple of Love in the Hymn, may find place in a description; but to introduce Discord as a real personage, imploring the affluence of Love as another real personage, to ennervate the courage of the hero, is making these figurative beings act beyond their sphere, and creating a strange jumble of truth and fiction. The allegory of Sin and Death in the Paradise Lost is possibly not generally relished, though it is not entirely of the same nature with what we have been condemning; in a work comprehending the achievements of superior beings there is more room for fancy than where it is confined to human actions.\n\nWhat is the true notion of an episode? or how is it to be distinguished from the principal action? Every incident that promotes or retards the catastrophe must be part of the principal action. This clears the nature of an episode; which may be defined, \"An incident connected with the principal action, but contributing neither to advance nor retard it.\" The descent of Aeneas into hell does not advance or retard the catastrophe, and therefore is an episode. The story of Nissus and Euryalus, producing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the affairs of the contending parties, is a part of the principal action. The family-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEUD\">feud</a> in the sixth book of the Iliad is of the same nature; for by Hector's retiring from the field of battle to visit his wife, the Grecians had opportunity to breathe, and even to turn upon the Trojans. The unavoidable effect of an episode according to this definition must be, to break the unity of action; and therefore it ought never to be indulged unless to unbend the mind after the fatigue of a long narration. An episode, when such is its purpose, requires the following conditions: it ought to be well connected with the principal action; it ought to be lively and interesting; it ought to be short; and a time ought to be chosen when the principal action relents (x).\n\nIn the following beautiful episode, which closes the second book of Fingal, all these conditions are united.\n\n\"Comal was a son of Albion; the chief of an hundred hills. His deer drunk of a thousand streams; and a thousand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs. His face was the mildness of youth; but his hand the death of heroes. One was his love, and fair was she! the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of mighty Conloch. She appeared like a sun-beam among women, and her hair was like the wing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAVEN\">raven</a>. Her soul was fixed on Comal, and she was his companion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. Often met their eyes of love, and happy were their words in secret. But Gormal loved the maid, the chief of gloomy Ardven. He watched her lone steps on the heath, the foe of unhappy Comal.\n\n\"One day, tired of the chace, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a> had concealed their friends, Comal and the daughter of Conloch met in the cave of Ronan. It was the wonted haunt of Comal. Its sides were hung with his arms; a hundred shields of thongs were there, a hundred helms of sounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>. Rest here, said he, my love Galvina, thou light of the cave of Ronan: a deer appears on the brow of Mora; I go, but soon will return. I hear, said she, dark Gormal my foe: I will rest here; but soon return, my love.\n\n\"He went to the deer of Mora. The daughter of Conloch, to try his love, clothed her white hide with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMOUR\">armour</a>, and frode from the cave of Ronan. Thinking her his foe, his heart beat high, and his colour changed. He drew the bow: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> flew: Galvina fell in blood. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAN\">ran</a> to the cave with halting steps, and called the daughter of Conloch. Where art thou, my love? but no answer. He marked, at length, her heaving heart <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> against the mortal arrow. O Conloch's daughter, is it thou!\u2014he sunk upon her breast.\n\n\"The hunters found the hapless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a>. Many and silent were their steps round the dark dwellings of his love. The fleet of the ocean came: he fought, and the strangers fell: he searched for death over the field; but who could kill the mighty Comal? Throwing away his shield, an arrow found his manly breast. He sleeps with his Galvina: their green tombs are seen by the mariner when he bounds on the waves of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>.\"\n\nNext, upon the peculiarities of a dramatic poem. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> plot the first we shall mention is a double plot: one of which in a drama must resemble an episode in an epic poem; for it would be successful, distract the spectator, instead of entertaining him, if he were forced to attend at the same time to two capital plots equally interesting. And even supposing it an under-plot like an episode, it seldom hath a good effect in tragedy, of which simplicity is a chief property; for an interesting subject that engages our affections, occupies our whole attention, and leaves no room for any separate concern. Variety is more tolerable in comedy; which pretends only to amuse, without totally occupying the mind. But even there, to make a double plot agreeable, is no slight effort of art; the under-plot ought not to vary greatly in its tone from the principal; for discordant emotions are unpleasant when jumbled together; which, by the way, is an infrequent objection to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRAGIC_COMEDY\">tragic-comedy</a>. Upon that account the Provok'd Husband deserves censure; all the scenes that bring the family of the Wrongheads into action, being ludicrous and farcical, are in a very different tone from the principal scenes, displaying severe and bitter expostulations between Lord Townley and his lady. The same objection touches not the double plot of the Careless Husband; the different subjects being sweetly connected, and having only so much variety as to resemble shades of colours harmoniously mixed. But this is not all. The under-plot ought to be connected with that which is principal, so much at least as to employ the same persons: the under-plot ought to occupy the intervals or pauses of the principal action; and both ought to be concluded together. This is the case of the Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nViolent action ought never to be represented on the violent stage. While the dialogue goes on, a thousand particulars representing...\nculars concur to delude us into an impression of reality; genuine sentiments, passionate language, and persuasive gesture: the spectator, once engaged, is willing to be deceived, loses sight of himself, and without scruple enjoys the spectacle as a reality. From this absent state he is roused by violent action; he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAKES\">wakes</a> as from a pleasing dream; and, gathering his senses about him, finds all to be a fiction. Horace delivers the same rule; and founds it upon the same reason:\n\nNe pueros <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORAM\">coram</a> populo Medea trucidet;\nAut humana palam coquet exta nefariori <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATREUS\">Atreus</a>;\nAut in avem Progne veritar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADMUS\">Cadmus</a> in anguem:\nQuodcumque offendis milii lic, incredulus odi.\n\nThe French critics join with Horace in excluding blood from the stage; but overlooking the most substantial objection, they urge only that it is barbarous and shocking to a polite audience. The Greeks had no notion of such delicacy, or rather effeminacy; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> the murder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYTEMNESTRA\">Clytemnestra</a> by her son Orestes, passing behind the scene, as represented by Sophocles: her voice is heard calling out for mercy, bitter expostulations on his part, loud shrieks upon her being stabbed, and then a deep silence. An appeal may be made to every person of feeling, whether this scene be not more horrible than if the deed had been committed in sight of the spectators upon a sudden gust of passion. If Corneille, in representing the affair between Horatius and his sister, upon which the murder ensues behind the scene, had no other view but to remove from the spectators a shocking action, he was guilty of a capital mistake: for murder in cold blood, which in some measure was the case as represented, is more shocking to a polite audience, even where the conclusive stab is not seen, than the same act performed in their presence by violent and unpremeditated passion, as suddenly repeated as committed. Ad-\n\n* Spectator, dillon's observation is just*. That no part of this incident ought to have been represented, but referred for a narrative, with every alleviating circumstance in favour of the hero.\n\nA few words upon the dialogue, which ought to be so conducted as to be a true representation of nature. We talk not here of the sentiments nor of the language (which are treated elsewhere); but of what properly belongs to dialogue-writing; where every single speech, short or long, ought to arise from what is said by the former speaker, and furnish matter for what comes after till the end of the scene. In this view, all the speeches from first to last represent many links of one regular chain. No author, ancient or modern, possesses the art of dialogue equal to Shakespeare. Dryden, in that particular, may justly be placed as his opposite. He frequently introduces three or four persons speaking upon the same subject, each throwing out his own notions separately, without regarding what is said by the rest: take for an example the first scene of Aurenzebe. Sometimes he makes a number club in relating an event, not to a stranger supposed ignorant of it, but to one another, for the sake merely of speaking; of which notable sort of dialogue we have a specimen in the first scene of the first part of the Conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANADA\">Granada</a>. In the second part of the same tragedy, scene second, the King, Abenamar, and Zulema, make their separate observations, like so many colloquies, upon the fluctuating temper of the mob; a dialogue so uncouth puts one in mind of two shepherds in a pastoral excited by a prize to pronounce verses alternately, each in praise of his own mistress.\n\nThis manner of dialogue-writing, besides an unnatural air, has another bad effect; it stays the course of the action, because it is not productive of any consequence. In Congreve's comedies, the action is often suspended to make way for a play of wit.\n\nNo fault is more common among writers than to prolong a speech after the impatience of the person to whom it is addressed ought to prompt him or her to break in. Consider only how the impatient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> is to behave in the mean time. To express his impatience in violent action without interrupting would be unnatural; and yet, to dissemble his impatience, by appearing cool where he ought to be highly inflamed, would be no less so.\n\nRhyme being unnatural and difficult in dialogue, is happily banished from our theatre: the only wonder is that it ever found admittance, especially among a people accustomed to the more manly freedom of Shakespeare's dialogue. By banishing rhyme, we have gained so much as never once to dream that there can be any further improvement. And yet, however suitable blank verse may be to elevated characters and warm passions, it must appear improper and affected in the mouths of the lower sort. Why then should it be a rule, that every scene in tragedy must be in blank verse? Shakespeare, with great judgement, has followed a different rule; which is, to intermix prose with verse, and only to employ the latter where it is required by the importance or dignity of the subject. Familiar thoughts and ordinary facts ought to be expressed in plain language: to hear, for example, a footman deliver a simple message in blank verse must appear ridiculous to every one who is not baffled by custom. In short, that variety of characters and of situations, which is the life of a play, requires not only a suitable variety in the sentiments, but also in the diction.\n\n\u00a7 3. The Three Unities.\n\nWhen we consider the chain of causes and effects in the material world, independent of purpose, design, or thought, we find a number of incidents in succession, without beginning, middle, or end: every thing that happens is both a cause and an effect; being the effect of what goes before, and the cause of what follows: one incident may affect us more, another less; but all of them are links in the universal chain: the mind, in viewing these incidents, cannot rest or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> ultimately upon any one; but is carried along in the train without any close.\n\nBut when the intellectual world is taken under view, in conjunction with the material, the scene is varied, unity of Man acts with deliberation, will, and choice: he aims at some end; glory, for example, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, or conquest; the procuring happiness to individuals, or to his country in general: he proposes means, and lays plans to attain the end proposed. Here are a number of facts or incidents leading to the end in view, the whole composing one chain by the relation of cause and effect. In running over a series of such facts or incidents, we cannot rest upon any one; because they are presented to us as means only, leading to some end; but we rest with satisfaction upon the end or ultimate event; because there the purpose or aim of the chief person or persons is accomplished. This indicates the beginning, the middle, and\nThe Three and the end, of what Aristotle calls an entire action*. Unities.\n\nThe story naturally begins with describing those circumstances which move the person who acts the principal part to form a plan, in order to compass some desired event; the prosecution of that plan, and the obstructions, carry the reader into the heat of action; the middle is properly where the action is the most involved; and the end is where the event is brought about, and the plan accomplished.\n\nWe have given the foregoing example of a plan crowned with success, because it affords the clearest conception of a beginning, a middle, and an end, in which consists unity of action; and indeed stricter unity cannot be imagined than in that case. But an action may have unity, or a beginning, middle, and end, without to intimate a relation of parts; as where the catastrophe is different from what is intended or desired, which frequently happens in our best tragedies. In the \u00c6neid, the hero, after many obstructions, makes his plan effectual. The Iliad is formed upon a different model: it begins with the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon; goes on to describe the several effects produced by that cause; and ends in a reconciliation. Here is unity of action, no doubt, a beginning, a middle, and an end; but inferior to that of the \u00c6neid, which will thus appear. The mind hath a propensity to go forward in the chain of history; it keeps always in view the expected event; and when the incidents or underparts are connected by their relation to the event, the mind runs sweetly and easily along them. This pleasure we have in the \u00c6neid. It is not altogether so pleasant to connect, as in the Iliad, effects by their common cause; for such connection forces the mind to a continual retrospect; looking backward is like walking backward.\n\nIf unity of action be a capital beauty in fable imitative of human affairs, a plurality of unconnected fables must be a capital deformity. For the sake of variety we indulge an under-plot that is connected with the principal; but two unconnected events are extremely unpleasant, even where the same actors are engaged in both. Ariosto is quite licentious in that particular: he carries on at the same time a plurality of unconnected stories. His only excuse is, that his plan is perfectly well adjusted to his subject; for every thing in the Orlando Furioso is wild and extravagant.\n\nThough to state facts in the order of time be natural, yet that order may be varied for the sake of conspicuous beauties. If, for example, a noted story, cold and simple in its first movements, be made the subject of an epic poem, the reader may be hurried into the heat of action; reserving the preliminaries for a conversation piece, if thought necessary; and that method, at the same time, has a peculiar beauty from being dramatic. But a privilege that deviates from nature ought to be sparingly indulged; and yet romance writers make no difficulty of presenting to the reader, without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, unknown persons engaged in some arduous adventure equally unknown. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASSANDRA\">Cassandra</a>, two personages, who afterwards are discovered to be the heroes of the fable, start up completely armed upon the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>, and engage in a single combat.\n\nA play analysed is a chain of connected facts, of which each scene makes a link. Each scene, accordingly, ought to produce some incident relative to the catastrophe or ultimate event, by advancing or retarding it. A scene that produces no incident, and for that reason may be termed barren, ought not to be indulged, because it breaks the unity of action: a barren scene can never be intitled to a place, because the chain is complete without it. In the Old Bachelor, the 3d scene of act 2, and all that follow to the end of that act, are mere conversation-pieces, productive of no consequence. The 10th and 11th scenes, act 3, Double Dealer, and the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th scenes, act 1, Love for Love, are of the same kind. Neither is The Way of World entirely guiltless of such scenes. It will be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> that they help to display characters: it were better, like Dryden in his dramatis personae, to describe characters beforehand, which would not break the chain of action. But a writer of genius has no occasion for such artifice; he can display the characters of his personages much more to the life in sentiment and action. How successfully is this done by Shakespeare! in whose works there is not to be found a single barren scene.\n\nUpon the whole, it appears, that all the facts in an historical fable ought to have a mutual connection, by their common relation to the grand event or catastrophe. And this relation, in which the unity of action consists, is equally essential to epic and dramatic compositions.\n\nHow far the unities of time and of place are essential, is a question of greater intricacy. These unities were strictly observed in the Greek and Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRES\">theatres</a>; and time and place are inculcated by the French and English critics as essential to every dramatic composition. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> these essential unities are also acknowledged by our best poets, though their practice seldom corresponds: they are often forced to take liberties, which they pretend not to justify, against the practice of the Greeks and Romans, and against the solemn decision of their own countrymen. But in the course of this inquiry it will be made evident, that in this article we are under no necessity to copy the ancients; and that our critics are guilty of a mistake, in admitting no greater latitude of place and time than was admitted in Greece and Rome.\n\nIndeed the unities of place and time are not, by the most rigid critics, required in a narrative poem. In such composition, if it pretend to copy nature, these unities would be absurd; because real events are seldom confined within narrow limits either of place or of time: and yet we can follow history, or an historical fable, through all its changes, with the greatest facility; we never once think of measuring the real time by what is taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>; nor of forming any connection between the place of action and that which we occupy.\n\nWe are aware, that the drama differs so far from the epic as to admit different rules. It will be observed, \"That an historical fable, intended for reading solely, is under no limitation of time or of place more than a genuine history; but that a dramatic composition cannot be accurately represented unless it be limited, as its representation is, to one place and to a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; and therefore that no fable can be admitted but what has these properties, because it would be absurd to compose a piece for representation that cannot be justly represented.\" This argument has at least a plausible appearance; and yet one is apt to suspect some fallacy, considering that no critic, however strict, has ventured to confine the unities of place and of time within so narrow bounds.\n\nA view of the Grecian drama, compared with our own, may\nmay perhaps relieve us from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>: if they be differently constructed, as shall be made evident, it is possible that the foregoing reasoning may not be equally applicable to both.\n\nAll authors agree, that tragedy in Greece was derived from the hymns in praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, which were sung in parts by a chorus. Thespis, to relieve the fingers, and for the sake of variety, introduced one actor, whose province it was to explain historically the subject of the song, and who occasionally represented one or other personage. Echylus, introducing a second actor, formed the dialogue; by which the performance became dramatic; and the actors were multiplied when the subject represented made it necessary. But still the chorus, which gave a beginning to tragedy, was considered as an essential part. The first scene, generally, unfolds the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> circumstances that lead to the grand event; and this scene is by Aristotle termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROLOGUE\">prologue</a>. In the second scene, where the action properly begins, the chorus is introduced, which, as originally, continues upon the stage during the whole performance: the chorus frequently makes one in the dialogue; and when the dialogue happens to be suspended, the chorus, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, is employed in singing. Sophocles adheres to this plan religiously. Euripides is not altogether so correct. In some of his pieces it becomes necessary to remove the chorus for a little time; but when that unusual step is risked, matters are so ordered as not to interrupt the representation: the chorus never leave the stage of their own accord, but at the command of some principal personage, who constantly waits their return.\n\nThus the Grecian drama is a continued representation without any interruption; a circumstance that merits attention. A continued representation without a pause affords not opportunity to vary the place of action, nor to prolong the time of the action beyond that of the representation. To a representation so confined in place and time, the foregoing reasoning is strictly applicable: a real or feigned action, that is brought to a conclusion after considerable intervals of time and frequent changes of place, cannot accurately be copied in a representation that admits no latitude in either. Hence it is, that the unities of place and of time, were, or ought to have been, strictly observed in the Greek tragedies; which is made necessary by the very constitution of their drama, for it is absurd to compose a tragedy that cannot be justly represented.\n\nModern critics, who for our drama pretend to establish rules founded on the practice of the Greeks, are guilty of an egregious blunder. The unities of place and of time were in Greece, as we see, a matter of necessity, not of choice; and it is easy to show, that if we submit to such fetters, it must be from choice, not necessity. This will be evident upon taking a view of the constitution of our drama, which differs widely from that of Greece; whether more or less perfect, is a different point, to be handled afterward. By dropping the chorus, opportunity is afforded to divide the representation by intervals of time, during which the stage is evacuated and the spectacle suspended. This qualifies our drama for subjects spread through a wide space both of time and of place: the time supposed to pass during the suspension of the representation is not measured by the time of the suspension; and any place may be supposed, as it is not in sight: by which means, many subjects can be justly represented in our theatres, that were excluded from those of ancient Greece. This doctrine may be illustrated, by comparing a modern play to a set of historical pictures; let us suppose them five in number, and the resemblance will be complete: each of the pictures resembles an act in one of our plays: there must necessarily be the strictest unity of place and of time in each picture; and the same necessity requires these two unities during each act of a play, because during an act there is no interruption in the spectacle. Now, when we view in succession a number of such historical pictures, let it be, for example, the history of Alexander by Le Brun, we have no difficulty to conceive, that months or years have passed between the events exhibited in two different pictures, though the interruption is imperceptible in passing our eye from the one to the other; and we have as little difficulty to conceive a change of place, however great: in which view, there is truly no difference between five acts of a modern play and five such pictures. Where the representation is suspended, we can with the greatest facility suppose any length of time or any change of place: the spectator, it is true, may be conscious, that the real time and place are not the same with what are employed in the representation; but this is a work of reflection; and by the same reflection he may also be conscious, that Garrick is not King Lear, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">playhouse</a> is not Dover cliffs, nor the noise he hears thunder and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. In a word, after an interruption of the representation, it is not more difficult for a spectator to imagine a new place, or a different time, than, at the commencement of the play, to imagine himself at Rome, or in a period of time two thousand years back. And indeed, it is abundantly ridiculous, that a critic, who is willing to hold candlelight for sunshine, and some painted canvasses for a palace or a prison, should affect so much difficulty in imagining a latitude of place or of time in the fable, beyond what is necessary in the representation.\n\nThere are, it must be acknowledged, some effects of great latitude in time, that ought never to be indulged in a composition for the theatre: nothing can be more absurd, than at the close to exhibit a full-grown person to be in who appears a child at the beginning: the mind rejects, dulged, as contrary to all probability, such latitude of time as is requisite for a change so remarkable. The greatest change from place to place hath not altogether the same bad effect: in the bulk of human affairs place is not material; and the mind, when occupied with an interesting event, is little regardless of minute circumstances: these may be varied at will, because they scarcely make any impression.\n\nAt the same time, it is not here meant to justify liberty without any reserve. An unbounded licence with place-relation to place and time, is faulty, for a reason that seems to have been overlooked, which is, that it seldom fails to break the unity of action: in the ordinary course of human affairs, single events, such as are fit to be represented on the stage, are confined to a narrow spot, and generally employ no great extent of time; and accordingly we seldom find strict unity of action in a dramatic composition, where any remarkable latitude is indulged in these particulars. It may even be admitted, that a composition of which employs but one place, and requires not a greater length of time than is necessary for the representation, is chap. 23.\nso much the more perfect; because the confining an event within so narrow bounds, contributes to the unity of action, and also prevents that labour, however slight, which the mind must undergo in imagining frequent changes of place, and many intervals of time. But still we must insist, that such limitation of place and time as was necessary in the Grecian drama, is no rule to us; and therefore, that though such limitation adds one beauty more to the composition, it is at best but a refinement, which may justly give place to a thousand beauties more substantial. And we may add, that it is extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to contract within the Grecian limits any fable so fruitful of incidents in number and variety as to give full scope to the fluctuation of passion.\n\nIt may now appear, that critics who put the unities of place and of time upon the same footing with the unity of action, making them all equally essential, have not attended to the nature and constitution of the modern drama. If they admit an interrupted representation, with which no writer finds fault, it is absurd to reject its greatest advantages, that of representing many interesting subjects excluded from the Grecian stage. If there needs must be a reformation, why not restore the ancient chorus and the ancient continuity of action? There is certainly no medium; for to admit an interruption without relaxing from the strict unities of place and of time, is in effect to load us with all the inconveniences of the ancient drama, and at the same time to withhold from us its advantages.\n\nAnd therefore the only proper question is, Whether our model be or be not a real improvement? This indeed may fairly be called in question; and in order to a comparative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, some particulars must be premised. When a play begins, we have no difficulty to adjust our imagination to the scene of action, however distant it be in time or in place; because we know that the play is a representation only. The case is very different after we are engaged: it is the perfection of representation to hide itself, to impose on the spectator, and to produce in him an impression of reality, as if he were spectator of a real event; but any interruption annihilates that impression, by rousing him out of his waking dream, and unhappily restoring him to his senses. So difficult it is to support the impression of reality, that much lighter interruptions than the interval between two acts are sufficient to dissolve the charm: in the fifth act of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">Mourning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">Bride</a>, the three first scenes are in a room of state, the fourth in a prison; and the change is operated by shifting the scene, which is done in a trice; but however quick the transition may be, it is impracticable to impose upon the spectators so as to make them conceive that they are actually carried from the palace to the prison; they immediately reflect, that the palace and prison are imaginary, and that the whole is a fiction.\n\nFrom these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>, one will naturally be led, at first view, to pronounce the frequent interruptions in the modern drama to be an imperfection. It will occur, \"That every interruption must have the effect to banish the dream of reality, and with it to banish our concern, which cannot subsist while we are conscious that all is a fiction;\" and therefore, that in the modern drama, sufficient time is not afforded for fluctuation and swelling of passion, like what is afforded in that of Greece, where there is no interruption.\" This reasoning, it must be owned, has a specious appearance: but we must not become faint-hearted upon the first repulse; let us rally our troops for a second engagement.\n\nOn the Greek stage, whatever may have been the case on the Roman, the representation was never interrupted, and the division by acts was totally unknown. The word act never once occurs in Aristotle's Poetics, in which he defines exactly every part of the drama, and divides it into the beginning, the middle, and the end. At certain intervals indeed the actors retired; but the stage was not then left empty, nor the curtain let fall; for the chorus continued and sung. Neither do these songs of the chorus divide the Greek tragedies into five portions similar to our acts; though some of the commentators have endeavoured to force them into this office. But it is plain, that the intervals at which the chorus sung are extremely unequal and irregular, suited to the occasion and the subject; and would divide the play sometimes into three, sometimes into seven or eight acts.\n\nAs practice has now established a different plan on the modern stage, has divided every play into five acts, and made a total pause in the representation at the end of each act, the question to be considered is, Whether the plan of the ancient or of the modern drama is best qualified for making a deep impression on the mind? That the preference is due to the plan of the modern drama, will be evident from the following considerations. If it be indeed true, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for the three unities allege, that the audience is deluded into the belief of the reality of a well-acted tragedy, it is certain that this delusion cannot be long supported; for when the spirits are exhausted by close attention, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of passion, an uneasiness ensues, which never fails to banish the waking dream. Now supposing the time that a man can employ with strict attention without wandering to be no greater than is requisite for a single act (a supposition that cannot be far from truth), it follows, that a continued representation of longer endurance than an act, instead of giving scope to fluctuation and swelling of passion, would overstrain the attention, and produce a total absence of mind. In this respect, the four pauses have a fine effect: for by affording to the audience a tolerable respite when the impression of reality is gone, and while nothing material is in agitation, they relieve the mind from its fatigue; and consequently prevent a wandering of thought at the very time possibly of the most interesting scenes.\n\nIn one article, indeed, the Grecian model has greatly the advantage: its chorus, during an interval, not only preserves alive the impressions made upon the audience, but also prepares their hearts finely for new impressions. In our theatres, on the contrary, the audience, at the end of every act, being left to trifle time away, lose every warm impression; and they begin the next act cool and unconcerned, as at the commencement of the representation. This is a great malady in our theatrical representations; but a malady that luckily is not incurable: to revive the Grecian chorus, would be to revive the Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> of place and time; but we can figure a detached chorus coinciding with a pause in the representation, as the ancient chorus did with a pause in the principal action. What objection, for example, can there lie against music between the acts, vocal and instrumental,\nThe three instrumental, adapted to the subject? Such detached chorus, without putting us under any limitation of time or place, would recruit the spirits, and would preserve entire the tone, if not the tide, of passion: the music, after an act, should commence in the tone of the preceding passion, and be gradually varied till it accord with the tone of the passion that is to succeed in the next act. The music and the representation would both of them be gainers by their conjunction; which will thus appear. Music that accords with the present tone of mind, is, on that account, doubly agreeable; and accordingly, though music singly hath not power to raise a passion, it tends greatly to support a passion already raised. Further, music prepares us for the passion that follows, by making cheerful, tender, melancholy, or animated impressions, as the subject requires. Take for an example the first scene of the Mourning Bride, where soft music, in a melancholy strain, prepares us for Almea's deep distress. In this manner, music and representation support each other delightfully: the impression made upon the audience by the representation, is a fine preparation for the music that succeeds; and the impression made by the music is a fine preparation for the representation that succeeds. It appears evident, that by some such contrivance, the modern drama may be improved, so as to enjoy the advantage of the ancient chorus without its slavish limitation of place and time. But to return to the comparison between the ancient and the modern drama.\n\nThe numberless improprieties forced upon the Greek dramatic poets by the constitution of their drama, may be sufficient, one should think, to make us prefer the modern drama, even abstracting from the improvement proposed. To prepare the reader for this article, it must be premised, that in the ancient drama the place of action never varies, a place necessarily must be chosen to which every person may have access without any improbability. This confines the scene to some open place, generally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> before a palace; which excludes from the Grecian theatre transactions within doors, though these commonly are the most important. Such cruel restraint is of itself sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a> the most pregnant invention; and accordingly the Greek writers, in order to preserve unity of place, are reduced to woful improprieties. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIPPOLYTUS\">Hippolytus</a> of Euripides (act i. sc. 6.), Phaedra, distressed in mind and body, is carried without any pretext from her palace to the place of action; there laid upon a couch, unable to support herself upon her limbs; and made to utter many things improper to be heard by a number of women who form the chorus: and what is still more improper, her female attendant uses the strongest entreaties to make her reveal the secret cause of her anguish; which at last Phaedra, contrary to decency and probability, is prevailed upon to do in presence of that very chorus (act ii. sc. 2.). Alcestes, in Euripides, at the point of death, is brought from the palace to the place of action, groaning and lamenting her untimely fate (act ii. sc. 1.). In the Trachiniae of Sophocles (act ii.), a secret is imparted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEJANIRA\">Dejanira</a>, the wife of Hercules, in presence of the chorus. In the tragedy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IPHIGENIA\">Iphigenia</a>, the messenger employed to inform Clytemnestra that Iphigenia was sacrificed, stops short at the place of action, and with a loud voice calls the queen from her palace to hear the news. Again, in the Iphigenia in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAURIS\">Tauris</a> (act iv.), the necessity of the chorus forces Euripides into a gross absurdity, which is to form a secret in their hearing; and, to dignify the absurdity, much care is paid to the chorus, not one woman but a number, to engage them to secrecy. In the Medea of Euripides, that princess makes no difficulty, in presence of the chorus, to plot the death of her husband, of his mistress, and of her father the king of Corinth, all by poison: it was necessary to bring Medea upon the stage; and there is but one place of action, which is always occupied by the chorus. This scene closes the second act; and in the end of the third, the frankly makes the chorus her confidants in plotting the murder of her own children. Terence, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of place, is often forced to make a conversation within doors be heard on the open street: the cries of a woman in labour are there heard distinctly.\n\nThe Greek poets are not less hampered by unity of time than by that of place. In the Hippolytus of Euripides, that prince is banished at the end of the fourth plan act; and in the first scene of the following act, a messenger relates to Theseus the whole particulars of the death of Hippolytus by the sea-monster: that remarkable event must have occupied many hours; and yet in the representation it is confined to the time employed by the chorus upon the stage at the end of the fourth act. The inconsistency is still greater in the Iphigenia in Tauris (act v. sc. 4.): the song could not exhaust half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; and yet the incidents supposed to have happened during that time could not naturally have been transacted in less than half a day.\n\nThe Greek artists are forced, not less frequently, to transgress another rule, derived also from a continued representation. The rule is, that as a vacancy, however momentary, interrupts the representation, it is necessary that the place of action be constantly occupied. Sophocles, with regard to that rule as well as to others, is generally correct: but Euripides cannot bear such restraint; he often evacuates the stage, and leaves it empty for others. Iphigenia in Tauris, after pronouncing a folioquy in the first scene, leaves the place of action, and is succeeded by Orestes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYLADES\">Pylades</a>: they, after some conversation, walk off; and Iphigenia re-enters, accompanied with the chorus. In the Alcestes, which is of the same author, the place of action is void at the end of the third act. It is true, that to cover the irregularity, and to preserve the representation in motion, Euripides is careful to fill the stage without loss of time: but this fill is an interruption, and a link of the chain broken: for during the change of the actors, there must be a space of time, during which the stage is occupied by neither let. It makes indeed a more remarkable interruption, to change the place of action as well as the actors; but that was not practicable upon the Grecian stage.\n\nIt is hard to say upon what model Terence has formed his plays. Having no chorus, there is a pause in the representation at the end of every act: but advantage is not taken of the cessation, even to vary the place of action; for the street is always chosen, where everything passing may be seen by every person; and by that choice, the most striking and interesting parts of the action, which commonly pass within doors, are excluded.\nThe three Unities. He hath submitted to the like slavery with respect to time. In a word, a play with a regular chorus, is not more confined in place and time than his plays are. Thus a zealous sectary follows implicitly ancient forms and ceremonies, without once considering whether their introductory cause be still subsisting. Plautus, of a bolder genius than Terence, makes good use of the liberty afforded by an interrupted representation: he varies the place of action upon all occasions, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> suits his purpose.\n\nThe intelligent reader will by this time understand, that we plead for no change of place in our plays but after an interval, nor for any latitude in point of time but what falls in with an interval. The unities of place and time ought to be strictly observed during each act; for during the representation there is no opportunity for the smallest deviation from either. Hence it is an essential requisite, that during an act the stage be always occupied; for even a momentary vacancy makes an interval or interruption. Another rule is no less essential: it would be a gross <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of the unity of action to exhibit upon the stage two separate actions at the same time; and therefore, to preserve that unity, it is necessary that each personage introduced during an act be linked to those in possession of the stage, so as to join all in one action. These things follow from the very conception of an act, which admits not the slightest interruption: the moment the representation is intermitted, there is an end of that act; and we have no other notion of a new act, but where, after a pause or interval, the representation is again put in motion. French writers, generally speaking, are correct in this particular. The English, on the contrary, are so irregular as scarcely to deserve a criticism; actors not only succeed each other in the same place without connection, but, what is still less excusable, they frequently succeed each other in different places. This change of place in the same act ought never to be indulged; for, beside breaking the unity of the act, it has a disagreeable effect: after an interval, the imagination adapts itself to any place that is necessary, as readily as at the commencement of the play; but during the representation we reject change of place. From the foregoing censure must be excepted the Mourning Bride of Congreve, where regularity concurs with the beauty of sentiment and of language, to make it one of the most complete pieces England has to boast of. It is acknowledged, however, that in point of regularity this elegant performance is not altogether unexceptionable. In the four first acts, the unities of place and time are strictly observed: but in the last act, there is a capital error with respect to unity of place; for in the three first scenes of that act, the place of action is a room of state, which is changed to a prison in the fourth scene: the chain also of the actors is broken; as the persons introduced in the prison are different from those who made their appearance in the room of state. This remarkable interruption of the representation makes in effect two acts instead of one: and therefore, if it be a rule that a play ought not to consist of more acts than five, this performance is far defective in point of regularity. It may be added, that, even admitting six acts, the irregularity would not be altogether removed, without a longer pause in the representation than is allowed in the acting; for more than a momentary interruption is requisite for enabling the imagination readily to fall in with a new place, or with a wide space of time. In The Way of the World, of the same author, unity of place is preserved during every act, and a stricter unity of time during the whole play than is necessary.\n\n\u00a7 4. Of the Opera.\n\nAn opera is a drama represented by music. This entertainment was invented at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>. An exhibition of a drama requires a most brilliant magnificence, and an experienced expense truly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>. The drama must necessarily be by music, composed in verse; for as operas are sung and accompanied with symphonies, they must be in verse to be properly applicable to music. To render this entertainment still more brilliant, it is ornamented with dances and ballets, with superb decorations, and surprising machinery. The dresses of the actors, of those who assist in the chorus, and of the dancers, being all in the most splendid and elegant taste, contribute to render the exhibition highly sumptuous. But notwithstanding this union of arts and pleasures at an immense expense, and notwithstanding a most dazzling pageantry, an opera appears, in the eyes of many people of taste, but as a magnificent absurdity, seeing that nature is never there from the beginning to the end. It is not our business here, however, to determine between the different tastes of mankind.\n\nThe method of expressing our thoughts by singing and music is so little natural, and has something in it forced and affected, that it is not easy to conceive how it could come into the minds of men of genius to represent any human action, and, what is more, a ferocious or tragic action, any otherwise than by speech. We have, it is true, operas in English by Addison, &c., in Italian by Metastasio, in French by M. Quinault, Fontenelle, &c., the subjects of which are so grave and tragic, that one might call them musical tragedies, and real chefs d'oeuvres in their kind. But though we are highly satisfied and greatly affected on reading them, and are much pleased with seeing them represented, yet the spectator is, perhaps, more charmed with the magnificence of the sight and the beauty of the music, than moved with the action and the tragical part of the performance. We are not, however, of that order of critics who strive to prove, that mankind act wrong in finding pleasure in an object with which they are really pleased; who blame a lover for thinking his mistress charming, when her features are by no means regular; Pietfield's and who are perpetually applying the rules of logic to the works of genius: we make these observations merely in order to examine if it be not possible to augment the pleasures of a polite people, by making the opera something more natural, more probable, and more consonant to reason.\n\nWe think, therefore, that the poet should never, or should take at least very rarely, choose a subject from history, but not from fable or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a>, or from the regions of enchantment. Every rational mind is constantly shocked from fable to hear a mutilated hero <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRILL\">trill</a> out, from the slender and enpipe of a chaffinch, To arms! To arms! and in the enchantment, tame tone animate his soldiers, and lead them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAULT\">assault</a>; or harangue an assembly of grave senators, and sometimes a whole body of people. Nothing can be more\nmore burlesque than such exhibitions; and a man must be possessed of a very uncommon sensibility to be affected by them. But as we know not what was the language of the gods, and their manner of expressing themselves, we are at liberty in that case to form what illusions we please, and to suppose that they sung to distinguish themselves from mortals. Besides, all the magic of decorations and machinery become natural, and even necessary, in these kinds of subjects; and therefore readily afford opportunity for all the pomp of these performances. The chorus, the dances, the ballettes, the symphonies and dresses, may likewise be all made to correspond with such subjects, nothing is here affected, absurd, or unnatural. Whoever is possessed of genius, and is well acquainted with mythology, will there find an inexhaustible source of subjects highly diversified, and quite proper for the drama of an opera.\n\nWe shall not speak here of that sort of music which appears to us the most proper for such a drama, and of the several alterations of which we think it susceptible, in order to make it more complete, and to adapt it to a more pathetic, more noble, and more natural expression, as well in the recitatives as in the airs and chorus. (See Music.) We have only here to consider the business of the poet. He should never lose sight of nature, even in the midst of the greatest fiction. A god, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMI\">demi</a>-god, a renowned hero, such as for example as Renaud in Armida, a fairy, a genius, a nymph, or fury, &c. should constantly be represented according to the characters we give them, and never be made to talk the language of a fop or a petite ma\u00eetresse. The recitative, which is the groundwork of the dialogue, requires verses that are free and not regular, such as with a simple cadence approach the nearest to common language. The airs should not be forced into the piece, nor improperly placed for the sake of terminating a scene, or to display the voice of a performer: they should express some sentiment, or some precept, short and striking, or tender and affecting; or some smile lively and natural; and they should arise of themselves from a monologue, or from a scene between two persons; prolixity should here be particularly avoided, especially when such an air makes part of a dialogue; for nothing is more insipid or disagreeable than the countenances of the other actors who appear at the same time, whose silence is quite unmeaning, and who know not what to do, with their hands and feet while the finger is straining his throat. The verse of all the airs should be of the lyric kind, and should contain some poetic image, or paint some noble passion, which may furnish the composer with an opportunity of displaying his talents, and of giving a lively and affecting expression to the music. A phrase that is inanimated can never have a good effect in the performance, but must become insipid and horribly tedious in the air. The trite similes of the Italians, of a stream that flows, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> that flies, &c. are no longer sufferable. The same thing may be said with regard to the chorus, which should be equally natural and well adapted: it is here sometimes a whole people, sometimes the inhabitants of a peculiar country, and sometimes warriors, nymphs, or priests, &c. who raise their voice to demand justice, to implore favour, or render a general homage. The action itself will furnish the poet of genius with ideas, words, and the manner of disposing them.\n\nLastly, the opera being a performance calculated less to satisfy the understanding than to charm the ear and affect the heart, and especially to strike the sight, the poet should have a particular attention to that object, should be skilled in the arts of a theatre, should know how to introduce combats, ballets, feats, games, pompous entries, solemn processions, and such marvellous incidents as occur in the heavens, upon earth, in the sea, and even in the infernal regions: but all these matters demand a strong character, and the utmost precision in the execution: for otherwise, the comic being a near neighbour to the sublime, they will easily become ridiculous. The unity of action must certainly be observed in such a poem, and all the incidental episodes must concur to the principal design; otherwise it would be a necessity of monstrous chaos. It is impossible, however, scrupulously to observe the unity of time and place: though the liberty, which reason allows the poet in this respect, is not without bounds; and the less use he makes of it, the more perfect his poem will be. It is not perhaps impossible so to arrange the objects, that, in changing the decorations, the painter may constantly make appear some part of the principal decoration which characterizes the situation of the scene, as the corner of a palace, at the end of a garden, or some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVENUE\">avenue</a> that leads to it, &c. But all this is liable to difficulties, and even to exceptions; and the art of the painter must concur in such case with that of the poet. For the rest, all the operas of Europe are at least one third too long; especially the Italian. The unity of action requires brevity, and satiety is inseparable from a division that lasts full four hours, and sometimes longer.\n\nThey have indeed endeavoured to obviate this inconvenience by dividing an opera into three, and even into five acts; but experience proves, that this division, though judicious, is still not sufficient to relieve the wearied attention.\n\nSect. II. Of Lyric Poetry.\n\nThe ode is very ancient, and was probably the first species of poetry. It had its source, we may suppose, the odes from the heart, and was employed to express, with becoming fervour and dignity, the grateful sense man entertained of the blessings which daily flowed from God the fountain of all goodness; hence their hallowed hymns, and other devotional compositions of that kind.\n\nBut in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time it was employed, not only to praise the Almighty for bounties received, but to solicit his aid in time of trouble; as is plain from the odes written by King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> and others, and collected by the Jewish Scribes into the book of Psalms, to be sung at their feasts, festivals, and on other solemn occasions. Nor was this practice confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a> only: other nations had their songs of praise and petitions of this sort, which they preferred to their deities in time of public prosperity and public distress, as well as to those heroes who distinguished themselves in arms. Even the American Indians, whose notions of religion are extremely confined, have their war-songs, which they sing to this day.\nIt is reasonable to suppose that the awful purpose to which the ode was applied, gave rise among the ancients to the custom of invoking the muses; and that the poets in order to raise their sentiments and language, so as to be acceptable to their deities, thought it expedient to solicit some divine assistance. Hence poets are said to have been inspired, and hence an unbounded liberty has been given to the ode; for the lyric poet, fired, as it were, with his subject, and borne away on the wings of gratitude, disdains grammatical niceties and common modes of speech, and often soars above rule, though not above reason. This freedom, however, confines chiefly in sudden transitions, bold digressions, and lofty excursions. For the ancient poets, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a>, the most daring and lofty of them all, has in his sublimest flights, and amidst all his rapture, preferred harmony, and often uniformity in his versification; but so great is the variety of his measures, that the traces of immenseness are in a manner lost; and this is one of the excellencies for which that poet is admired, and which, though seemingly devoid of art, requires so much that he has seldom been imitated with success.\n\nThe ancients in their odes indulged such a liberty of fancy, that some of their best poets not only make bold excursions and digressions, but, having in their flights started some new and noble thought, they frequently pursue it, and never more return to their subject. But this loose kind of ode, which seems to reject all method, and in which the poet, having just touched upon his subject, immediately diverts to another, we should think blameable, were it lawful to call in question the authority of those great men who were our preceptors in this art. We may venture to affirm, however, that these compositions stand in no degree of comparison with other odes of theirs, in which, after wandering from the subject in pursuit of new ideas arising from some of its adjuncts, and ranging wantonly, as it were, through a variety of matter, the poet is from some other circumstance led naturally to his subject again; and, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>, having collected the essence of many different flowers, returns home, and unites them all in one uniform pleasing sweet.\n\nThe ode among the ancients signified no more than a song; but with the moderns, the ode and the song are considered as different compositions; the ode being usually employed in grave and lofty subjects, and seldom sung but on solemn occasions.\n\nThe subjects most proper for the ode and song, Horace has pointed out in a few elegant lines.\n\nGods, heroes, conquerors, Olympic crowns,\nLove's pleasing cares, and the free joys of wine,\nAre proper subjects for the lyric song.\n\nTo which we may add, that happiness, the pleasures of a rural life, and such parts of morality as afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> for the promotion of our felicity, and reflections on the conduct of life, are equally suitable to the ode. This both Pindar and Horace were so sensible of, that many of their odes are seasoned with these moral sentences and reflections.\n\nBut who can number ev'ry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> grain\nWash'd by Sicilia's hoarse-refounding main?\n\nOr who can Theron's generous works express,\nAnd tell how many hearts his bounteous virtues blest?\n\nAnd in another Olympic ode, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> by the same poet to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAGORAS\">Diagoras</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a> (and in such esteem, that it was deposited in the temple of Minerva, written in letters of gold), Pindar, after exalting the gods, concludes with this lesson in life:\n\nYet as the gales of fortune various blow,\nTo-day tempestuous, and to-morrow fair,\nDue bounds, ye Rhodians, let your transports know;\nPerhaps to-morrow comes a storm of care.\n\nWolff's PINDAR.\n\nThe man resolv'd and steady to his trust,\nInflexible to ill, and obstinately just,\nMay the rude rabble's insolence despise,\nTheir senseless clamours and tumultuous cries;\nThe tyrant's fierceness he beguiles,\nAnd the stern brow and the harsh voice defies,\nAnd with superior greatness smiles.\n\nNot the rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHIRLWIND\">whirlwind</a>, that deforms\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADRIA\">Adria</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>, and vexes it with storms,\nThe stubborn virtue of his soul can move;\nNor the red arm of angry Jove,\nThat flings the thunder from the sky,\nAnd gives it rage to roar, and strength to fly,\nShould the whole frame of nature round him break,\nIn ruin and confusion hurl'd,\nHe unconcern'd would hear the mighty crack,\nAnd stand secure amidst a falling world.","sp":396,"ep":442},{"h":"STAHL REGARDS THE EXCRETIONS AS THE","t":"l regards the excretions as the means employed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to counteract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tendency of the body towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>.

One of the causes that most favour the tendency of the humours to putrefaction, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLETHORA\">plethora</a>, to which nature opposes, sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the solids that distribute the blood; sometimes the hemorrhagic fluxes which unload the vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>. These latter opinions are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> foundations of what has been called the humoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">pathology</a>, which prevailed so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in most of our medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, and which, with certain modifications is still maintained in many parts of the continent.\n\nThe favourable impulse given to physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, by the philosophical writings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> and Newton, extended itself at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> to physiology; and physiological writers became convinced that it was better to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> and arrange the facts that related to the economy of living beings, than to frame hypothetical systems concerning them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of forming a rational digest of the phenomena of the animal economy was reserved for Haller, who perceived the importance of assembling under one view, the experiments, facts, and observations of preceding writers, and of substituting them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of hypothetical reasonings. He traced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the immense edifice that he designed to construct in his Fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">Lines</a> of Physiology, and executed it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, in his Elements, in which he has brought together into a body of doctrine, as complete as could be expected in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, all the materials of the science. He perceived the inconvenience of a too strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> to the living system. He admitted an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> force, which he considered as peculiar to the animal body, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>, which contains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the experimental cause of muscular motion. He maintained that irritability should never be confounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, and that the irritable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> differs as much from the sensible fibre, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of motion from that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>. Lastly, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, he lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> many new and important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of doctrine respecting the structure of our organs, and the mechanism of our functions; and he relates a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments made on living animals, for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> from nature the secret of those phenomena which she appears most desirous to conceal. We owe to Haller some curious researches respecting the formation of bone, and the production of callus, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as some important elucidations of the manner in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> is developed, and passes through the successive stages of its organization. He has left us many experiments and details respecting the structure of the heart, the circulation of the blood, and the pulsation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>; on the mechanism of the ribs, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERCOSTAL\">intercostal</a> muscles during respiration; on the differences between the sensible and irritable organs; on the action of the brain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, &c.\nThe latter half of the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> is remarkable for many able physiologists, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be admired by posterity, either for the acuteness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, or the important improvements that they have made in the science. We may mention the names of Boreau, La Caze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, Vicq d\u2019Azyr, Bichat, Dumas, and Cuvier in France; of Fontana and Spallanzani in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and of Whytt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, and Darwin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. We cannot pretend to enumerate all the opinions and discoveries of these celebrated men, but must content ourselves with giving a sketch of the three rival systems of Cullen, Brown, and Darwin, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> outline of the opinions of Bichat.\n\nThe physiological system of Cullen was founded chiefly on that of Hoffman. He placed the principle of the whole animal economy in the movement of the vital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, regulated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws of the nervous system. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the vital fluids, according to him, originates in the nerves, and being almost always united in the fenestrum, is easily transmitted from one nervous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> to another, as long as the medullary substance of the nerves continues in its natural state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and continuity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the moving fibres connected with the fenestral organs through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of the brain, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> effect of a movement that commences with those objects. It is on the contractility inherent in the moving fibres, excited by their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, by the application of various stimuli, and often by the immediate influence of the animal or nervous powers, that all the physical actions of a living being depend. He regards this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CONTRACTILE_FORCE\">contractile force</a> as distinct from all those which are possessed by the simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, and the inorganic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> parts of the body.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of Brown, we have given a sufficient detail under his life, and need not repeat it here.\n\nIt is not easy to give a compendious view of the system of Dr Darwin, that shall be intelligible to those who have not examined his celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the Zoonomia; but we shall endeavour to give as brief and perspicuous an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it as possible. It is necessary first to notice the descriptions given of the terms to be employed, which are as follows.\n\nThe immediate organs of fenestrae are, by Dr Darwin, affected to consist, like the muscles, of moving fibres. The contractions of the muscles and of the organs of fenestrae are comprehended under what are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> motions, in contradistinction to the fenestral motions, or the changes which occasionally take place in the fenestrum. By this latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is understood, not only the medulla of the brain and nerves, but also at the same time that living principle or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>, which resides throughout the body, and which we perceive only in its effects. An idea is defined to be a motion of the fibres of some immediate organ of fenestrae; and hence is frequently termed also a fenestral motion. Perception comprehends both the fibrous motion or idea, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to it. When the pain or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> arising from this motion and this attention produces other fibrous motion, it is termed fenestration; thus limiting this term to an active fenestrae. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">Ideas</a>, not immediately excited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects, but which recur without them, are termed either, 1. Ideas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, as when we will to repeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> backwards; or 2. Ideas of suggestion, as when we repeat it forwards, A suggesting B, B suggesting C, &c. from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>.\n\nAfter mentioning a number of experiments to prove the fibrous motions of the organs of fenestrae, Dr Darwin proceeds to lay down the following laws of animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a>.\n\n1. The fibres which constitute the muscles, and organs of fenestrae, possess a power of contraction. The circumstances attending the exertion of this power of contraction constitute the laws of animal motion, as the circumstances attending the exertion of the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> constitute the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\n2. The spirit of animation is the immediate cause of the contraction of animal fibres. It resides in the brain and nerves, and is liable to general or partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a>.\n\n3. The stimulus of bodies external to the moving organ is the remote cause of the original contractions of animal fibres.\n\n4. A certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of stimulus produces irritation, which is an exertion of the spirit of animation exciting the fibres to contraction.\n\n5. A certain quantity of contraction of animal fibres, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be perceived at all, produces pleasure; a greater or less quantity of contraction, if it be perceived at all, produces pain. These constitute sensation.\n\n6. A certain quantity of sensation produces desire or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>. These constitute volition.\n\n7. All animal motions which have occurred at the same time or in immediate succession, become connected, that when one of them is reproduced, others have a tendency to accompany or succeed it. When fibrous contractions succeed or accompany other fibrous contractions, the connection is termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>; when fibrous contractions succeed fenestral motions, the connection is termed causation; when fibrous and fenestral motions reciprocally introduce each other, it is termed catenation of animal motions. All these connections are said to be produced by habit; that is, by frequent repetition. These laws of animal causation are, according to our author, evinced by numerous facts, which occur in our daily exertions, and are employed by him to explain the diseases and decay of the animal system.\n\nThe four fenestral powers, upon which all the actions or motions depend, are thus characterized:\n\nIrritation is an exertion or change of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> part of the fenestrum, residing in the muscles or organs of fenestrae, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the appulses of external bodies.\n\nSensation is an exertion or change of the central parts of the fenestrum, or the whole of it, beginning in some of those extreme parts of it, which reside in the muscles or organs of fenestrae.\n\nVolition is an exertion or change of the central parts of the fenestrum, or of the whole of it, terminating in some of those extreme parts of it which reside in the muscles or organs of fenestrae.\n\nAssociation is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the fenestrum, residing in the muscles or organs of fenestrae, in consequence of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> or attendant fibrous contractions.\n\nTo these four faculties correspond so many classes of fibrous contractions, named irritative, sensitive, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a>, and associative. But all muscular motions, and all ideas, are originally irritative, and become causable by fenestration and volition from habit, i.e. because pleasure or pain, or desire or aversion, have accompanied them;\nthose ideas or muscular motions which have been frequently excited together, ever afterwards have a tendency to accompany each other.\n\nOf these motions the associate seem most to have excited Dr. Darwin's attention. He divides them into three kinds; irritative affections, as when any part of the extracted heart of a frog is irritated by puncture, the whole heart contracts regularly; sensitive affections, or the trains or tribes of motions established by pain or pleasure; and voluntary affections, or those produced by volition.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of this power of volition is supposed to form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and the brute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>; the means of producing pleasure and avoiding pain given to man by this power being denied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>.\n\nCorresponding to these four classes of motions, there are four classes of ideas; irritative, preceded by irritation; sensitive, preceded by the sensation of pleasure or pain; voluntary, preceded by voluntary exertion; and associate, preceded by other ideas or muscular motions.\n\nIt has been observed in Hudibras that\n\n\"A rhetorician's rules\nServe nothing but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> his tools.\"\n\nSo we find that a considerable part of Darwin's work is taken up in establishing the new meaning which he attaches to terms well understood and long adopted.\n\nWe cannot enter more fully at present into the opinions of the Zoonomia, but we shall have occasion to notice some of them in the succeeding part of this article.\n\nBichat's system, which has made so much noise on the continent, is chiefly founded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of life into two kinds, organic and animal; the former of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all organized beings, while the latter, as its name imports, is peculiar to animals. Each of these two kinds of life may be considered as composed of two orders of functions, which succeed each other in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> order. The first of these feries in animal life commences with external objects, and proceeds towards the brain; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> begins in the brain, and is thence propagated to the organs of motion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>. In the first order of functions, the animal is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a>; in the second he is active. External objects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the body through the medium of the first; by the second, the body reacts on external objects.\n\nTwo kinds of motion take place in organic life. In the first the formation of the body is constantly going on; in the second there is a constant decomposition; hence the elements of the body are continually changing, while the organization continues the same. Organic life is accommodated to the continual circulation of matter. The one order of functions assimilates to the nature of the animal, the nutritious particles received into the system; the other rejects what is useless, or is so much altered as to become noxious. The assimilating order of functions consists of digestion, circulation, respiration, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a>; all of which processes the matter received into the body must undergo, before it can become a part of the animal substance. When it has for some time constituted a part of the body, it is taken up by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, conveyed into the circulation, and thrown out thence, by cutaneous or pulmonary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a>, or by some other emanations. Hence, the second order of organic functions, or dissimilating functions, consist of absorption, circulation, exhalation, secretion, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCRETION\">excretion</a>. The brain is the centre of animal life; the heart of organic life.\n\nBichat considers the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of life to be preserved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> which exists between the action of surrounding bodies, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of the system. This reaction is greatest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, hence the principle of life is at that time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. It is least in old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and then the vital principle is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of life is therefore the difference which exists between the efforts of external powers to overturn life, and the internal resistance to support it. The excess of the former shows the weakness of life; that of the latter indicates its strength.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> exhibits Bichat's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the organs, or, as he calls them, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, belonging to animal and organic life, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, which is common to both.\n\nI.

The foetus.\n\nWe have now taken such a view of the progressive state of physiological science, as we deemed consistent with the nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of this article. It has taught us that the prevailing spirit of every age has had a marked influence on the productions both of art and science that have appeared during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; and that physiology has always been impressed with the character of the science that was most prevalent at any particular period. While the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> prevailed in the schools, physiology never extended beyond the bounds that had been set to it by Galen; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> qualities universally prevailed. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for metaphysical speculations began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, this science was given over to the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> futilities and absurd fictions. When Descartes had reformed the principles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the animal economy, like all the other branches of physics, was fettered by the trammels of the Cartesian doctrines. After the genius of philosophers was directed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, physiology also took a chemical turn, which it quitted only to take a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> pointed out to it by the taste for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> and mechanical philosophy, which prevailed among all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century; and now that the study of chemistry is become so general, we see that physiologists are for reducing the functions of the animal economy to the analytical and synthetical operations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>, and converting the living body into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> where a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> is going on while life remains.\n\nWe are now to enter on the phenomena of life, and the functions of organized beings; and here we must premise, that in our illustration of these phenomena and functions we shall occasionally refer to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of living creatures; it being our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> rather to give a comparative view of physiology in general, than to confine our remarks to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> economy in particular. Indeed much of the physiology of man has already been given under Anatomy and Medicine; and of that of the inferior animals, we have treated of the physiology of the order Cete under Cetology; of that of Reptiles under Herpetology; of that of Fishes under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICHTHYOLOGY\">Ichthyology</a>; of that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">Serpents</a> under Ophiology.\n\nChap. I. Of the General Phenomena of Life.\n\nWhen we take a general view of the objects of nature, we see that they differ from each other in many idea of life. important particulars, and we soon find that they may be conveniently divided into two great classes; one capable of growth, nourishment, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>; the other not susceptible of these changes. We perceive that all those substances which are found in the bowels of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and many of those which appear upon its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, continue for an indefinite time in the same circumstances, until they are acted on by each other, when they undergo certain changes which entirely alter their nature and former properties.\n\nSulphur, in its natural state, is a solid substance insoluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and possessing little activity when applied to the human skin; but if it be subjected to the action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, in contact with atmospheric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, it becomes a fluid, very miscible with water, and of a most corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, namely sulphuric acid. The hydrogenous gas found in the upper part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, would remain for ever uncombined with the oxygenous gas which forms part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> in which it floats, were it not subjected to the action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CALORIC\">caloric</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> in a very concentrat-\ned slate; but as soon as either of these agents comes in contact with the mechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of gales, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> takes place, attended with a tremendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, and the hydrogenous gas disappears.\n\nWe find that all the bodies to which we give the name of minerals, possess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> power in themselves which can enable them to resist the operation of external agents; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> of them is composed of a small number of principles, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> appears to be made up of independent particles. Every other body in nature, comprehending the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals, though under certain circumstances subject to the same changes which take place among minerals, have, when these circumstances do not exist, an innate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> by which they are enabled to resist the production of these changes. They do indeed undergo certain alterations, but by these their original habit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> properties are not changed. From the time that a plant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> from the seed, till it ceases to vegetate, it is perpetually receiving an accession of new matter, and giving out a part of its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>: but the new matter is assimilated to it, and becomes a part of the plant; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the plant is preserved, though its component parts are perpetually changing. The same in a still higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> takes place in animals. The individuals of this latter class, comprehending plants and animals, possess peculiar structure, very different from that of the former. Their texture is fibrous, and the fibres arranged and interwoven, so as to form parts called organs, by means of which they carry on certain operations or functions necessary for their preservation, or for the reproduction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Hence these have been called organized bodies, while the others have been denominated brute or inorganic matter. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">NATURAL <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">HISTORY</a>, No. 7.\n\nThe component principles of organized beings are much more numerous in each individual than those of inorganic matter, though their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> number in the former class is smaller than in the latter. In order to present, under a compendious point of view, the distinguishing characteristics of these two classes of beings, we shall give the following table:\n\n| Mobility, | Repose, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGGREGATION\">Aggregation</a>, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">Cohesion</a>, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">Gravitation</a>, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">Condensation</a>, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">Dilatation</a>, | Combination, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">Dissolution</a>. |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n|           |        |             |          |             |              |            |             |             |\n\nRefolvable into\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">Inertia</a>, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">Impulsion</a>, | Attraction, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">Affinity</a>. |\n|----------|------------|-------------|----------|\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">Impression</a>, | Sensation, | Perception, | Affection, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYMPATHY\">Sympathy</a>, | Action, | Locomotion, | Digestion, | Circulation, | Respiration, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">Assimilation</a>, | Accretion, | Reproduction. |\n|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|\n|            |            |             |           |           |         |            |            |               |              |                |           |             |\n\nRefolvable into four general forces\n\n| Sensitive, | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">Motive</a>, | Assimilative, | Vital resistance. |\n|------------|--------|---------------|------------------|\n\nThe differences that are found to prevail between Effects of organized beings and inorganic matter, have always been attributed to something of a superior nature, called vitality or life. This term life forms one of those simple ideas which it is difficult to define, and as all understand the meaning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> is the least necessary; but if it be required, it cannot be expressed more accurately than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Bichat, who calls life the sum of those functions which resist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In short, life is best described by the effects produced on a body while it resides in it, contrasted with the appearances which take place in the same body when life is no longer present.\n\nOne of the most general effects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of life is, as we have said, the resistance which living beings make by it enabled to oppose to the operation of external agents; and this is most remarkably seen with respect to temperature. Every living being possesses, in a greater or lesser degree, the power of preserving nearly a uniform temperature, which is always a few degrees greater than that of the medium in which it lives. In plants, this power seems to exist but in a low degree. Some of the lower animals which inhabit the air, particularly insects, possess it much more completely. The great heat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIVE\">hive</a> of bees is a familiar illustration of this. In birds this property is very remarkable, the heat of their bodies being greater than that of any other species of animals. The heat of fishes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, and of most reptiles, very little exceeds the temperature of the medium in which they reside; but when the water in which fishes live is frozen, they are capable of resisting, for a long time, the consequences of the diminished temperature. The power which many animals possess of resisting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degrees of heat without any considerable increase of their own temperature, seems still more remarkable, and probably led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> of the salamander, which was supposed able to endure the heat of fire, and even extinguish it, when thrown into it for that purpose.\n\nLife seems to pervade almost every part of a living Degrees of being. In animals, every part except the cuticle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, vitality, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, exhibit marks of vitality; but it seems to be distributed...\ndistributed through those parts in a different manner in the various tribes of organized beings. In plants, and in a few of the inferior animals, as the zoophyta, it seems to exist independently in almost every part. A bud, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLIP\">flip</a>, or sucker, torn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> plant, and inserted within the bark of another plant, or placed within the earth, in favourable circumstances, vegetates, increases, and in due time becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> plant, in all respects similar to the parent stock. If a polypus be cut in pieces, each piece lives and grows, till it becomes itself a complete polypus. If a worm be cut in two, so as to leave one part with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and the other with the tail, each part becomes a perfect worm, possessing both head and tail. As we ascend, however, in the scale of beings, we find life less equally and independently diffused. A part cut or torn from the body of most animals quickly loses its vitality; but this is lost sooner in some animals than in others. The head of a turtle or a snake is able to bite many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> or even days, after it is severed from the body; and in the former instance, the animal seems for a long time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> little inconvenience from its loss. The heart of a frog is seen to move many hours after it is cut out.\n\nThe principal effects of the presence of life appear in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of those functions or actions by which living beings preserve their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, or reproduce their like.\n\nOne of the most general properties of organized beings is that susceptibility to motion, which is called irritability, which appears essential to life, and is possessed, in a greater or lesser degree, by every class of organized beings. The motions of plants are sometimes very remarkable, and approach very nearly to those which take place in animals. The stamens of the *cistus helianthemum* are seen to move in various directions when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> shines on them; the leaves of the *mimosa pudica* (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SENSITIVE_PLANT\">sensitive plant</a>), when touched by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, or when irritated by the alighting of an insect on them, immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>; the *dionaea muscipula* (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a>'s fly-trap), when a fly touches its leaves, closes the thorny fringes with which they are beset, on the presumptuous insect, and crushes it to death; but the motions of the *herbarium gyrans* are the most remarkable of all those that take place in plants. The leaves of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> vegetable are seen in constant motion through the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, without the intervention of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> external impulse; and even when a branch is cut off and kept in water, the motion of the leaves continues for many hours together. All the plants which grow above the earth, expose their leaves and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> to the warm sunlight, and when situated in a place which is supplied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> only from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, they gradually direct their branches towards that part by which the light enters. In stormy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> they retract their leaves, and fold up their flowers, and when confined in the dark, their branches retain the position which they had when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> exposed to the light.\n\nThe motions of many of the lower animals, though sufficiently apparent, are more obscure than those of plants. A muscle or an oyster seems to possess little more motion than is necessary to open and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the valves of its shell, and, no more than plants, has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of conveying itself from place to place. This faculty of locomotion, which in all the higher classes of animals is dependent on the will, will be fully considered in the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>.\n\nThe function which appears to be most universally diffused in living beings, is digestion, (including nutrition) or that by which the substances intended for their nourishment are assimilated to the nature of the body which they enter. This function varies considerably in the different classes. Plants merely attract water from the earth in which they grow; by means of the fibrous parts of their roots, whence it is conveyed by innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> vessels throughout the whole plant, in which it appears partly to be decomposed, and partly to remain in the state of water, diluting some of the vegetable principles, and thus forming the juices of the plant. In some of the inferior animals, digestion seems to be almost the only function which they are capable of performing. Thus, many of the zoophytes, as the polypi, appear to be almost entirely composed of a stomach, resembling the finger of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLOVE\">glove</a>, into which the aliment is received, the nutritive part extracted, and the excrementitious part thrown out by the same opening. In most other animals, the alimentary canal has two distinct openings, one for the reception of the food, and the other for the ejection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a>.\n\nBy some animals the food is swallowed entire, and digestion is performed by a simple solution or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRITURATION\">trituration</a> in the stomach; while in others the mouth is furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, or other hard parts, capable of reducing the aliment to a pulpy state, in order to render its further digestion more easy and expeditious. In most animals, the food having undergone some change in the digestive organs, is taken up from them by certain very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> vessels, and carried to every part of the body; but in some it appears rather to exude through pores in the sides of the alimentary canal.\n\nThe function of circulation, by which the fluids are constantly moved through every part of the body, is not so general as either of the former functions. In plants there is no proper circulation; for although there are numerous vessels by which water enters into the substance of the plant, and in which the peculiar juices of the vegetable move, the motions of these fluids are not uniform, and do not tend towards one centre. The same defective circulation appears in many of the inferior animals, as in zoophytes and insects. As we rise, however, to the higher classes, we find a perfect circulation. In these there is always a peculiar organ from which the fluids are conveyed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the body, and to which they again return in a perpetual round. In some animals this central organ is single, while in others it consists of two similar organs joined together, from one of which the whole of the fluids proceed through one particular organ in a lesser circulation, and thence return to the other part, before they are distributed to the general system.\n\nAll organized beings require more or less the presence of atmospheric air for their subsistence, or at least for the due performance of the vital functions. In some, the agency of this fluid is conveyed merely by pores upon the surface; as in plants, in which the leaves absorb the air; and in several of the inferior animals, as insects and worms, over the surface of whose bodies are distributed numerous openings, by which the air enters. In animals of the higher orders there are peculiar organs, called...\ncalled lungs or gills, through which air, or water containing air, enters, and from which its beneficial influence is imparted to the fluids which are circulating through them. In general, these beings exist for a very short time, when deprived of atmospheric air, or when the element in which they live is deprived of oxygen; but in some of the lower classes of animals the absence of oxygen is much less injurious; and there are instances of reptiles in particular having been preserved in a state susceptible of life and motion, while buried for many years in the heart of a tree, or in the middle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. Respiration, then, though in general necessary to the continuance of vitality, may, in many tribes of organized beings, be suspended for a considerable time, without the principle of life being entirely destroyed.\n\nA function equally general, and equally indispensable with that of digestion, and one which forms another characteristic of living beings, is the function of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENERATION\">regeneration</a>, a function more peculiarly necessary, as all organized beings, though capable of resisting for a considerable time the operation of external agents, tend ultimately to corruption and decay; and as they cannot, like inorganic matter, be regenerated by a reunion of their component principles, it was necessary that they should possess the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of producing, while in existence, a creature similar to themselves, to supply their place in the scale of being.\n\nIt has been a very general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> among naturalists, that all living beings, both plants and animals, originate from seeds or eggs produced by the parent. This, although very generally true, is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> fact. Most plants, indeed, with which we are acquainted, appear capable, in their natural state, of producing seeds, which form the embryo of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> plant. But in a great many of them new plants are obtained from buds, slips, or suckers, furnished by the parent. In some animals too, as the polypus, reproduction may be effected by dividing the parent into several pieces; and even the natural generation of these animals is performed by protuberances which grow from the body of the parent, and seem to drop off spontaneously, when capable of an independent existence.\n\nThere are two striking differences in the manner by which living beings are generated. In some, two distinct sets of organs are necessary, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> action of these generation is effected; while in others, as in the instances we have mentioned of the polypus, this act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPULATION\">copulation</a> appears to be unnecessary. Almost all plants possess distinct sexual organs, and in most both male and female organs are situated in the same individual. In these plants the female ovum is impregnated by a very fine powder, which is contained in part of the male organs, and is applied to those of the female. We are fully convinced of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the vegetable copulation, by observing that the females of those plants which have the sexual organs situated in distinct individuals are not capable of producing fruit, or at least do not produce this in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, if they are excluded from the influence of the male; and that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> may be brought about by bringing the male and female organs in contact. Many animals are hermaphrodite; and among these the individuals of some species <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> without the assistance of another individual of the same species. This appears to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with the bivalve shell-fish. Others again, as snails, and most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">mollusca</a>, which crawl upon the earth, copulate reciprocally, or each individual performs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> office of male and female. In most animals, however, the sexes are distinct, and probably a real hermaphrodite in the superior classes never existed. Another striking difference with respect to generation in animals is the more or less perfect state in which they bring forth their young. A large proportion of animals, among which are the insect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, fishes and birds, produce eggs, which are afterwards hatched by the heat of the parent, or by that of the sun. Other classes again, as some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHIBIA\">amphibia</a>, and the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAMMALIA\">mammalia</a>, carry their young for a certain time within an organ destined for that purpose, from which they are excluded in the state of perfect animals.\n\nThe last function which we shall here notice, is senescence. This appears to be less general than any which we have hitherto mentioned. It has indeed been supposed by many philosophers and naturalists, that plants possess a degree of sensibility; and this opinion has been lately avowed and strenuously supported by the elegant, but enthusiastic author of the Botanic Garden, and the Loves of the Plants. That plants possess a susceptibility of receiving impressions, and in consequence of that of being roused into action by external stimuli, we shall readily admit, and shall hereafter assign to this susceptibility its due importance; but as there is no reason to believe that it ever produces senescence, we must not confound it with the sensibility of animals; nor is the difficulty of explaining some of the functions of vegetables, without referring to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of a vegetable nervous system, a sufficient reason for investing them with this faculty. It has even been doubted whether some of the inferior animals, as the zoophytes, possess this function, as nervous fibres have not yet been detected in their organization. It is probable, that there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> gradation in the tribes of organized beings with respect to senescence, as well as the other functions; and though we have not been able to discover all the links of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>, these will probably, as our knowledge of nature increases, come more into view, and we shall then be able to reconcile many circumstances which we cannot at present comprehend.\n\nWith respect to the varieties that take place in the number and degree of the external senses, as possessed by the various classes of animals, we may refer the reader to what has been said on that subject in the first chapter of the comparative part of the article Anatomy.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of life is exceedingly various. We know that there are animals which live but a few hours, as the insects called ephemerae; and that others, as the elephant, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAVEN\">raven</a>, and the pike, may exist for a century. The term of life allotted to plants is also various; some live only for a year, and are hence called annual plants; others exist for two years, and are called biennial plants; while a few surpass in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a> anything with which we are acquainted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> nature. Thus, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a> is said to require 100 years, in order to acquire its full maturity; to retain its perfect vigour for the like term, and to complete at least a third century before it entirely decays. The chestnut is a still more remarkable instance of vegetable longevity. The account of the gigantic chestnut on Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHOS\">Athos</a>, given by\nGeneral by Brydone and other travellers, which has existed for many centuries, must be familiar to most of our readers.\n\nWe have hitherto considered life as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in the exercise of functions; but it may exist independently of this exercise, or it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DORMANT\">dormant</a> for a considerable time, till called into action by particular circumstances.\n\nEvery one knows how long a feed or an egg, when excluded from heat, air, and moisture, will retain the faculty of producing a plant or an animal. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> we have, that this faculty still exists, is that when we place the feed or the egg in circumstances favourable to the development of the embryo which it contains, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of generation goes on, till the plant or the animal is excluded. We know also, that after an organized being has commenced the exercise of its functions, this exercise may cease for a time, or at least become almost imperceptible, while yet the vital power shall remain susceptible of reviving its activity at a future period. We then say that the animal or vegetable is in a torpid state. On this part of the history of life we shall not enter at present, but shall defer the consideration of it till we come to treat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> and death.\n\nThe above is a hasty comparative sketch of the functions exercised by the various tribes of organized beings. It is sufficient to show, that there is in these beings a vital power which completely distinguishes them from brute or inorganic matter.\n\nA question which naturally arises in every thinking mind is, What is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of life, or on what does it depend? Though we profess ourselves unable to answer this question in a satisfactory manner, and believe that all who have hitherto attempted to do so, have failed in their attempts, it may be acceptable to most of our readers to know the opinions of the most respectable writers on this abstruse subject. These, therefore, we shall briefly state.\n\nThese opinions have chiefly rested on the question, whether life be an independent, immaterial principle, or merely a physical or chemical modification of matter. We have already, in the historical view which we have given of the progress of physiology, mentioned some of the more remarkable doctrines respecting the principle of life that have been delivered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the 18th century; we shall here, therefore, only mention those which have been maintained since that time.\n\nMr John Hunter, in his valuable treatise on the blood, supposes the principle of vitality to exist in that fluid, or that the blood has life; and has founded this doctrine chiefly on the following proofs. First, It unites living parts, when it is effused between them. Secondly, It becomes vascular like other living parts; its temperature as it flows from the vessel, is always equal in the most opposite temperature in which the body can bear exposure. Thirdly, It is capable of being acted upon by a stimulus, as is the case when it coagulates. Fourth, Paralytic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, though deprived of motion and sensation, are yet nourished and preserved alive by the blood circulating through them.\n\nMr Hunter's idea of the vitality of the blood is merely the revival of one of the oldest physiological doctrines on record; namely, that delivered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a> by Moses, that in the blood is the life of an animal.\n\nDr Goodwin, in his work on the connection of life with respiration, is of opinion, that the heart is the great seat of the principle of life in all the more perfect animals; and that the contractions of the heart with the ordinary stimulus is the only mark of the presence of this principle; that when the heart contracts under such circumstances, the body is alive; when not, it is dead.\n\nLife he therefore defines to be the faculty of propelling the fluids through the circulatory system. According to him, the external concomitant circumstances which operate upon the body in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> are heat and respiration, which excite the vital principle to action; and whenever the functions of an animal are suddenly suspended, and the body puts on the appearance of death, it is always in our power to determine whether it be really dead, by restoring the temperature, and by inflating the lungs with proper air. He is of opinion, with some others, that there are no means of determining the absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRIVATION\">deprivation</a> of the vital principle but by the presence of putrefaction.\n\nIt has lately become fashionable to consider life as the consequence of certain chemical changes, which are going on in the body; an opinion which is chiefly supported by Hufeland, Girtanner, and Humboldt.\n\nAccording to Hufeland, life is a chemic-animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, Hufeland, to the production of which oxygen is absolutely necessary, and the vital power is the most general and powerful of all the powers of nature. He considers it as the cause of organization, and as possessing the following properties.\n\n1. It has a greater affinity to some organized bodies than to others; thus, the polypus may be cut in pieces without being deprived of it, and a decapitated tortoise or a frog deprived of its heart will live a long time after; whilst to the human body, or a quadruped, it would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> death. According to this physiologist, it is a general rule, that the stronger the affinity between life and an organized being, the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> is the animal; hence the zoophytes, whose whole organization consists in a mouth, a stomach, and a gut, have a life exceedingly tenacious, and difficult to be destroyed.\n\n2. It is in greater quantity in some organized bodies than in others. In general, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>-blooded animals live longer than those with warm blood.\n\n3. It frees bodies from the chemical laws of inanimate matter, and transfers the component parts of a body from the physical or chemical to the organic or living world.\n\n4. It prevents putrefaction, for no organized body can putrefy unless deprived of life.\n\nHumboldt is of opinion, that the degree of vitality Humboldt depends upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> balance of the chemical affinities of all the elementary parts of which the animal body is composed.\n\nSome physiologists of the present day deny the existence of the vital principle altogether. \"The idea of life,\" says Cuvier, \"is one of those general and obscure ideas produced in us by observing a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of phenomena, positing mutual relations, and succeeding each other in a constant order. We know not indeed the nature of the link that unites these phenomena, but we are sensible that a connection must exist; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> is sufficient to induce us to give it a name, which the vulgar are apt to regard as the sign of a particular principle, though in fact that name can only indicate the totality of the phenomena which have occasioned its formation.\"\n\nDr Ferrar, in his observations concerning the vital principle, thinks, that some direct arguments may be brought\nbrought against the general supposition of an independent living principle. These arguments he divides into two kinds, viz. refutations of the general proofs offered in support of the vital principle; and instances of the direct influence of the mind and brain over what is termed the independent living principle. The great proofs for the support of a vital principle are, the contraction of muscles separated from the body on the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIMULANTS\">stimulants</a>; the performance of the vital and involuntary motions without any exertion or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of the mind, and the birth of full-grown fetuses defective of a brain. In all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, something is alleged to operate, independently of the mind, in producing muscular motion.\n\nDr Ferrier, in answer to the first argument drawn from the contraction of separated muscles, affirms, it may be said, viz., That the power of contraction, in a separate muscle, is lost before putrefaction takes place, i.e. before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of its texture; but if its vitality depended on its texture, this ought not to happen. Secondly, The power of contraction, in a separated muscle, is strongest upon its first separation, and becomes weaker by degrees; therefore, the contracting power seems to have been derived from some source from which it is detached by the excision of the part. Thirdly, Irritation of the medulla oblongata, or of the nerves supplying particular muscles, occasions stronger contractions than irritation of the muscles themselves; and Dr Whytt furnishes an experiment on a frog, directly proving, that the action of separated muscles depends upon the nervous energy. Fourthly, Dr Haller himself is obliged to make on this subject a concession sufficient to destroy his favorite hypothesis of the vis insita. Fifthly, When a paralytic limb is convulsed by the electric shock, the motion never takes place without the patient's consciousness. In this case there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> between the vital principle, and that exertion which in voluntary motion is always attributed to the mind. See Chap. iii.\n\nIn answer to the second argument, in favour of a vital principle, drawn from the performances of the vital and other involuntary motions, Dr Ferrier contents himself with only observing, that, allowing the organs of those motions to be supplied with nervous energy, their motions may be very well accounted for by the stimulus of their contained fluids.\n\nThe force of the third argument, drawn from the want of a brain in full-grown fetuses, is taken off by Dr Whytt, who remarks, that as the heart is sometimes wanting in full-grown fetuses, the argument would equally prove, that the heart is not necessary for the continuance of circulation, as that the brain is not necessary to the support of the system. Accordingly, fetuses born without a brain do not, in general, survive birth.\n\nBesides the general supposition of an independent living principle, an inference has been drawn from facts, of a nervous energy independent of the brain. By this term is meant, that condition derived from the brain to different parts of the body, by means of which they become capable of motion. To show, by direct proof, that there is no independent vital principle; Dr Ferrier observes, 1. That it is justly urged by Dr Monro against the doctrine of the vis insita, that there is too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> in the actions of different muscles, affected by different stimuli, to be the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> mechanism. Thus, when the hand or foot is burnt, or otherwise suddenly injured, the muscles on the part immediately stimulated are not thrown into action, nor the muscles on the side irritated, but their antagonists contract immediately, and strongly. Now, if the instantaneous action be in this case chiefly produced by an effort of the mind, the supposition of a distinct vital principle is superfluous; if it be said to be produced by a living power independent of the mind, then there must be a rational power in the body independent of the mind, which is absurd. 2. The state of the vital and involuntary motions is considerably affected by the state of the mind, which equally disproves the existence of a separate vital principle, and proves the dependence of the nervous energy upon the brain. 3. Madness, it is well known, is frequently produced by causes purely mental, and in persons apparently in good health; and, as the patient's sensibility to very powerful stimuli is much diminished in maniacal cases, they afford another proof of the subordination of the nervous energy. 4. It has been observed, that in paralytic cases, motion is frequently destroyed, while sensation remains. As the cause of palsy almost always resides in the brain, this fact appears equally inexplicable on the opinion of a distinct living principle, or of a nervous energy, independent of the brain. 5. When nerves are regenerated, after being cut through, sensation and voluntary motion are not always restored to the parts beneath the division: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> was never made in Dr Monro's experiments. But, on the supposition of a distinct nervous power, the nerve, after its reunion, ought to resume all its offices. 6. Dr Whytt affirms, that when the spinal marrow of a frog is destroyed, after decapitation, no contraction can be excited in the limbs, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> or tearing the muscles. Such are the facts and arguments which Dr Ferrier brings against the opinion of a distinct living principle; and he thinks, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> appears to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us back to the brain as the source of sensibility and irritability.\n\nIn the life of Dr John Brown, we have given an account of the doctrine, of life being a forced state. This doctrine appears to have been first delivered by Dr Cullen, though he afterwards retracted it. Of late Dr Rush of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, in his Lectures on animal life, has advanced many arguments in favour of this doctrine. He includes, in animal life, three properties as applied to the human body, viz. motion, sensation, and thought; and these, when united, compose perfect life. It may exist without thought or sensation; but neither sensation nor thought can exist without motion. He affirms, that the lowest degree of life exists even in the absence of motion. He first considers animal life as it appears in the waking and sleeping state, in a healthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULT\">adult</a>; and afterwards inquires into the modification of its causes in the fetal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>, youthful and middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of life, in certain diseases, in different states of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and in different animals, and lays down the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>:\n\n1. Every part of the human body, the nails and hair excepted, is endowed with sensibility or excitability, or with both.\n\n2. The whole body is so formed and connected, that impressions made in the healthy state upon one part excite\nexcite motion or sensation, or both, in every other part of the body.\n\n3. Life is the effect of certain stimuli acting upon the sensibility and excitability, which are extended in different degrees to every external and internal part of the body; and these stimuli are as necessary to its existence as air is to flame.\n\nHe continues to observe, that the action of the brain, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIASTOLE\">diastole</a> and systole of the heart, the pulsation of the arteries, the contraction of the muscles, the peristaltic motion of the bowels, the absorbing power of the lymphatics, secretion, excretion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>, feeling, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SMELLING\">smelling</a>, taste, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of touch, even thought itself, are all the effects of stimuli acting upon the organs of sense and motion.\n\nThese have been divided into external and internal.\n\n1. The external are light, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, colours, air, heat, exercise, and the pleasures of the senses.\n\n2. The internal stimuli are food, drinks, chyle, blood, tension of the glands which contain secreted liquids, and the exercise of the faculties of the mind.\n\nLife, therefore, (according to the hypothesis of Ruth,) even thought itself, is merely a quality residing in the component parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> system, dependent upon a peculiar organization, by which it is enabled to act, or in some ways to move, on being stimulated or excited.\n\nHence life can never be inherent in a simple uncompounded substance, nor in a particle of animal matter; and if the stimulus be withheld from a living system beyond a given time, all motion, sensation, and thought, must necessarily be extinguished.\n\nInstead of one vital principle, some physiologists have supposed the existence of several in the same body; and from the phenomena that take place in some organized beings, as the reunion of parts that had been separated, the reproduction of others that have been lost, and the separate existence of the divided parts of some worms and zoophytes, it was formerly the opinion of a celebrated lecturer on anatomy, that the vital principle was really divided. From more considerate and extensive inquiry, however, he is now of opinion, that the irritability on which these phenomena depend, is never the direct or immediate operation of the vital principle, but only the consequence of its operation; and in no case exclusively the consequence, but the consequence likewise of other operations proceeding from a number of different causes; and hence it is that a vital principle may often exist where it cannot operate in a sensible manner, from the want of auxiliaries; and hence it is, likewise, that its effects may often be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, at least for a while after its departure.\n\nWith regard to the portions of plants and polypi that continue to live in a separate state, assume the form of their respective species, and propagate their kind, they will be found, on a close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, to have been originally complete systems; many of the plants and many of the polypi that were usually considered as simple individuals, not constituting one animated system, but rather a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of animated systems,\u2014a congeries, too, which after all is nothing more than a species of society, where animated beings are associated together for mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a>; such as we see among men in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; among bees in their cells, which, in point of form, are similar to plants.\n\n\u2020 Barclay on Muscular Motions, p. 265.\n\nAs all living beings are so related to each other, and Neceffity of to the inanimate objects of nature, as to be capable of deriving benefit, or receiving injuries, from the one or to organizing from the other; it seems necessary that they should possess the faculty of perceiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of the beneficial or injurious object, that they may avail themselves of the benefit which it holds out, or avoid the danger which it threatens. Accordingly, we find that all organized beings enjoy in some degree the capacity of receiving impressions, which we think is proved by the motions which take place in them when affected by external agents. When a plant expands its flowers to the sun, or turns as it were, its back to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a>; when it stretches out the fibres of its roots to imbibe the distant moisture, or directs its branches to the only clink by which it can receive the light of day; we think these motions are the consequence of that capacity of receiving impressions, or of being roused to action by stimuli; we think that this may be conceded, without having recourse to the influence of mind, or even the medium of a nervous system; we do not believe that the grass we crush beneath our feet is sensible of pain, nor do we suppose with the poet, that\n\n\"E'en the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEETLE\">beetle</a> that we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> on,\nIn mortal sufferance feels a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\"\n\nbut we are of opinion, that even in the lowest tribes Sensitivity, there is a degree of that faculty, which in the higher orders of animals we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> Sensibility, and which we shall here, after a lecturer on the animal economy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, denominate Sensitivity. This inferior degree of the sensitive faculty we shall suppose to be possessed by plants, zoophytes, and animalcul\u00e6, or those organized beings in which we can perceive no marks of a nervous system; while we shall confine the term Sensibility to all other classes of animals.\n\nThese faculties we consider as qualities of living Bodies, while we regard sensation, like perception, as a quality of mind. We leave it to the metaphysician to mark the line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between sensibility and sensation, and to show how the one arises from the other. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, Part I. chap. 1.\n\nThe organs of sensation consist of the brain properly called, the cerebrum, the medulla oblongata, the system of spinal marrow, the nerves, and ganglia; together forming what is called the nervous system. These parts in the human body have been described under Anatomy. For an account of these organs in the inferior animals, we must refer to the lectures of Cuvier, vol. ii. or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARATIVE_ANATOMY\">Comparative Anatomy</a> of Blumenbach.\n\nIn respect of Sensibility the animal is only passive; but when sensation is produced, he becomes active, in as much as the organs of the external senses are then brought into action. It is by means of these senses, that the animal receives intelligence from without. We shall therefore examine these before we mention the phenomena of sensation in general.\n\n1. Of Feeling.\n\nThe most general of all the senses, and the most wide-Feeling.\nly diffused over the body of an animal is that of touch or feeling. Animals that possess scarcely any other sense seem always to have that of touch. It is doubtedless by this that polyps, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTINIA\">actinia</a>, and other water animals, perceive the approach of their prey, or are warned of impending danger, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the water that is communicated to their bodies. Indeed so general is this sense, that some physiologists think we may reduce all others to it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>; and suppose that smelling, tasting, hearing, and seeing, are only species of feeling. This reference is not uncommon in ordinary speech, as it is not unusual to talk of feeling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>.\n\nBy touch, taken in its ordinary limited sense, we perceive the more striking external qualities of bodies, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, softness, roughness, smoothness, moistness, dryness, heat, cold; of all which, except figure, we could scarcely form any idea by the other senses. There is probably no sense that can so well supply the place of others as that of touch; and it is particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> in those who have lost their sight or hearing. See the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">Blind</a>, especially the Appendix.\n\nThe organs of touch are the skin and its productions, or rather the nervous papillae (see Anatomy, No. 76.) that form so large a part of the true skin. As many animals, however, have the body enveloped in a scaly, flabby, or hairy covering, as to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> contact of the body by external objects, there are other organs that seem destined to fulfil this office. In man, the points of the fingers and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIPS\">lips</a> are the most delicate feeling organs; in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> too, the lips seem to possess an exquisite sensibility, and in some, as the rhinoceros, the upper lip is lengthened out as if to serve the purpose of a hand. The prolonged snouts of the tapir, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAR\">boar</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>, seem to answer the same purpose; and the exquisite sensibility and flexibility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the elephant is well known to fit that organ for almost all the purposes to which the human hand can be applied. The tail, in some species of monkey, opossum and anteater, and in some reptiles, seems to possess a high degree of sensibility. In some animals, as the cat, the whiskers are employed as organs of feeling, as we know that these are erected when the animal is passing through a narrow hole. Several species of fishes have cirri and tentacula, which they seem to use as fingers in ascertaining the approach of their prey; and in insects, the antennae and the palpi are evidently organs of feeling, as are the arms, the tufts, and tentacula of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-stars, sea-urchins, actinia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDUSA\">medusa</a>, and many zoophytes.\n\nMost of the actions of external bodies on the surface of the animal body, are merely mechanical, though the sensations which they communicate may often be the effects of a chemical change in some of the feeling organs, and this change can be produced only in consequence of the power of simple pressure, to form or destroy some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> that take place in the animal system. The sensations which appear most evidently to arise from a chemical change in the organs, are those that give notice of a change of temperature. When a body that has a temperature below that of the animal, comes in contact with the surface of this latter, we know that it abstracts from that surface a part of its caloric, as by the contact it gradually acquires the temperature of the animal; unless, indeed, it be so large and so cold as altogether to destroy life. As, however, the resistance which the animal body gives to a too great change of temperature, generally confines this change to the surface of the body; there must be something more than a mechanical or a chemical action, or the sense of feeling must depend chiefly on the vital principle.\n\nAs the sense of feeling, from its general diffusion, universally may be considered as the most essential of all the senses; its degrees of perfection have considerable influence on the nature of different animals.\n\nOf all vertebral animals, man seems to possess this sense in the most perfect degree; but among the invertebrate animals, the touch seems to improve as the other senses degenerate; and those animals which appear to have no other sense, possess this in so exquisite a degree that they seem to feel even the light.\n\nDr Darwin thinks it probable, that the animal body is furnished with a distinct set of nerves for the sensation of heat and cold. We do not see the necessity of this, as we think that this sensation is very naturally reducible to that of feeling.\n\nTo this head naturally belongs the consideration of what parts of the human body possess sensibility, and of the animals that are insensible. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> is curious, and was some time ago exercised the ingenuity of two very able physiologists, Haller and Whytt; between whom it gave rise to a long and warm dispute. We cannot pretend to enter into the merits of this controversy, for an account of which we refer our readers to Dr Whytt's Physiological Essays, and to the Principes de Physiologie of Dumas, tom. ii. part. iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. i. chap. i.\n\nThe general result seems to be, that many parts will appear sensible or insensible, according to the nature of the stimuli applied to them, and that many of those parts which in their natural and healthy state appear insensible, are when inflamed or otherwise altered by diseases, highly sensible; and that the brain, which is considered as the centre of all sensation, and the puncture or laceration of which is attended with most distressing symptoms in other parts, is to ordinary stimuli as insensible as the cuticle or the nails. See also on this subject, Bichat \"Anatomie Generale,\" tom. i. p. 161.\n\nThe principal morbid affections of this sense, are pain, itching, and want of feeling; for an account of which see Medicine, No. 77. The functions of the skin, independently of its use as an organ of touch, will be considered in two of our succeeding chapters.\n\n2. Of Tasting.\n\nThis sense is the most nearly allied to feeling of any of the other senses, and therefore very properly comes under our consideration after that sense.\n\nThe principal organ of taste is the tongue, especially at its upper surface, point, and edges; but it also extends to the lips, the palate, and the velum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> palati. The tongue is not absolutely necessary to taste, as appears from a case mentioned by Jussieu, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who had only a fleshy tubercle in place of a tongue, and yet possessed the sense sufficiently perfect.\n\nThe several parts of the organs of taste are not equally sensitive to every fluid body; the tongue seems to be more particularly affected by saline and saccharine substances, only affected chiefly, however, at its upper surface; the lips are said to be...\nbe most susceptible of the taste of hellebore, the palate of belladonna, and the gullet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>. The moronidia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELATERIUM\">elaterium</a> is said chiefly to affect the back of the tongue, and colocynth its middle.\n\nThe greater or less perfection of this sense depends much on the softness, flexibility, and moistness of these parts. As man seems to possess these qualifications in a more eminent degree than most other animals, so, in the natural unsophisticated state of the tongue, he probably enjoys the benefit of taste much more highly than they. Such is the case with all young children, and with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, whose simple fare appears to be eaten with a much greater relish than all the delicacies of the voluptuary, who must have recourse to various stimuli to enable him to derive gratification from even the daintiest viands (A).\n\nTaste seems to be more exquisite when the rapid body is strongly pressed between the tongue and the palate. Taste is also rendered more acute when the tongue is stimulated by various condiments, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, mustard, which even, when not taken in such quantity as to be very perceptible themselves, evidently increase the relish of the dishes which they season. Much also depends on the nature and state of the bodies that are applied to the organs of taste. These must, in the first place, be either fluid, or capable of solution in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALIVA\">saliva</a>. They must also possess some saline or acid quality, to render them capable of acting on the nervous papillae. It was formerly supposed, that saline bodies alone possessed the power of affecting the organs of taste; and it was conceived by Bellini, that the different flavours of saline bodies depended on the figure of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> particles. M. Dumas has taken considerable pains, and has advanced several arguments, to show the absurdity of this hypothesis; and we think has treated it with more seriousness than it deserves. That the different sensations which rapid bodies excite in our organs of taste, depend chiefly on a difference in their chemical nature, must, we think, be allowed, and some have gone so far as to suppose, that the sensation depends on some chemical affinity between the rapid body and the nervous fluid.\n\nThe impression which rapid bodies make on the organs of taste is modified by age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, and habit. We know that children are particularly pleased with sweet things, while high seasoned dishes and vinous liquors are more palatable to people of a more advanced age. Women, from various causes, especially during pregnancy, and when labouring under hysterical affections, have often very singular tastes. People of a warm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOBILE\">mobile</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> are often affected by flavours that are almost insensible to others; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> will render palatable many substances, which, when first tasted, are rejected with disgust.\n\nBesides the gratification afforded to animals by the sense of taste, this is supposed to afford one of the principal means of distinguishing between wholesome and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELETERIOUS\">deleterious</a> substances. Indeed, with respect to the inferior animals, this discriminating sense is seldom known to fail, and in this instance, they are superior to man, who is often deceived. There are many poisonous herbs, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> or roots of which have a taste not unpleasant, but which cannot be eaten with impunity.\n\nOn the morbid affections of taste, see Medicine, No. 78.\n\n3. Of Smelling.\n\nThe sense of smelling, like that of taste, is nearly allied to feeling, and is one of those by which we become acquainted with the mechanical and chemical properties of external bodies. It is caused by volatile particles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> off from odorous bodies, and diffused or dissolved in the atmosphere, in union with which they enter the nostrils and affect the nerves of the smelling organs.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain what are the essential organs of smelling. We know that in most animals which breathe through lungs or gills, there is either a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>, or there are certain holes that serve the purpose of nostrils; but in many animals there is nothing similar to these, and yet there is every reason to believe that they possess the sense of smelling in an exquisite degree.\n\nInsects discover their food at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. Butterflies seek their females, even when inclosed in boxes; and as they are liable to be deceived by resemblance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, it is evident that these insects are guided in many circumstances by the sense of smell. Thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-fly (muco vomitoria) lays its eggs on plants that have a fetid smell, imagining that it places them on corrupted flesh, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARVAE\">larvae</a> which are thus produced perish for want of their necessary food.\n\nAs the organ of smell, in all animals which respire air, is situated at the entrance of the organs of respiration, the most probable conjecture that has been proposed respecting its seat in insects, is that of Balthus, since revived by several naturalists, who placed it in the mouths of the tracheae or air tubes. Besides many other reasons that might be stated in support of this opinion, we may observe, that the internal membrane of the tracheae appears very well calculated to perform this office, being soft and moistened, and that the insects in which the tracheae enlarge, and form numerous or considerable vesicles, are those which seem to possess the most perfect sense of smelling. Such are all the scarabaei, the bees, flies, &c.\n\nThe antennae, which other anatomists have supposed to be the seat of smelling in insects, do not appear to Cuvier to possess any of the requisites for that organ.\n\nThe mollusca, which respire air, may also possess this sensation at the entrance of their pulmonary vessels; but it is not necessary to search for a particular organ of this sense in them, as their whole skin appears to resemble a pituitary membrane. It is everywhere soft, fungous, and is always moistened by a great quantity of mucous matter. Finally, it is supplied with numerous nerves, which animate every point of its surface.\n\n(A) It is generally supposed, that the sense of tasting is more acute in some of the inferior animals than in man; an opinion which is founded chiefly on the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and number of the papillae of the tongue in those animals. It is scarcely possible to decide this point; but we should conceive, from the infinite variety of substances that are occasionally subjected to the human palate, and from the extreme delicacy of taste displayed by some individuals, that man has the advantage of his brute neighbours in this sense.\nThe worms and soft zoophytes, and all the polytes, are probably in the same situation. It cannot be doubted but that these animals enjoy the sense of smell. It is chiefly by it that they discover their food, particularly the species that have no eyes. Aristotle remarked, that certain herbs, which have a strong odour, were avoided by cuttle-fishes and the octopus.\n\nOf all the substances which affect our organs of sensation, odours are the least understood, though the impressions which they make on the animal body appear to be most powerful and extensive. Some bodies are always odorous, because the whole or a part of their substance, being volatile, it is constantly lying off; others become odorous, only under certain circumstances; as when a body containing a volatile principle in its composition is decomposed by another that has a less affinity for that principle, e.g., when muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a> is decomposed by quicklime.\n\nOdours seem to be propagated in the air, much in the same manner as one fluid is diffused through another. Their motion is not direct, like that of light, nor is it rapid or susceptible of reflection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a> like light and caloric. The odorous particles of volatile bodies may enter into combination with different substances, by chemical affinity, and thus lose their original properties. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> the effluvia of putrid meat are destroyed by fresh burnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, and the noxious exhalations from pestilential apartments are removed by the vapours of nitric or muriatic acid.\n\nThese circumstances seem to prove that each smell is occasioned by a particular substance floating in the atmosphere. There are others, however, which appear to indicate that odour is not always produced in this manner.\n\nSeveral bodies yield a strong smell for a great length of time, without sustaining any sensible loss of substance; such, for example, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>. Some odours are perceived when no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> can be observed, as the smell which arises from the friction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, that produced by the fusion of a great number of bodies, and even by the melting of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>. In other cases, real evaporations produce no sensible odour; this may be remarked on the disengagement of several gases, and even on the ordinary evaporation of water. Perhaps these phenomena prove only that the force of sensation is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the quantity of the substance by which it is excited, but that it depends on the nature and degree of the affinity of that substance with the nervous fluid.* The action of the greater part of odorous substances on the nervous system, is rendered manifest by a number of other effects besides the sensation of smell; some produce faintings, others giddiness, or even convulsions. Some, on the contrary, serve to remove these disorders: indeed the greater part of medicines act in general rather by their volatile and odorous parts, than by their other principles; and afford new proofs of the influence exercised in the animal economy by the gaseous and impalpable substances, the greater part of which are doubtless still unknown to us.\n\nWe know not whether odours have a peculiar vehicle, besides the matter of heat, which is common to them all in their quality of vapours or elastic fluids. We cannot explain why odours are agreeable or disagreeable to us, nor why those that are disagreeing to us appear pleasing to other animals, and vice versa. Though man and other animals are generally pleased with the odour of those substances which serve them as food; yet when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> is satisfied, this odour often becomes displeasing to them. On the contrary, some animals appear to have a passionate fondness for strong smelling substances which seem altogether useless to them. Thus cats are extremely fond of cat-mint, and the fresh roots of valerian. In general, those odours which are most disagreeable indicate that the substances from which they proceed are injurious. Thus venomous plants, putrid flesh, and poisonous minerals, have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> an unpleasant odour. This rule, however, is not universal; and the sense of smell, like that of taste, is not an unerring guide to man, whatever it may be to other animals.\n\nIt appears that the effluvia of odorous bodies are capable of diffusing themselves through water as well as air; for when these substances are thrown into water as bait for fish, we find that these animals are attracted by the smell from a considerable distance.\n\nThe comparative physiology of this sense is very curious. Comparisons, though we cannot explain the reason of the differences that we find to take place in the various tribes of animals. Man in a state of civilized society, where he may have recourse to a great variety of means by which to distinguish the properties of bodies, has less occasion for acuteness of smell; but we know that savages are in that respect greatly his superiors. Their smell is so acute, that like a blood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HOUND\">hound</a>, they can scent their enemy to a great distance, and pursue his track with almost certain success. Among birds and beasts of prey we also find that acuteness of smell is a very general property. Hyenas, wolves, vultures, and ravens, can distinguish the putrid carcases on which they feed many miles off; and it is asserted by naturalists, that jackalls hunt in packs, and follow their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> like hounds by the scent. There is a curious diversity in this respect among birds, some having this sense very acute, others very blunt. We are told by Gattoni*, that the cock is scarcely affected with the smell of ammonia or hartshorn, while the duck is said to avoid all powerful odours whether agreeable or otherwise. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the nature of the olfactory membrane, nor with that of the nerves distributed to it, to enable us to form an opinion respecting the degree and the kind of sensations they procure to different animals. It may, however, be at first sight presumed, that all things in other respects being equal, the animals in which the olfactory membrane is most extensive, enjoy the sensation of smell most exquisitely; and experience confirms this conjecture. It would be curious to learn why the animals which possess the sense of smell in the highest degree, are precisely those which feed on the most fetid substances, as we observe in dogs which eat carrion.\n\n4. Of Hearing.\n\nThe sense of hearing is more important than any sense which we have yet noticed, but it appears to be less generally diffused.\n\nBy means of it we become acquainted with those properties of bodies which fit them for making sensible impressions on the air, as hardness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, &c.; and these impressions on the air, when communicated to the organs of hearing, convey to our mind the ideas of sound.\nBy this sense we derive two of the highest gratifications that we are capable of enjoying, viz. the pleasures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> and of music; and in this way most animals hold intercourse with each other.\n\nThe organs of hearing differ exceedingly in the various classes of animals. The human ear and its appendages have been described in Anatomy, Part I., chap. vi., sect. 4.; and for an account of these organs in other animals, we must refer to Cuvier's Lectures, vol. ii., or the Comparative Anatomy of Blumenbach, chap. xx. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a>-blooded animals without exception have evident auditory organs; and analogous parts are found in many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>-blooded. In a great number of the inferior classes, however, no such parts have been ascertained, though it is certain that many of them do really hear. In all those in which these organs have been detected, there is always found a gelatinous pulp, covered with a fine, elastic membrane, and in this pulp the ramifications of the auditory nerve are lost. It is therefore highly probable that the seat of hearing resides in the minute nervous fibres that are distributed through the pulp, and that this latter is the medium by which sounds are communicated from the percussed air. We may form a tolerably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> idea of the manner in which this pulpy substance is connected with the external movements that are the cause of sound; for this quivering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JELLY\">jelly</a> will readily receive the concussions of the air or water that are transmitted to it from the vibrations of sonorous bodies, and communicate them to the nervous filaments. Thus far only can we trace the motion of sound; but the steps by which this motion is carried on till the perception of sound is produced in the mind, are equally unknown to the anatomist and the metaphysician.\n\nThe philosophy of sound has already been treated of under Acoustics. It is necessary here to remark only, that the qualities of sound may be distinguished into force, depending on the extent of the vibrations of the body from which the sound proceeds; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a>, depending on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the vibrations; resonance, arising from the intimate composition of the sonorous body; simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODULATION\">modulation</a> of voice, and articulations.\n\nThe human ear can distinguish all these different qualities with relation to one sound; this distinction is made with wonderful accuracy, by persons who frequently exercise that faculty, and particularly by professional musicians. The other mammalia exhibit proofs that they are capable of distinguishing the qualities of sound which relate to speech, that is to say, simple vocal modulations and articulations; for we may observe daily, that they remember the sound and signification of several words. Some are strongly affected by certain sounds. Acute tones produce a painful sensation in dogs, and we also observe that these animals are terrified by violent noises; they therefore distinguish these two properties. Birds have a feeling, no less exquisite, of voice, tone, articulation, and even resonance, since they learn to sing with great correctness; and when their vocal organs permit them, can completely counterfeit the human speech, with all the modifications practised by the individuals they imitate.\n\nAs to cold-blooded animals, it is well known that several of them call each other by certain sounds, and that others, which are incapable of producing sounds, can at least understand them, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">carp</a>, which appear when the noise of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> indicates to them that they are to be fed, &c.; but we know not what qualities of sound they distinguish, and how far, in this respect, the delicacy of their sense of hearing extends.\n\nFor the morbid affections of hearing, see Medicine, No. 82.\n\n5. Of Seeing.\n\nAs we ascend from the simpler to the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> seeing-faculties, we find a greater scope for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; but we also find our physiological difficulties increased. The sense of touch being the most simple of all the senses, requires but a simple organization, and is the most widely diffused; that of vision, on the other hand, is the most complex, and requires for its mechanism, a more elaborate set of organs. There is not, in the whole animal structure, a more curious and admirable organ than the eye, whether we contemplate it in its most perfect state in the human body, or in its most simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a>, as it appears in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> of a snail.\n\nThe anatomy of the human eye has been sufficiently described in the article Anatomy, Part I., chap. vi., sect. 5.; and if our readers desire a fuller account of this organ, we may refer them to the elegant work of Professor Soemmerring. The structure of the eye in the inferior animals is well described in Cuvier's twelfth lecture, and in Blumenbach's Comparative Anatomy, chap. xvi. We shall extract from the former a description of the eyes of insects and crustaceous animals, as being among the most curious and least known subjects of comparative anatomy.\n\n\"The structure of the eye of insects is so very different from that of other animals, even the mollusca, that it would be difficult to believe it an organ of sight, had not experiments, purposely made, demonstrated its use. If we cut out, or cover with opaque matter, the eye of the dragon-fly, it will strike against walls in its flight. If we cover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> eyes of the wasp, it ascends perpendicularly in the air, until it completely disappears; if we cover its simple eyes only, it will not attempt to fly, but will remain perfectly immovable.\n\n\"The surface of a compound eye, when viewed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, exhibits an innumerable multitude of hexagonal facets, slightly convex, and separated from one another by small furrows, which frequently contain fine hairs, more or less long.\n\n\"These facets form altogether a hard and elastic membrane, which, when freed of the substances that adhere to it posteriorly, is very transparent.\n\n\"Each of these small surfaces may be considered either as a cornea, or a crystalline; for it is convex externally, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> internally, but thicker in the middle than at the edges, it is also the only transparent part in this singular eye.\n\n\"Immediately behind this transparent membrane there is an opaque substance, which varies greatly as to colour in different species, and which sometimes forms, even in the same eye, spots or bands of different colours. Its consistence is the same as that of the pigment of the choroides; it entirely covers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> part of the transparent facets, without leaving any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> for the passage of the light.\n\n\"Behind this pigment we find some very short white filaments, in the form of hexagonal prisms, situated close to each other, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of a pavement, and precisely...\nprecisely equal in number to the facets of the cornea; each penetrates into the hollow part of one of these facets, and is separated from it only by the pigment mentioned above. If these filaments are nervous, as in my opinion they appear to be, we may consider each as the retina of the surface behind which it is placed; but it will always remain to be explained, how the light can act on this retina, through a coat of opaque pigment.\n\n\"This multitude of filaments, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the cornea, have behind them a membrane which serves them all as a base, and which is consequently nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the cornea; this membrane is very fine, and of a blackish colour, which is not caused by a pigment, but extends to its most intimate texture; we observe in it very fine whitish lines, which are tracheae, and will produce still finer branches, that penetrate between the hexagonal filaments, as far as the cornea. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we may name this membrane the choroides.\n\n\"A thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the optic nerve is applied to the posterior part of the choroides. This is a real nervous membrane, perfectly similar to the retina of red-blooded animals; it appears that the white filaments, which form the particular retinae of the different ocular surfaces, are productions of this general retina, which perforates the membrane I have named choroides, by a multitude of small and almost imperceptible holes.\n\n\"To obtain a distinct view of all these parts, it is necessary to cut off the head of an insect that has the eyes large, and dissect it posteriorly; each part will then be removed in an order the reverse of that in which I have described them.\n\n\"In the cray fishes, in general, the eye is situated on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> tubercle. The extremity, which is rounded on every side, and sometimes elongated into a cone, when viewed by a glass, presents the same surfaces as the eyes of insects. When we cut this tubercle longitudinally, we observe that the optic nerve passes through it in a cylindrical canal, which occupies the place of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>. Arrived at the centre of the concavity of the eye, it forms a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a>, which detaches very fine filaments in every direction; at a certain distance these filaments meet the choroides, which is nearly concentrical with the cornea, and covers the spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> of the extremity of the nerve, like a hood. All the distance between the choroides and the cornea is occupied, as in insects, by white filaments, closely arranged in a perpendicular direction to each other, and which have the extremity next the cornea also coated with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> pigment.\n\n\"These filaments perforate the choroides, and are continuations of those produced by the button, which terminates the optic nerve.\"\n\nThe immediate seat of vision is still in dispute; but it appears to be the expansion of the optic nerve upon the inner coat of the eye. The other parts of that organ serve to collect, refract, absorb, and sometimes even reflect, the rays of light, according as these operations are required for the distinct vision of any particular animal. Those animals that seek for their prey during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, have a pupil that is very dilatable, and have very little of that dark substance called pigmentum nigrum, that lies between the retina and the choroid coat in diurnal animals. Thus, the former have their eyes better adapted to receive and to retain the feeble rays of light, and thus possess a great advantage over the animals which they pursue, whose eyes are calculated for seeing best in a strong light.\n\nThe subject of vision has been so fully considered under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>, Part I., sect. 5, that it is unnecessary for us to give any detailed account of it here. We shall therefore merely enumerate the principal phenomena.\n\n1. The rays of light proceeding from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> bodies, are collected by the cornea; variously refracted by the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous humours, till they meet in a point (in perfect vision) in the retina, from which the sensation conveyed to the brain, excites there the ideas of light, colour, and other qualities of extreme objects, of which the eye is capable of judging.\n\n2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the object thus pictured on the retina, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, though the mind is habituated to perceive it as if it were erect.\n\n3. There is a certain point within the eye where the retina is deficient, and here the luminous rays make no impression.\n\n4. The eye is calculated to see objects most distinctly at certain distances or foci, though these distances vary considerably in different species, and different individuals. A person of ordinary sight can read a middle-sized print most distinctly at the distance of about eight inches. Those who require less distance are near-sighted, or myopes, and in them the point of divergence of rays is before the retina. Those who require a greater distance are long-sighted, or presbyopes; and in these the point of divergence is behind the retina.\n\n5. In those animals that have two eyes, an image of a luminous object is formed in each, though the mind is accustomed to unite both images into one. In strabismus or squinting, the two eyes not being similarly directed, do not concur in producing a single object.\n\n6. Though the images of many objects are impressed on the retina at the same time, the mind can attend distinctly to only one of them.\n\n7. In perfect vision, the pupil contracts or dilates according to the greater or lesser quantity of light that is present.\n\n8. When the eye has looked steadily for some time on a circumscribed space, of a particular colour, as a piece of red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> placed on a white ground, it perceives a border of a different colour surrounding the original spot. This surrounding colour is called the accidental colour of the former, and differs according to the colour of the original spot. In the present instance it is green, or bluish-green. The other natural colours are attended by the following accidental colours, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, by blue, with nearly an equal proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> by indigo, with a mixture of violet; green by violet, with a mixture of red; blue by red, with a mixture of orange; indigo by yellow, with a considerable mixture of orange; and violet by green, with a considerable mixture of blue (B).\n\n(B) Dr Darwin, in his Zoonomia, vol. i., sect. 2, employs the phenomena of accidental colours to prove that the fibres...\nThe exercise of distinct vision depends chiefly on the following circumstances: 1. The perfect transparency of the cornea, and the several humours of the eye; 2. on the just proportional distance between the cornea and the crystalline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, and on their degree of convexity; 3. on the sensibility of the retina; 4. on the degree of illumination of the visible object; 5. on the colour of the pigmentum between the choroid and the retina; and 6. on the contraction and dilatation of the pupil.\n\nThe action of light on living beings is not confined to its effects in producing vision. It seems to act on the system in general as a moderate but constant stimulus. When the light of day is vivid, as in bright sunshine, the body is more active, and the mind more vigorous, than under a cloudy sky. Those climates which are frequently obscured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> and vapours, are notoriously the birthplaces of seriousness and gloom; and Boeotian dulness and English melancholy have long become proverbial; while on the contrary, the serene brightness of an eastern sky has been considered as peculiarly favourable to the exertions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and the flights of fancy. Mr Stuart, a famous pedellian traveller, told Dr Rush, that during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> which he passed in a high northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, where the sun is visible for several months together, he enjoyed an uncommon share of health and spirits, which he attributed to the long continuance of the light of the sun. In a state of nature most animals retire to rest when the light fails, and few people can sleep soundly, unless light be excluded.\n\nThe stimulating effects of light are peculiarly evident on persons whose nervous system is unusually sensible; they cannot bear strong light, which not only hurts their eyes, but produces considerable agitation on their whole frame. The same effects are produced on those who have been confined in a dark prison. The countenance of these unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and fallow. This latter effect of the absence of light is similar to what takes place in vegetables, as we know that the colour, taste, and smell of plants depend on their being exposed to a due degree of light.\n\nIt has been remarked, that those animals which have been long confined in a dark situation, are universally disposed to grow fat; and this has been found to take place even in condemned criminals, in whom we would least expect it. This obesity has been attributed chiefly to the absence of light. We are disposed to think that the absence of this stimulus can have no immediate effect, but that the disposition to obesity depends rather on the indolence of the confined animals, which is favoured by the absence of light.\n\nFor an account of the principal morbid affections of vision, see Medicine, No 81.\n\n6. Is there in some animals a sixth sense?\n\nFrom the experiments of Jurin and Spallanzani on the flight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">bats</a> that have been deprived of sight, (see Mammalia, No 38.) it has been supposed by some that the accuracy with which these animals in their flight avoided the obstacles that were placed in their way, is owing to some additional senses which they possess. Others have conceived that the sense of hearing which appears to be very acute in the species on which these experiments were made, is sufficient to supply their want of sight. It is scarcely possible to ascertain which of these two opinions is the more probable; but the writer of this article is rather inclined to adopt the latter, from having observed that when he was walking in an unfrequented street, when it was very dark, he was enabled to avoid running against the common flares that projected into the street, from a certain sensation that he perceived, when he approached the wall of the stair, which he cannot better describe than by saying that the air at these points appeared to be unusually still.\n\nWith respect to sensation in general, we may lay down the following laws, which are considered by Dumas as fundamental principles of this function.\n\n1. As activity is an essential character of sensation, this cannot exist without a certain action of the organs, sensation, and must be proportioned to the degree of attention bestowed on the external objects, or ideas by which it is produced.\n\n2. A repetition of the same sensations tends to render the sensibility less acute, and less capable of receiving new impressions. By repose its energy is restored.\n\n3. As sensibility cannot be employed on two impressions at the same time, it must hold a certain balance throughout all the organs, and it cannot be acutely excited in one part, without being proportionably diminished in another.\n\n4. Sensibility is a relative faculty, which is not equally obedient to all kinds of excitations, but only to those which have some relation to it in the different parts of the living body.\n\n5. It is increased and accumulated in the direct proportion to the defect or weakness of stimulus.\n\n6. It is not proportioned to the number, arrangement, or distribution of the nerves, and its changes of increase or diminution are not susceptible of calculation.\n\n7. It is inconstant, variable in its progress, and unconfinable *.\n\nTo these we may add the following facts respecting this function and its organs.\n\n1. The nerves which are principally distributed to the organs of the external senses, arise from that part of the senforium that is within the head.\n\n2. The sensations produced in any part by the contact of external bodies, are more perfect, according as the nerves which terminate in that part arise more immediately from the common senforium.\n\n3. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a> is tightened on a nerve, the parts on which the nerve is distributed are deprived of sensation as far as depends on that nerve.\n\n4.

He finds himself obliged, in describing a piece of marble, for instance, to tell us that it takes a fine polish; that it strikes fire with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>; that it burns to quicklime; that it dissolves in aquafortis, and is precipitated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>; that with vitriolic acid it makes gypsum, &c., &c., &c.; and thus it appears that even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of any thing, with the view of ascertaining its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and with the sole purpose of discrimination, cannot be accomplished without taking notice of its various relations to other things. But what do we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> by the nature of any thing? We are ignorant of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> what makes it that thing and no other thing. We must content ourselves with the discovery of its qualities or properties; and it is the assemblage of these which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> its nature. But this is very inaccurate. These do not constitute its essence, but are the consequences of it. Yet this is all we shall ever know of its nature.\n\nNow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> is nothing but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> expressing some relation which the substance under consideration has to other things. This is true of all such terms. Gravity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, flexibility, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and the like, express nothing but certain matters of fact, which may be observed reflecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of our contemplation in different circumstances of situation with regard to other things. Our distinct notions of individuals, therefore, imply their relations to other things.\n\nThe slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the universe shows an evident connection between all its parts in their various properties. All things <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> are connected with each other by the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and of mind. We are connected with the whole of the solar system by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we extend our observations to the fixed stars, the connection seems to fail; but even here their value may be observed. Their inconceivable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, it is true, renders it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for us to obtain any extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> as to their nature. But these bodies are connected with the solar system by the fames of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> which they emit with that emitted by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> or any shining body. It moves with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, it confits (in most of them at least) of the same colours, and it is reflected, refracted, and inflected, according to the same laws.\n\nIn this unbounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of contemplation, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be directed to the different classes of objects nearly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> we take in them. There is nothing in which we are so much interested as our fellow men; and one of the first steps towards that we make in our knowledge of nature, is an acquaintance with them. We learn their distinctive nature by attending to their characteristic appearances; that is, by observing their actions. We observe them continually producing, like ourselves, certain changes in the situation or condition of surrounding objects; and these changes are evidently directed to certain ends which respect themselves. Observing this subordination of the effects which they produce to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, we consider this adjustment of means to ends as the effect of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">INTENTION</a>, as we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> it to be in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, where we are conscious of this intention, and of these its effects. We therefore interpret those actions of other men, where we observe this Nature of adjustment of means to ends, as marks or signs of intention in them similar to our own. And thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, or power, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, is supposed in them by means of its sign, although the quality itself is not immediately cognizable by our senses. And as this intention in ourselves is accompanied by perception of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects, knowledge of their properties, desire of good, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> from evil, volition, and exertion, without all of which we could not or would not perform the actions which we daily perform, we suppose the same perception, knowledge, desire, aversion, volition, and exertion in them.\n\nThus, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of our mind, we consider the employment of means, by which ends terminating in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> are gained, as the natural signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> or intention. ART, therefore, or the employment of means, is the natural sign of intention; and wherever we observe this adjustment of means to ends, we infer the agency of design.\n\nA small acquaintance with the objects around us, obliges us to extend this inference to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of beings besides our fellow men, namely, to the whole animal\nanimal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>: for in all we observe the same sub-\nserviency to the ends of the agent, in the changes\nwhich we find them continually producing in the ob-\njects around them. These changes are all adjusted to\ntheir own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-being. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, therefore, we\nare forced, by the constitution of our own minds, to infer\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of design or intention in these beings also.\n\nBut in numberless changes produced by external ob-\njects on each other, we observe no such fitness in the\neffects, no such subserviency to the well-being of the\nagent. In such cases, therefore, we make no such in-\nference of thought or design.\n\nThus, then, there is presented to our observation an\nimportant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, by which we arrange all exter-\nnal objects into two classes. The first resembles our-\nselves, in giving external marks of that thought or in-\ntention of which we are conscious; and we suppose in\nthem the other properties which we discover in our-\nselves, but cannot immediately observe in them, viz.\nthought, perception, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, forethought, and all that\ncollection of faculties which we feel in ourselves, and\nwhich constitute the animal. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of objects\nexhibits no such appearances, and we make no such in-\nference. And thus we divide the whole of external nature\ninto the classes of THINKING and UNTHINKING beings.\n\nOur first judgements about these classes will be very\ninaccurate; and we will naturally ascribe the differ-\nences, which we do not very well understand, to the\ndifferences in organic structure, which we clearly ob-\nserve. But when we have knocked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> or perhaps\nsmothered an animal, we find that it no longer gives\nthe former marks of thought and intention, and that it\nnow resembles the class of unthinking beings: And yet\nit still retains all that fitness of organic structure which\nit had before; it seems only to want the intention and\nthe will. This obliges us to conclude that the distinc-\ntion does not arise from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in organic struc-\nture, but from a distinct substance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all think-\ning beings, but separable from their organic frame.\nTo this substance we ascribe thought, intention, contriv-\nance, and all that collection of faculties which we feel\nin ourselves. To this substance in ourselves we refer all\nsensations, pleasures, pains, remembrances, desires, pur-\nposes; and to this aggregate, however imperfectly un-\nderstood, we give the name MIND. Our organic frame,\nwhich seems to be only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of informa-\ntion and operation to the mind, we call our body.\n\nAs the animating principle is not, like our body, the\nimmediate object of the senses, we naturally conceive\nit to be a substance essentially different from those which\nare the objects of our senses. The rudest people have\nshown a disposition to form this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>. Observing\nthat animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was connected with breathing, it was\nnatural to imagine that breathing was living, and that\nbreath was life. It is a remarkable fact, that in most\nlanguages the term for expressing breath is at least one\nof the terms for expressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>; \u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1, \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae,\nin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>, Greek, and Latin, expresses both;\n\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7, or \u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEUTONIC\">Teutonic</a>, comes from g\u0113leifan, to\n\"breathe or sigh;\" duchia or duha, \"the soul,\" in Sla-\nvonic, comes from duchet, \"to breathe;\" fo in the\nGaelic does anal come from annam; and the same rela-\ntion is found between the two words in the Malay and\nother eastern languages. We believe that most persons\ncan recollect some traces of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> in their early\nconceptions of things; and many who do not consider\nthemselves as uncultivated, believe that the soul quits\nthe body along with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> breath. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAR\">Tar</a>-\ntar nations hanging is considered with particular horror,\non <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the ungraceful and filthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> which the\nsoul is obliged to make from the body.\n\nBut the observation of the same appearances of Their opi-\nnion and intention in fishes and other animals, which do not\nbreathe, would soon show that this was unjust, but a rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. Very little refinement indeed\nis necessary to convince us that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> or breath cannot\nbe the substance which thinks, wishes, and designs;\nand that the properties of this substance, whatever it\nis, must be totally different from, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>\nwith, any thing that we know of the immediate objects\nof our senses.\n\nHence we are led to conclude that there are two Of the two\nkinds of substances in nature: One, which is the prin-\ncipal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>; and therefore cannot be the object of\none of our senses, any more than light can be the object of\none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>. This substance alone can feel, think, object of\ndefine, and propose, and is the object of reflection alone. reflection\nThe objects of our senses compose the other clas, and alone, the\ntherefore can have none of the other properties which other of the\nare not cognoscible by the senses. These have all the\nproperties which our senses can discover; and we can\nhave no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of their having any other, nor indeed\nany conception of their having them. This clas is not\nconfined to the unorganized masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; for\nwe see that the bodies of animals lose after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> that\norganic form, and are assimilated to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of\nunthinking beings. It has arisen from such views as\nthis, that while all nations have agreed to call this\nclass of objects by the name BODY, which originally\nexpresses our organic frame, some nations, farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a>-\nvanced in cultivation or refinement, have contrived an\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> term to express this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> substance of which\nall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> beings are composed. Such a term we\nhave in the words materies, idem.\n\nMatter, then, is that substance which is immediate-The distinc-\ntion is not thus immediately cognoscible by our senses between ma-\nterial and called immaterial: hence it is that mind is said to be substances\nimmaterial. It is of importance to keep in mind this very im-\nportance, merely grammatical. Little more is ne-\ncessary for detecting the sophisms of Helvetius, Mira-\nbeau, and other sages of the Gallic school, who have\nbeen anxious to remove the ties of moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> our conceptions of our intel-\nlectual nature. It will also serve to show how hastily\nthey have formed their opinions who have ascribed to\nthe immediate agency of mind all those relations which\nare observed in the actions of bodies on each other at\na distance. The connecting principles of such rela-\ntions \u00e9 distante (if there be any such), are not the im-\nmediate objects of our senses: they are therefore im-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a>. But it does not follow that they are minds.\nThere may be many immaterial substances which are\nnot minds. We know nothing of any object what-\never but by the observation of certain appearances,\nwhich suggest to our minds the existence and agency\nof its qualities or powers. Such phenomena are the\nnatural signs of these qualities, and it is to these signs\nthat we must always have recourse when we wish to\nconceive without ambiguity concerning them. What is the characteristic phenomenon of mind, or what is the distinguishing quality which brings it into view? It is intention: and it may be asserted with the utmost confidence, that we have no other mark by which mind is immediately suggested to us, or that would ever have made us suppose that there existed another mind besides our own. The phenomenon by which this quality is suggested to us is art, or the employment of means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> ends; and the mark of art is the supposed conduciveness of these ends to the well-being of the agent. Where this train is not observed, design or intention is never thought of; and therefore where intention is not perceived in any immaterial substance, if any such has ever been observed, it is an abuse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> to call it mind. We do not think that even perception and intelligence entitle us to give the name mind to the substance in which they are inherent, because it is from marks of intention alone that we infer the existence of mind; and although these must be accompanied with perception and intelligence, it does not follow that the substance which can perceive and understand must also desire and propose. However difficult we may find it to separate them, they are evidently separable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. And let not this assertion be too hastily objected to; for the separation has been made by persons most eminent for their knowledge and discernment. When Leibnitz ascribed to his monads, or what we call the ultimate atoms of matter, a perception of their situation in the universe, and a motion precisely suited to this perception, he was the fartherest in the world from supposing them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> or endowed with minds. It is true indeed, that others, who think and call themselves philosophers, are much more liberal in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this term. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> author of great metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> says, \"I call that mind which moves, and that body which is moved.\" This class of philosophers assert that no motion whatever is begun except by the agency of an animating principle, which (after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>) they call Nature, and which has in these days been exalted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a god. All this jargon (for it is nothing else) has arisen from the puzzle in which naturalists think themselves involved in attempting to explain the production of motion in a body at a distance from that body which is conceived as the cause of this motion. After having been reluctantly obliged, by the reasonings of Newton, to abandon their methods of explaining such phenomena by the impulse of an intervening fluid, nothing seemed left but the assertion that these motions were produced by minds, as in the case of our own exertions. These explanations (if they deserve the name) cannot be objected to in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> than as an abuse of language, and as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of an unmeaning jargon. We have, and can have, no notion of mind different from those of our own minds; and we discover the existence of other minds as we discover the existence of bodies, by means of phenomena which are characteristic of minds, that is, which resemble those phenomena that follow the exertion of our own mental faculties, that is, by the employment of means to attain selfish ends; and where such appearances are not observed, no existence of a mind is inferred. When we see a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the top of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and dash out his brains on the pavement, we never ascribe this motion to his mind. Although the fitness of many of the celestial motions for most important purposes makes us suppose design and contrivance somewhere, and therefore a Supreme Mind, we no more think of inferring a mind in the earth from the fitness of its motions for purposes most beneficial to its inhabitants, than of inferring a mind in a bit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> from its fitness for nourishing our bodies. It is not from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> motions of animals that their minds are inferred, but from the conduciveness of these motions to the well-being of the animal.\n\nThe mind therefore, in the ordinary language of all men, is applied to what desires and wills at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that it perceives and understands. If we desire to call that mind which produces motion, we must derive it from our notions of its qualities or attributes from observing that which their effects. We must therefore discover the general laws by which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, that is, the general laws observed in those motions which we consider as their effects. Now these are the general laws of motion; and in none of these can we find the least coincidence with what we are accustomed to call the laws of mind. Nay, it has been the total want of similarity which has given rise to the distinction which all men, in all ages and countries, have made between mind and matter. This distinction is found in all languages; and it is an unpardonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> which men take with language when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> a term of distinction, a specific term, to express things of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. What these authors have been pleased to call mind, the whole world besides have called by another name, force; which, though borrowed from our own exertions, is yet sufficiently distinctive, and never leads us to confound things that are different, except in the language of some modern philosophers, who apply it to the laws of the agency of mind; and, when speaking of the force of motives, &c., commit the same mistakes which the followers of Aristotle commit in the use of the term mind. Force, in the language of these philosophers, means what connects the operations of mind; as mind, in the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Monboddo, is that which connects the operations of body.\n\nThose are not less to blame who consider this Nature, the principle of Aristotle, this principle of motion, as an existence of or substance different both from matter and from the distinct minds of intelligent creatures. Aristotle calls it in form from matter places \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2. He might with equal propriety, and mind, \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f22 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. Besides, we have no evidence for the separability of this \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 from body as we have for the separability of such minds as our own, the genuine \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2. Nay, his whole doctrines, when maturely considered, assume their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> inseparability.\n\nThis doctrine of elemental minds, therefore, as the immediate causes of the phenomena of the material world, is an abuse of language. It is a jargon; and it language, is a frivolous abuse, for it offers no explanation whatever. The phenomena are totally unlike the phenomena of ordinary minds, and therefore receive no explanation from them; and since our knowledge of these quasi-minds must be derived entirely from the phenomena, it will be precisely the same, although we express it in common language. We shall not indeed raise the wonder of our hearers, as those do who fill the world with minds which they never suspected to exist; but we shall\nnot bewilder their imaginations, confound their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, and mislead their judgements.\n\nWe flatter ourselves that our readers will not think these observations unseasonable or misplaced. Of all mistakes that the naturalist can fall into, there is none more fatal to his progress in knowledge than the confounding things which are essentially different; and of all the distinctions which can be made among the objects of our contemplation, there is none of equal philosophical importance with this between mind and matter: And when we consider the consequences which naturally follow from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of ideas, and particularly those which follow from linking the mental faculties of man to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, consequences which the experience of the present eventful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> shows to be destructive of all that is noble or desirable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature, and of all that is comfortable in this life, and which blasts every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> excellence\u2014we cannot be too anxious to have this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> distinction put in the plainest point of view, and expressed in the most familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, \"so that he who runneth may read.\" When we see the frenzy which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of man has raised in our neighbourhood, and hear the dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> incessantly appealed to in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of whatever our hearts shudder at as shocking and abominable; and when we see a man (A), of great reputation as a naturalist, and of professed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> moderation, congratulating his countrymen on the rapid improvement and almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of philosophy; and after giving a short sketch of the constitution of the visible universe, summing up all with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a> attractions, and that particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a> which constitutes God (horrefac referens!);\u2014is it not full time for us to stop short, and to ask our own hearts \"whither are you wandering?\"\u2014But found philosophy, reasoning from effects to their causes, will here listen to the words of our sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a>: \"By their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> ye shall know them.

The useless absurd and the shocking consequences of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> philosophy now in vogue should give us the same abhorrence; and should make us abandon its blood-stained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and return to the delightful paths of nature, to survey the works of God, and feast our eyes with the displays of mind, which offer themselves on every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in designs of the most extensive influence and the most beautiful contrivance.

Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> is almost unbounded, reaching from an atom to God himself. It is absolutely necessary for the successful cultivation of this immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of knowledge, that it be committed to the care of different cultivators, and that its various portions be treated in different ways: and, accordingly, the various talts of men have given this curiosity different directions; and the study, like all other tasks, has been promoted by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of labour.\n\nSome philosophers have attended only to the appearances of fitness which are exhibited in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the universe; and by arranging these into different classes, and interpreting them as indications of thought and intention, have acquired the knowledge of many classes of sentient and intelligent beings, actuated by propensities, and directed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>.","sp":23,"ep":26},{"h":"THIS COMBINATION OF AIR WITH WATER IS VERY DISTINCTLY SEEN BY","t":"s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is very distinctly seen by means of the air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a small glass containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water, fresh drawn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, be exposed, as in fig. 60, under the receiver, and the air rarefied, small bubbles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be observed to form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the inner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the glass, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> on the surface of any body immersed in it, which will increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, and then detach themselves from the glass and reach the top; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> advances, the whole water begins to show very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> air-bubbles rising to the top; and this appearance will continue for a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, till it be completely disengaged. Warming the water will occasion a still farther separation of air, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> will separate all that can be disengaged. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> assigned for these air-bubbles first appearing on the surface of the glass, &c., is, that air is attracted by bodies, and adheres to their surface. This may be so. But it is more probably owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the water for the glass, which causes it to quit the air which it held in solution, in the same manner as we see it happen when it is mixed with spirits-of-wine, with nitric acid, &c., or when salts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> are dissolved in it. For if we pour out the water which has been purged of air by boiling in vacuo, and fill the glass with fresh water, we shall observe the same thing, although a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> of the purified water was left adhering to the glass. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> air adhering to the glass.\n\nWater thus purged of air by boiling (or even without boiling) in vacuo, will again absorb air when exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. The best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of this is to fill with this water a phial, leaving about the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a> not filled. Immerse this in a vessel of water, with the mouth undermost, by which means the air-bubble will mount up to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the phial. After some days standing in this condition, the air-bubble will be completely absorbed, and the vessel quite filled with water.\n\nThe air in this state of chemical solution has lost its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, for the water is not more compressible than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> water. It is also found that water brought up from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> depth underground contains much more air than water at the surface. Indeed fountain waters differ exceedingly in this respect. The water which now comes into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> contains so much as to throw it into a considerable ebullition in vacuo. Other liquors contain much greater quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> in this loofly combined state. A glass of beer treated in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> will be almost wholly converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> by the escape of its fixed air, and will have lost entirely the prickling smartness which is so agreeable, and become quite void.\n\nThe air-pump gives us, in the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, a great variety of experiments illustrative of the air's elasticity and irritates the expansibility. The very operation of exhaustion, as it is called, is an instance of its great, and hitherto unexpansible, limited, expansibility. But this is not palpably exhibited, to view. The following experiments show it most distinctly.\n\n1st. Put a flaccid bladder, of which the neck is Experimentally tied with a thread, under a receiver, and workments the pump. The bladder will gradually swell, and will showing even be fully distended. Upon readmitting the air, the properties into its former dimensions: while the bladder is flaccid, the air within it is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> and elasticity with the surrounding air, and its elasticity balances the pressure of the atmosphere. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the air of\nof the receiver is abstracted, the remainder expands so as still to fill the receiver; but by expanding, its elasticity is plainly diminished; for we see by the fact, that the elasticity of the air of the receiver no longer balances the elasticity of that in the bladder, as it no longer keeps it in its dimensions. The air in the bladder expands also; it expands till its diminished elasticity is again in equilibrium with the diminished elasticity of the air in the receiver; that is, till its density is the same. When all the wrinkles of the bladder have disappeared, its air can expand no more, although we continue to diminish the elasticity of the air of the receiver by further rarefaction. The bladder now tends to burst; and if it be pierced by a point or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> fastened to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLIP\">flip</a>-wire, the air will rush out, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> descend rapidly in the gage.\n\nIf a phial or tube be partly filled with water, and immersed in a vessel of water with the mouth downwards, the air will occupy the upper part of the phial. If this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> be put under a receiver, and the air be abstracted, the air in the phial will gradually expand, allowing the water to run out by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> till the surface of the water be on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> within and without. When this is the case, we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> that the density and elasticity of the air in the phial is the same with that in the receiver. When we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> the pump again, we shall observe the air in the phial expand still more, and come out of the water in bubbles. Continuing the operation, we shall see the air continually escaping from the phial: when this is over, it flows that the pump can rafry no more. If we now admit the air into the receiver, we shall see the water rise into the phial, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> almost completely fill it, leaving only a very small bubble of air at top. This bubble had expanded so as to fill the whole phial. See this represented in fig. 61.\n\nEvery one must have observed a cavity at the big end of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> between the shell and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. The white and yolk are contained in a thin membrane or bladder which adheres loosely to the shell, but is detached from it at that part; and this cavity increases by keeping the egg in a dry place. One may form a judgment of its size, and therefore of the freshness of the egg, by touching it with the tongue; for the shell, where it is not in contact with the contents, will presently feel warm, being quickly heated by the tongue, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the egg will feel cold.\n\nIf a hole be made in the opposite end of the egg, and it be set on a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOD\">tripod</a>, and put under a receiver, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the air in the cavity of the egg will force the contents through the hole till the egg be quite emptied: or, if nearly one half of the egg be taken away at the other end, and the white and yolk taken out, and the shell be put under a receiver, and the air abstracted, the air in the cavity of the egg will expand, gradually detaching the membrane from the shell, till it causes it to swell out, and gives the whole the appearance of an entire egg. In like manner shrivelled apples and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> will swell in vacuo by the expansion of the air confined in their cavities.\n\nIf a piece of wood, a twig with green leaves, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, &c., be kept under water in vacuo, a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air will be extracted; and if we readmit the air into the receiver, it will force the water into the pores of the body. In this case the body will not twin in water as it did before, showing that the vegetable fibres are specifically heavier than water. It is found, however, that the air contained in the pith and bark, such as cork, is not all extricated in this way; and that much of it is contained in vessels which have no outlet: being secreted into them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of vegetation, as it is secreted into the air-bladder of fishes, where it is generally found in a pretty compressed state, considerably denser than the surrounding air. The air-bladder of a fish is surrounded by circular and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> muscles, by which the fish can compress the air still further; and, by ceasing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with them, allow it to swell out again. It is in this manner that the fish can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity to its situation in the water, so as to have no tendency either to rise or sink: but if the fish be put into the receiver of an air-pump, the rarefaction of the air obliges the fish to act more strongly with these contracting muscles, in order to adjust its specific gravity; and if too much air has been abstracted from the receiver, the fish is no longer able to keep its air-bladder in the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of compression. It becomes therefore too buoyant, and comes to the top of the water, and is obliged to struggle with its tail and fins in order to get <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; frequently in vain. The air-bladder sometimes bursts, and the fish goes to the bottom, and can no longer keep above without the continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of its tail and fins. When fishes die, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> float at top, their contractive action being now at an end.\n\nAll this may be illustrated (but very imperfectly) by a small half blown bladder, to which is appended a bit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> so heavy as to make it sink in water: when this is put under a receiver, and the air abstracted, the bubble will rise to the top; and, by nicely adjusting the rarefaction, it may be kept at any height. See fig. 62.\n\nThe playthings called Carteian devils are similar to this: they are hollow glass figures, having a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> in the lower part of the figures, as at the point of the foot; their weight is adjusted so that they swim upright in water. When put into a tall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAR\">jar</a> filled to the top, and having a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> tied over it, they will sink in the water, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> on the leather with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>: this, by compressing the water, forces some of it to enter into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and makes it heavier than the water; for which reason it sinks, but rises again on removing the pressure of the hand. See figs. 63 and 64.\n\nIf a half blown ox-bladder be put into a box, and great weights laid on it, and the whole be put under a receiver, and the air abstracted; the air will, by expanding, lift up the weights, though above an hundred pounds. See fig. 65.\n\nBy such experiments the great expansibility of the air is abundantly illustrated, as its compressibility was formerly by means of the condensing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRINGE\">syringe</a>. We now see that the two sets of experiments form an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>; and that there is no particular state of the air's density where the compressibility and expansibility are remarkably dissimilar. Air in its ordinary state expands; because its ordinary state is a state of compression by the weight of the atmosphere: and if there were a pit about 33 miles deep, the air at the bottom would probably be as dense as water; and if it were 50 miles deep, it would be as dense as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, if it did not become a liquid before this depth: nay, if a bottle with its mouth undermost were immersed five miles under water, it would probably be as dense as water; we say probably,\nprobably, for this depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of its compressibility; that is, on the relation which subsists between the compression and the force which produces it.\n\nThis is the circumstance of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, which we now proceed to examine; and it is evidently a very important circumstance. We have long ago observed, that the great compressibility and permanent fluidity of air, observed in a vast variety of phenomena, is totally inexplicable, on the supposition that the particles of air are like so many balls of sponge or so many foot-balls. Give to those what compressibility you please, common air could no more be fluid than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of clay; it could no more be fluid than a mass of such balls pressed into a box. It can be demonstrated (and indeed hardly needs a demonstration), that before a parcel of such balls, just touching each other, can be squeezed into half their present dimensions, their globular shape will be entirely gone, and each will have become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, touching six other cubes with its whole surface; and these cubes will be strongly compressed together, so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> could never be performed through among them by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body without a very great force. Whereas we know that in this state air is just as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERMEABLE\">permeable</a> to every body as the common air that we breathe. There is no way in which we can represent this fluidity to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, but by conceiving air to consist of particles, not only discrete, but distant from each other, and actuated by repulsive forces, or something analogous to them. It is an idle subterfuge, to which some naturalists have recourse, saying, that they are kept asunder by an intervening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, or elastic fluid of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. This is only removing the difficulty a step farther off; for the elasticity of this fluid requires the same explanation; and therefore it is necessary, in obedience to the rules of just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, to begin the inquiry here; that is, to determine from the phenomena what is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> between the distances of the particles and the repulsive forces exerted at these distances, proceeding in the same way as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of planetary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>. We shall learn the analogy by attending to the analogy between the compressing force and the density.\n\nFor the density depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> between the particles; the nearer they are to each other, the denser is the air. Suppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> wide and eight inches long, shut at one end, and filled with common air; then suppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUG\">plug</a> so nicely fitted to this pipe that no air can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> by its sides; suppose this piston thrust down to within an inch of the bottom: it is evident that the air which formerly filled the whole pipe now occupies the space of one cubic inch, which contains the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of particles as were formerly diffused over eight cubic inches.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> would have been the same if the air which fills a cube whose side is two inches had been squeezed into a cube of one inch, for the cube of two inches also contains eight inches. Now, in this case it is evident that the distance between the particles would be reduced to its half in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. In like manner, if a cube whose side is three inches, and which therefore contains 27 inches, be squeezed into one inch, the distance of the particles will be one-third of what it was: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> the distance of the particles will be as the cube-root of the space into which they are compressed. If the space be $\\frac{1}{8}$, $\\frac{1}{27}$, $\\frac{1}{64}$, $\\frac{1}{125}$, &c., of its former dimensions, the distance of the particles will be $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{5}$, &c. Now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> density, in its strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, expresses the vicinity of the particles; dense arbors are trees growing near each other. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of this vicinity therefore is the true measure of the density; and when 27 inches of air are compressed into one, we should say that it is three times as dense; but we say, that it is 27 times denser.\n\nDensity is therefore used in a sense different from its farthest acceptation: it expresses the comparative number of equidistant particles contained in the same bulk. This is also abundantly precise, when we compare bodies of the same kind, differing in density only; but we also say, that gold is 19 times denser than water, because the same bulk of it is 19 times heavier. This affront proceeds on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, or the fact, that every ultimate atom of terrestrial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is equally heavy: a particle of gold may contain more or fewer atoms of matter than a particle of water. In such a case, therefore, the term density has little or no reference to the vicinity of the particles; and is only a term of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of other qualities or accidents.\n\nBut when we speak of the respective densities of the same substance in its different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of compression, the word density is strictly connected with vicinity of particles, and we may safely take either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. We shall abide by the common acceptation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> that air, eight times as dense which has eight times as many particles in the same bulk, although the particles are only twice as near to each other.\n\nThus then we see, that by observing the analogy between the compressing force and the density, we shall discover the analogy between the compressing force and the distance of the particles. Now the force which is necessary for compressing two particles of air to a certain distance is a proper measure of the elasticity of the distance of particles corresponding to that vicinity or distance; for it balances it, and forces which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> must be esteemed equal. Elasticity is a distinctive name for that corporeal force which keeps the particles at that distance: therefore observations made on the analogy between the compressing force and the density of air will give us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of its corporeal force, in the same way that observations on the simultaneous deflections of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> give us the law of celestial gravitation.\n\nBut the sensible compressing forces which we are able to apply is at once exerted on unknown thousands of particles, while it is the law of action of a single particle that we want to discover. We must therefore know the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the numbers of particles on which the compressing force is exerted. It is easy to see, that since the distance of the particles is as the cube root of the density inversely, the number of particles in physical contact with the compressing surface must be as the square of this root. Thus when a cube of 8 inches is compressed into one inch, and the particles are twice as near each other as they were before, there must be four times the number of particles in contact with each of the sides of this cubical inch; or, when we have pushed down the square piston of the pipe spoken of above to within an inch of the bottom, there will be four times the number of particles immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the piston, and resisting the compression; and in order to obtain the force really exerted on one particle, and the elasticity of that particle, we must divide the whole compressing\npressing force by 4. In like manner, if we have compressed air into \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of its former bulk, and brought the particles to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of their former distance, we must divide the compressing force by 9. In general if \\( d \\) expresses the density, \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{d}} \\) will express the distance \\( x \\) of the particles; \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{d}} \\), or \\( d^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), will express the vicinity or real density; and \\( d^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\) will express the number of particles acting on the compressing surface: and if \\( f \\) expresses the accumulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> compressing force, \\( \\frac{f}{d^{\\frac{2}{3}}} \\) will express the force acting on one particle; and therefore the elasticity of that particle corresponding to the distance \\( x \\).\n\nWe may now proceed to consider the experiments by which the law of compression is to be established.\n\nThe first experiments to this purpose were those made by Mr Boyle, published in 1661 in his \"Defensio Doctrinae de A\u00ebris Elatere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONTRA\">contra</a> Linum,\" and exhibited before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> the year before. Mariotte made experiments of the same kind, which were published in 1676 in his \"Essai sur la Nature de l'Air et Trait\u00e9 des Mouvements des Eaux.\" The most copious experiments are those by Sulzer (Mem. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>. ix.), those by Fontana (Opuscula Physico-Math.), and those by Sir George Shuckburgh and Gen. Roy.\n\nIn order to examine the compressibility of air that is not rarer than the atmosphere at the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, we employ a bent tube or syphon ABCD (fig. 66.), hermetically sealed at A and open at D. The short leg <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> must be very accurately divided in the proportion of its solid contents, and fitted with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> whose units denote equal increments, not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>. There are various ways of doing this; but it requires the most scrupulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and without this the experiments are of no value. In particular, the arched form at A must be noticed. A small quantity of mercury must then be poured into the tube, and passed backwards and forwards till it stands (the tube being held in a vertical position) on a level at B and C. Then we are certain that the included air is of the same density with that of the contiguous atmosphere. Mercury is now poured into the leg DC, which will fill it, suppose to G, and will compress the air into a smaller space AE. Draw the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line EF: the new bulk of the compressed air is evidently AE, measured by the adjacent scale, and the addition made to the compressing force of the atmosphere is the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> GF. Produce GF downwards to H, till FH is equal to the height shown by a Torricellian tube filled with the same mercury; then the whole compressing force is HG. This is evidently the measure of the elasticity of the compressed air in AE, for it balances it. Now pour in more mercury, and let it rise to g, compressing the air into Ae. Draw the horizontal line ef, and make fh equal to FH; then Ae will be the new bulk of the compressed air, \\( \\frac{AB}{Ae} \\) will be its new density, and \\( \\frac{hg}{AE} \\) will be the measure of the new elasticity. This operation may be extended as far as we please, by lengthening the tube CD, and taking care that it be strong enough to resist the great pressure. Great care must be taken to keep the whole in a constant temperature, because the elasticity of air is greatly affected by heat, and the change by any increase of temperature is different according to its density or compression.\n\nThe experiments of Boyle, Mariotte, Amontons, and others, were not extended to very great compressions, the density of the air not having been quadrupled in any of them; nor do they seem to have been made with very nice apparatus. It may be collected from them generally, that the elasticity of the air is very nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to its density; and accordingly this law was almost immediately acquiesced in, and was called the Boylean law: it is accordingly assumed by almost all writers on the subject as exact. Of late years, however, there occurred questions in which it was of importance that this point should be more scrupulously settled, and the former experiments were repeated and extended. Sulzer and Fontana have carried them farther than any other. Sulzer compressed air into one-eighth of its former dimensions.\n\nConsiderable varieties and irregularities are to be observed in their experiments. It is extremely difficult to preserve the temperature of the apparatus, particularly of the leg AB, which is most handled. A great quantity of mercury must be employed; and it does not appear that philosophers have been careful to have it precisely similar to that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, which gives us the unit of compressing force and of elasticity. The mercury in the barometer should be pure and boiled. If the mercury in the syphon is adulterated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a> and tin, which it commonly is to a considerable degree, the compressing force, and consequently the elasticity, will appear greater than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. If the barometer has not been nicely fitted, it will be lower than it should be, and the compressing force will appear too great, because the unit is too small; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> will be most remarkable in the smaller compressions.\n\nThe greatest source of error and irregularity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> nature of the air itself. Air is a solvent of all fluids, all vapours, and air the perhaps of many solid bodies. It is highly improbable that the different compounds shall have the same elasticity, or even the same law of elasticity: and it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known, that air, loaded with water or other volatile bodies, is much more expansible by heat than pure air; nay, it would appear from many experiments, that certain determinate changes both of density and of temperature, cause air to let go the vapours which it holds in solution. Cold causes it to precipitate water, as appears in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>; so does rarefaction, as is seen in the receiver of an air-pump.\n\nIn general, it appears that the elasticity of air does not increase quite so fast as its density. This will be best seen by the following tables, calculated from the increase of experiments of Mr Sulzer. The column E in each fast as its feet of experiments expresses the length of the column density, GH, the unit being FH, while the column D expresses \\( \\frac{AB}{AE} \\).\nThere appears in these experiments sufficient grounds for calling in question the Boylean law; and the writer of this article thought it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on him to repeat them with some precautions, which probably had not been attended to by Mr Sulzer. He was particularly anxious to have the air as free as possible from moisture. For this purpose, having detached the short leg of the syphon, which was 3.4 inches long, he boiled mercury in it, and filled it with mercury boiling hot. He took a tinsel vessel of sufficient capacity, and put into it a quantity of powdered quicklime just taken from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILN\">kiln</a>; and having closed the mouth, he agitated the lime through the air in the vessel, and allowed it to remain there all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. He then emptied the mercury out of the syphon into this vessel, keeping the open end far within it. By this means the short leg of the syphon was filled with very dry air. The other part was now joined, and boiled mercury put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> of the syphon; and the experiment was then prosecuted with mercury which had been recently boiled, and was the same with which the barometer had been carefully filled.\n\nThe results of the experiments are expressed in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>:\n\n|        | Dry Air | Moist Air | Damp Air |\n|--------|---------|-----------|----------|\n| D      | E       | D         | E        | D       | E        |\n| 1,000  | 1,000   | 1,000     | 1,000    | 1,000   | 1,000    |\n| 2,000  | 1,957   | 2,000     | 1,920    | 2,000   | 1,909    |\n| 3,000  | 2,848   | 3,000     | 2,839    | 3,000   | 2,845    |\n| 4,000  | 3,737   | 4,000     | 3,726    | 4,000   | 3,718    |\n| 5,000  | 4,930   | 5,500     | 5,000    | 5,500   | 5,104    |\n| 6,000  | 5,342   | 6,000     | 5,452    | 6,000   | 5,403    |\n| 7,620  | 6,490   | 7,620     | 6,775    | 7,620   | 6,812    |\n\nHere it appears again in the clearest manner that the elasticities do not increase as fast as the densities, and the differences are even greater than in Mr Sulzer's experiments.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> table contains the results of experiments made on very damp air in a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. In these it appears that the elasticities are almost precisely proportional to the densities + a small constant quantity, nearly 0.11, deviating from this rule chiefly between the densities 1 and 1.5, within which limits we have very nearly $D = \\frac{E}{1.097}$. As this air is nearer to the constitution of atmospheric air than the former, this rule may be safely followed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where atmospheric air is concerned, as in measuring the depths of pits by the barometer.\n\nThe third table shows the compression and elasticity of air strongly impregnated with the vapours of camphire. Here the Boylean law appears pretty exact, or rather the elasticity seems to increase a little faster than the density.\n\nDr Hooke examined the compression of air by immersing a bottle to great depths in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and weighing the water which got into it without any escape of air. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> was liable to great uncertainty, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the unknown temperature of the sea at great depths.\n\nHitherto we have considered only such air as is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">Mode</a> of rarer than what we breathe; we must take a very different method for examining the elasticity of rarefied air.\n\nLet $gh$ (fig. 67.) be a long tube, formed at top into Fig. 67. a cup, and of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> to receive another smaller tube $af$, open at first at both ends. Let the outer tube and cup be filled with mercury, which will rise in the inner tube to the same level. Let $af$ now be stopped at $a$. It contains air of the same density and elasticity with the adjoining atmosphere. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> exactly the space $ab$ which it occupies. Draw it up into the position of fig. 68, and let the mercury stand in it at the height $de$, while $ce$ is the height of the mercury in the barometer. It is evident that the column $de$ is in equilibrium between the pressure of the atmosphere and the elasticity of the air included in the space $<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a>$. And since the weight of $ce$ would be in equilibrium with the whole pressure of the atmosphere, the weight of $cd$ is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the elasticity of the included air. While therefore $ce$ is the measure of the elasticity of the surrounding atmosphere, $cd$ will be the measure of the elasticity of the included air; and since the air originally occupied the space $ab$, and has now expanded into $ad$, we have $\\frac{ab}{ad}$ for the measure of its density. N.B.\n\n$ce$ and $cd$ are measured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> heights of the columns, but $ab$ and $ad$ must be measured by their solid capacities.\n\nBy raising the inner tube still higher, the mercury will also rise higher, and the included air will expand still farther, and we obtain another $cd$, and another $\\frac{ab}{ad}$; and in this manner the relation between the density and elasticity of rarefied air may be discovered.","sp":318,"ep":322},{"h":"THIS EXAMINATION MAY BE MANAGED MORE EASILY BY","t":"s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> may be managed more easily by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>.

Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton says, that a fluid is a body whose particles yield to the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, and by so yielding are easily moved among themselves. It may be doubted whether this be sufficiently precise; what is meant by the smallest impression? and what is easily moving? Is there any precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of impression to which they do not yield; and do they oppose any resistance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>? And a stronger objection may be made: It is not clear that a body so constituted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> exhibit all the appearances which a body acknowledged to be fluid does really exhibit. Euler offers some very plausible reasons for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOUBTING\">doubting</a> whether it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, and the complete propagation of pressure through the fluid in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and therefore prefers selecting this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> phenomenon, the propagation of pressure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUA\">aqua</a>-vertum, as the characteristic of fluidity, because a body having this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> whatever circumstances it may depend) will have every other observed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of a fluid. But this definition is hardly simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> perspicuous enough; and we think that the objections against Newton's more simple and intelligible definition are not unanswerable. Boscovich defines a fluid to be, a body whose particles exert the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> forces in all directions; and shows, that such particles must be indifferent, as to any position, with respect to each other. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> force <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on them, they will remain in every position, and will have no tendency to arrange themselves in one position rather than another; differing in this respect from the particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, or soft, or viscous bodies; which require some force to change their respective positions, and which recover their positions again when but gently disturbed. He illustrates this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> very beautifully, by comparing a parcel of balls thrown on quicksilver, and attracting each other, with a parcel of magnets in the same situation. The balls will stick together, but in any position; whereas the magnets will always affect a particular arrangement.\n\nWhen the characteristic phenomenon of fluidity has been selected, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> proceeds to combine this force and property with gravity, and establishes the doctrines of equilibrium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>, or of the pressure and equilibrium of heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, the propagation of this pressure in every direction; and demonstrates the horizontality of surface assumed by all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> fluids.\n\nThese doctrines and principles enable us to determine several very interesting circumstances respecting the mutual pressure of solids and fluids on each other; the pressures exerted on the bottoms and sides of vessels; the support and whole mechanism of floating bodies, &c.\n\nHe then considers how fluids will move when their equilibrium of pressure is destroyed; and establishes the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRAULICS\">hydraulics</a>, containing all the modifications of this motion, arising from the form of the vessels, or from the intensity or direction of the pressure which occasions it. And this subject is completed by the consideration of the resistance which fluids oppose to the motion of solid bodies through them, and their impulse on bodies opposed to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>.\n\nThese are very important matters, being the foundations of many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts, and furnishing us with some of our most convenient and efficacious powers for impelling.\nMechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>.\n\nThe importance and difficulty of these branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>.\n\nIt is evident, that on these doctrines depend the knowledge of the motions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and of waves; the buoyancy, equilibrium, and stability of ships; the motion of ships through the waters; the action of the winds on the sails; and the whole arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAMANSHIP\">seamanship</a>.\n\nThere is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> form of tangible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which exhibits very different phenomena, which are also extremely interesting; we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> that of vapour. A vapour is a fluid; and all the vapours that we know are heavy fluids: they are therefore subject to all the laws of pressure and impulse, which have been considered under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">HYDRODYNAMICS</a>. But they are susceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> compression by the action of external forces, and expand again when these forces are removed. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this compression and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, the general phenomena of fluidity receive great and important modifications; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of fluids requires a particular consideration. As <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is a familiar instance, this branch of mechanical philosophy has been called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">PNEUMATICS</a>.\n\nUnder this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> we consider the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and its effects, both on solid and fluid bodies. It produces the rise of waters or other fluids in pumps and syphons, and gives us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of their construction: it explains many curious phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, such as the motions in the atmosphere, and their connection with the pressure of the air, and its effect on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>-glass. Air, when in motion, is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>; and it may be employed to impel bodies. The theory of its action, and of its resistance to moving bodies, are therefore to be considered in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\nBut besides their motions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>, &c., such as we observe in winds, compressible or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids are susceptible of what may be termed internal motion; a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> parts are thrown into tremulous vibrations, in which they are alternately condensed and rarefied; and these undulations are propagated along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of elastic fluid, much in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which we observe waves to spread on the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. What makes this an interesting subject of consideration is, that these undulations are the more ordinary causes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. A trembling chord, or string, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>, agitates the air adjoining to it: these agitations are propagated along the air, and by its intervention agitate the organ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>. The mechanism of these undulations has been much studied, and furnishes a very beautiful theory of musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>.\n\nThe philosopher examines the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of compressibility of air and other elastic fluids; and thus gets the knowledge of the constitution of the atmosphere, and of the action of those fluids when employed to impel solid bodies. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">Gunpowder</a> contains an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of permanently elastic air, which may be set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> by inflammation. When this is done at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of a piece of ordnance, it will impel a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>, and discharge it from the muzzle, in the same way that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> is impelled by a bow. And thus having discovered in what degree this air presses in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to its expansion, we discover its action on the ball through the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the piece, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> which it will finally communicate to it. Here then is contained a theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> teaches us, that most bodies can be converted by fire into elastic fluids, which can be employed to act on other bodies in the way of pressure or impulse. Thus they come under the review of the mechanical philosopher; and they have become interesting by being employed as moving forces in some very powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>. These discussions will nearly exhaust all the general mechanical phenomena. There remain some which are much more limited, but furnish very curious and important subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>.\n\nThe phenomena exhibited between lodestones or magnets and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> attracted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; and the phenomena of which the polarity of the lodestone has been applied, namely, the directing the course of a ship through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, have rendered these phenomena extremely interesting. They are specified by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">MAGNETISM</a>. Considerable progress has been made in the arrangement and generalization of them; but we have by no means been able hitherto to bring them all under one simple fact. The attention has been too much turned to the discovery of the ultimate cause of magnetism; whereas we should have rather employed our ingenuity in discovering all the general laws, in the same manner as Kepler and Newton did with respect to the celestial phenomena, without troubling themselves with the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>. Dr Gilbert of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLCHESTER\">Colchester</a> was the first who considered the magnetic phenomena in the truly philosophical manner; and his treatise De Magnete may be considered as the first and one of the most perfect specimens of the Baconian or inductive logic. It is indeed an excellent performance; and when we consider its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, 1580, it is a wonder. AEpinus's Tentamen Theoricum Magnetismi is a most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and contains all the knowledge which we have as yet of the subject.\n\nThere is another class of mechanical phenomena which have a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with the magnetic; we mean the phenomena called ELECTRICAL. Certain bodies, when rubbed or otherwise treated, attract and repel other bodies, and occasion a great variety of sensible motions in the neighbouring bodies. Philosophers have paid much attention to these appearances of late years, and established many general laws concerning them. But we have not been more successful in bringing them all under one fact, and thus establishing a complete theory of them, than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of magnetism. Franklin and AEpinus are the authors who have been most successful in this respect. Dr Franklin in particular has acquired great celebrity by his most sagacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the phenomena; which has enabled him to establish a few general laws, almost as precise as those of Kepler, and of equally extensive influence. His discovery too of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> has given an importance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> to the whole subject.\n\nThere are many phenomena of electricity which cannot be called mechanical, and are of the most curious and interesting kind. As these have little connection with any of the other great branches of physical science, they have generally been considered in treatises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy; and along with inquiries into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> cause of electricity in general, continue to engage much of our attention.\n\nThe appearances which are presented to us by our senses\nMechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of seeing form another clas, which have always been considered as making a branch of natural philosophy in all seminaries of learning. It does not, however, ever, obviously appear, that they are mechanical phenomena of vision. The intimate nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> is still a secret.\n\nFortunately it is not necessary to be known to give us a very perfect theory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> phenomena. The general laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a> are so few, so simple, and so precise, that our theories are perhaps more perfect here than in any other branch of physics; but these theories are as yet far removed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> facts. Many unknown events happen before the phenomenon comes under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the ordinary optician, so as to become the subjects of the simple laws of reflection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a>. It may even be doubted, and has been doubted, whether the phenomena of optics are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of body in motion; whether all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> which the optician draws are any thing but the directions along which certain quantities are exerted. The side of a ball which is next the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> may be bright and the other side dark, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as the side of a ball which is next the electrical globe is minus and the other side <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLUS\">plus</a>; and all this without any intervening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a>. Apparition or visibility may be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of a body, depending on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> and position of another body, without anything between them, just as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> is; and this quality may be cognizable by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of seeing alone, just as the pressure of a heavy body is by our feeling alone.\n\nThe first thing which made it probable that mechanical philosophy had anything to do with the phenomena of optics, was the discovery of Mr Roemer, \"that appearance was not instantaneous,\" that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> elapsed between the illumination of a body and its being seen at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. He discovered, that it was not till 40 minutes after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> illuminated one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites that it was seen by an inhabitant of this globe. If therefore a sun were just created, it would be 45 minutes before Jupiter would be illuminated by him, and 200 before the Georgian planet would be illuminated. Here then is motion. It is therefore highly probable that there is something moved; but it is still doubted whether this something, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> light, is a matter emitted from the shining body, and moving with great velocity, and acting on and affected by other bodies, in the various phenomena of optics, or whether it is a certain state of a medium which is thus propagated, as we see that waves are propagated along the surface of water, or porous undulations through the mass of air, while the water or air itself is hardly moved out of its place. Either of these suppositions makes optics a legitimate branch of mechanical philosophy; and it is the philosopher's business to examine both by the received laws of motion, and see which of them gives consequences which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> with the phenomena. This has been done; and we imagine that a complete incompatibility has been demonstrated between the consequences of the undulations of an elastic medium, and the phenomena of optics; while the consequences of the other or vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> on this subject are perfectly consistent with mechanical laws. There are some things in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> very far beyond our power to conceive distinctly; but they are all similar in this respect to many facts acknowledged by all; and there is no phenomenon that is inconsistent with the legitimate consequences of the hypothesis. This gives it great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>; and this probability is confirmed by many chemical facts, and by facts in the vegetable economy, which give strong and almost undeniable indications of light being a body capable of a chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with the other ingredients of sublunary bodies, and of being afterwards set at liberty under its own form, as the cause or medium of vision.\n\nBut these are questions similar to those about the cause of gravity, and totally unnecessary for establishing a complete theory of the optical phenomena, for explaining the nature of vision, the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-OPTICAL_INSTRUMENTS\">optical instruments</a>, the cause of colours, the phenomena of the rainbow, halos and parhelia, &c., &c., &c. Only all this theory is connected with the principles called mechanical.\n\nSuch is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> to the mechanical philosopher of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. We may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to extend it, and by degrees apply its doctrines even to the unfeeling motions which take place in chemistry and physiology. But we must, in the first place, perfect our knowledge of the field of observation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the feasible motions and actions of bodies. Those of fluids still demand much investigation; and till these are thoroughly understood, it is not time to attempt penetrating further into the recesses of nature.\n\nIn the prosecution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, it is found that every change which can be observed in the state of a body, with respect to motion by the action of another body, is accompanied by an equal and opposite change in the state of that other body. Thus, in the phenomena of equal gravitation, it is observed that the deflections of the sun opposite to and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> are mutual. The same thing is observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a>, the actions of magnets on each other and on iron; it is also observed in the attractions and repulsions of electrical bodies; and it also obtains in all the phenomena of impulse and of corporeal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a>. It is therefore an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> law of motion, that action is always equal and opposite to reaction; but this must be considered merely as a matter of fact, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> law of nature, like that of gravitation. The contrary is perfectly conceivable, and involves no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>. That this is so, is evident from the proceedings of philosophers, who in every new case make it their business to discover by experiment whether this law was observed or not. It was among the last discoveries made by Sir Isaac Newton in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of celestial motions. This being the case, it should never be assumed as a principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> till its operation has been ascertained by observation.\n\nIt has been owing to this improper procedure that much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> reasoning has been introduced into mechanical philosophy, and particularly into the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> or much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion by impulse. In considering this subject, a term has been introduced which has occasioned much wrangling and misconception; we mean the term <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a>. It serves indeed to abbreviate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, but it has often misled the judgement. When used with cautious attention to every circumstance, it expresses nothing but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a cause to the production of any effect; but it is generally used as expressing a quality inherent in matter, by which it resists any change of state, or by which it maintains its present state. Matter is said to be inert; and as every thing which changes the motion of a body is called a force, and as this inertia of A is supposed to change the motion of B, it is called vis inertiae; and yet matter is said to be indifferent as to motion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, and to be inactive. These are...\nMechanical are surely very incongruous expressions. This obscure philosophy, discourse has arisen from the poverty of all languages, which are deficient in original terms, and therefore employ figurative ones. Force, action, resistance, are all appropriated terms related to our own exertions; and some resemblance between the external effects of these exertions and the effects of the connecting qualities of natural bodies, has made us <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> them in our disquisitions on these subjects. And as we are conscious that, in order to prevent our being pushed by another from our place, we must resist, exerting force; and that our resistance is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why this other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> has not accomplished his purpose, we say, that the quiescent body resists being put in motion, and that its inertia is discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> made in the motion of the impelling body: and upon the authority of this vis inertiae as a first principle, the phenomena of impulsion are explained, and the law of equal action and reaction is established.\n\nBut all this procedure is in contradiction to the rules of inductive logic; and the obscurity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> which has arisen from this original misconception, the consequent incongruity of language, and the awkward attempts that have been made to botch and accommodate it to the real state of things, have occasioned a dispute, and the only dispute, in natural philosophy which has not yet been settled, and never can be settled, while such misconceptions are allowed to remain.\n\nIf the word inertia be taken as expressing not a quality of matter, but a law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> judgment respecting matter, as expressing our necessity of inferring the agency of a moving force whenever we observe a change of motion, all difficulties will vanish, and the equality of action and reaction will be inferred, as it should be, from the phenomena of collision. There will be inferred a vis inusta corpori impellenti, not quid movendi, but quid corpori; and this inference will carry us through all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of corporeal action, as it conducted Sir Isaac Newton in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> researches.\n\nLet us just consider how we reason in a new case. Let A and B be two magnets fastened on the ends of two long wooden laths AE, BF, which turn horizontally on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PIVOTS\">pivots</a> C, D, like compass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> facing each other, 12 inches apart; and let A be pushed towards B, so that it would move uniformly with the velocity of two inches in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>. The phenomena which have been observed are as follow: A will gradually diminish its velocity; and when it has advanced about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches, will stop completely. B, in the mean time will gradually acquire motion; and when it has advanced about nine inches, will have a velocity of about two inches per second, with which it will continue to move uniformly. Now what is inferred from these phenomena? Because the motion of A is gradually retarded, we infer that a retarding force, that is, a force in the direction BA, has acted on it. And since this would not have happened if B had not been there, and always happens when B is there, we infer that B is either its cause or the occasion of its action.\n\nThe vulgar say that B repels A; so say the dynamists. The abettors of invisible fluids say, that a stream of fluid issuing from B impels A in the opposite direction. All naturalists agree in saying, that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> force connected with B has destroyed the motion of A, and consider this curious phenomenon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> and characteristic of a discovery. The same inference is made from the motion produced in B: it is considered by all as effected by a force exerted or occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of A; and the dynamists and the vulgar say that A repels B. And both parties conclude, from the equal changes made on both bodies, that the changing forces are equal; here acknowledging, that they observe an equality of action and reaction; and they add this to the other instances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of this law of motion.\n\nAll this while no one thinks of the inertia or inactivity of B, but, on the contrary, conclude this to be a curious instance of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>; and most people conclude that both bodies carry about with them a vis inertiae both when at rest and when in motion.\n\nIf other phenomena give unquestionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> it is doubted that, in ordinary collisions, there is the same changeful whether of motion, produced without mathematical contact, the fact has same inferences must be drawn; and a scrupulous nature ever been ralif will doubt whether contact should make any change observed, in our reasonings on the subject, and whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> contact ever has been or can be observed. He will also be convinced, that while this is the general, or perhaps universal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of nature in producing motion by impulse, all explanations of the action of bodies &c. &c., &c., by the intervention of ethers and other invisible fluids, or supposing nothing but multiplying the difficulties; for in place of one fact, the approach of one magnet (for instance) ethers, &c., to another, they substitute millions of unseen impulses, each of which equally needs an explanation. And if this fluid be supposed to produce its effects by any peculiarity in its constitution, as in the case of Newton's elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> propounded by him to explain gravitation, the hypothesis substitutes, in the most unqualified manner, millions of similar phenomena for the one to be explained; for there is the same want of a second fluid in order to produce that mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of the particles of the ether which constitutes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>.\n\nAnd this seems to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> to our inquiries into the quality all the classes of natural phenomena. We find the mass of bodies or the particles of matter endowed in fact with qualities which affect the state of other particles or masses, at other bodies smaller or at greater distances from each other according to certain general rules or laws. This ultimate step is taken by us, the constitution of things is inferutable by us. It is arrogance in the highest degree for us to say, that because we do not comprehend how there is inherent in a body any quality by which another body may be affected at any distance from it, therefore no such quality is possible. It is no less for us to say, that matter has no active property but that of moving other matter by impulse; and that because it may be so moved, and also by the agency of our own minds, therefore, when it is not moved by impulse, it is moved by minds. The same almighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIAT\">fiat</a> which brought a particle of matter into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> could bring those qualities equally into existence; and the law in both is equally beyond our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>.\n\nBut, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the not, however curious relying on this consideration as a stop to further, deeper inquiry. There may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of matter possible further inquiries.\nMechanical fed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL_POWERS\">mechanical powers</a>, and which notwithstanding-\ning is not cognizable by our senses. All the properties of matter are not known to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who is both deaf and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>; and beings possessed of more senses may perceive matter where we do not; and many phenomena may really be produced by the action of intervening matter, which we, from indolence or from haste, ascribe to the agency of inherent forces. The industry of philosophers has already discovered intermediate in some cases. It is now certain that air is the conveyer of sound, and it is almost certain that there is such a thing as light. Let us therefore indulge conjectures of this kind, and examine the conjectures by the received laws of motion, and reject them when we find the smallest inconsistency; and always keep in mind that even the most coincident with the phenomena is still but a possibility.\n\nWe may conclude the whole of these observations with the remark, that these questions about the activity or inactivity of matter are not physical, but metaphysical. Natural philosophy, it is true, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> takes it for granted that matter is wholly inactive; but it is not at any moment in physics whether this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> be true or false; whether matter be acted on according to certain laws, or whether it act of itself according to the same laws, makes no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to the natural philosopher. It is his business to discover the laws which really obtain, and to apply these to the solution of subordinate phenomena; but whether these laws arise from the nature of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> external to matter, or whether matter itself is the agent, are questions which may be above his comprehension, and do not immediately concern his proper business.\n\nThe account we have now given of natural philosophy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out to us in the plainest manner the way in which the study must be prosecuted, and the helps which must be taken from other branches of human knowledge.\n\nThe causes, powers, forces, or by whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> we choose to express them, which produce the mechanical phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, are not observed, and are known to us only in the phenomena themselves. Our knowledge of the mechanical powers of nature must therefore keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with our knowledge of the motions, and indeed is nothing different from it. In order to discover and determine the forces by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> is retained in her orbit round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, we must know her motions. To a terrestrial spectator she appears to describe an ellipse, having the earth in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>; but, in the mean time, the earth is carried round the sun, and the moon's real path, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> space, is a much more complicated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Till we know this figure, and the variations in the velocity with which it is described, we know nothing of the forces which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUATE\">actuate</a> the moon in her orbit.\n\nWhen Newton says that the forces by which she is retained in this elliptical orbit are directed to the earth, what does he mean? Only this, that the deflections from that uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> motion which she would otherwise have performed are always in this direction. In like manner, when he says that these forces are inversely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the squares of their distances from the earth, he only means that the deflections made in equal times in different parts of her motion are in this proportion.\n\nThese deflections are considered as the characteristics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the forces. We imagine that we have made all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> when we call this indicated cause a tendency to the earth; but we have no notion of this tendency to the earth different from the approach itself. This word tendency, so fashionable among the followers of Sir Isaac Newton, is perverted from its pure and original sense. Tendere versus sollem, is, in the language of Rome, and also of Newton, to go towards the sun; but we now use the words tend, tendency, to signify, not the approach, but the cause of this approach. And when called upon to speak still plainer, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> the safe paths of plain language, and we express ourselves by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>; speaking of nufus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONATUS\">conatus</a> sepe mutua accedende, vis centripeta, &c. When these expressions have become familiar, the original sense of the word is forgotten, and we take it for granted that the words never had another meaning; and this metaphor, sprung from the poverty of language, becomes a fruitful source of misconception and mistake. The only way to secure ourselves against such mythical notions as are introduced by these means into philosophy, is to have recourse to the way in which we acquire the knowledge of these fancied powers; and then we see that their names are only names for phenomena, and that universal gravitation is only a universal mutual approach among the parts of the solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>.\n\nThere is one case in which we fondly imagine that we know the cause independent of the effect, and that if we could have predicted the phenomenon a priori, we should mean the case of impulse: and hence it is that we are prone to reduce every thing to cases of impulsion, and that we have fallen upon all these subterfuges of ethers and other subtle fluids. But we might have saved ourselves all this trouble; for after having by much false reasoning and gratuitous assumptions, shown that the phenomenon in question might have been produced by impulse, we are no nearer our purpose, because that property by which matter in motion puts other matter in motion, is known to us only by and in the effect.\n\nThe fair and logical deduction from all this is, that we must not expect any knowledge of the powers of nature, the immediate causes of the motions of bodies, but by means of a knowledge of the motions themselves; and that every mistake in the motions is accompanied by a similar mistake in the causes. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to demonstrate or explain the gravitation of the planets to him who is ignorant of the properties of the ellipse, or the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNNERY\">gunnery</a> to him who does not know the parabola.\n\nA notion has of late gained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, that a man may become a natural philosopher without mathematical knowledge; but this is entertained by none who have any acquaintance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> themselves; and surely those who are ignorant of mathematics should not be trusted as judges in this matter. We need only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to fact. It is only in mathematical parts of natural philosophy which have been mathematically treated, that the investigations have been carried on with certainty, success, and utility. Without this guide, we must expect nothing but a school-boy's knowledge, resembling that of the man who takes up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> creed on the authority of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, and can neither give a reason for what he imagines that he believes.\nMechanical philosophy, nor apply it with confidence to any valuable purpose in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. We may read and be amused with the trifling or vague writings of a Nollet, a Ferguson, or a Priestley; but we shall not understand, or profit by the truths communicated by a Newton, a D'Alembert, or De la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANGE\">Grange</a>.\n\nThese observations, on the other hand, show us the nature of the knowledge which may be acquired, and the rank which natural philosophy holds among the sciences.\n\nMotions are the real and only objects of our observation, the only subjects of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>. In motion are included no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> but those of space and time, the subjects of pure mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>. As soon, therefore, as we have discovered the fact, the motion, all our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> reasonings about this motion are purely mathematical, depending only on the affections of figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and proportion, and must carry along with them that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> and irresistible evidence which is the boast of that science. To this are we indebted for that accuracy which is attained, and the progress which has been made in some branches of mechanical philosophy; for when the motions are distinctly and minutely understood, and then considered only as mathematical quantities, independent of all physical considerations, and we proceed according to the just rules of mathematical reasoning, we need not fear any intricacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> or multiplicity of steps; we are certain that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> will accompany us, even though we do not always attend to it, and will emerge in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> proposition, in the same manner as we see happen in a long and intricate algebraic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>.\n\nMechanical philosophy, therefore, which is cultivated in this way, is not a system of probable opinions, but a disciplina accurata, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATIVE\">demonstrative</a> science. To profess it, however, in this form, requires considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a> are by no means sufficient. Newton could not have proceeded sine \"fua mathesi faciem preferente;\" and, in creating a new science of physics, he was obliged to search for and discover a new source of mathematical knowledge. It is to be lamented that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the mathematical sciences has so prodigiously declined in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of late years; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, which formerly took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> in natural philosophy, should now be the country where they are least cultivated. Few among us know more than a few elementary doctrines of equilibrium: while, on the continent, we find many authors who cultivate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian philosophy</a> with great assiduity and success, and whose writings are consulted as the fountains of knowledge by all our countrymen who have occasion to employ the discoveries in natural philosophy in the arts of life. It is to the foreign writers that we have recourse in our seminaries, even for elementary treatises; and while the continent has supplied us with most elaborate and useful treatises on various articles, in physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, hydraulics, and optics, there has not appeared in Britain half a dozen treatises worth consulting for these last forty years; and this notwithstanding the unparalleled munificence of our present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, who has given more liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> to the cultivators of mathematical philosophy, and indeed of science in general, than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The magnificent establishments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. originated mechanical from his infatuated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> and desire of universal influence, directed by the sagacious Colbert. And his patronage being exerted according to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> in the establishment of pensioned academics, and in procuring the combined efforts of the most eminent of all countries, his exertions made a conspicuous figure, and filled all Europe with his eulogists. But all this was done without the smallest self-denial, or retrenchment of his own pleasures, the expenses being furnished out of the public revenues of a great and oppressed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; whereas the voyages of discovery, the expensive observations and geodetical operations in Britain, and the numberless unheard-of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENSIONS\">pensions</a> and encouragements given to men of science and activity, were all furnished out of the private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> of our excellent sovereign, who seems to delight in repaying, by every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in his power, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of a loyal and happy nation. It is therefore devoutly to be wished that his patriotic efforts were properly seconded by those whom they are intended to serve, and that the taste for the mathematical sciences may again turn the eyes of Europe to this country for instruction and improvement. The present seems a most favourable era, while the amazing advances in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of every kind seem to call aloud for the affluence of the philosopher. What <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> would it have given to Newton or Halley to have seconded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> efforts of a Watt, a Boulton, a Smeaton, an Arkwright, a Dollond? and how mortifying is it to see them indebted to the services of a Belidor, a Boilat, a Clairaut, a Bofcovitch?\n\nWe hope to be pardoned for this digression, and return to our subject.\n\nIt appears from what has been said, that mechanical philosophy is almost wholly a mathematical study, philosophy and that it is to be successfully prosecuted only under a whole this form: but in our endeavours to initiate the young mathematician, it will be often found to require more steadiness of thought than can generally be expected for keeping the mind engaged in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> speculations. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> presented to the mind is not readily apprehended with that vivacity which is necessary for enabling us to reason upon it with clearness and steadiness, and it would be very desirable to have some means of rendering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> more easy, and the attention more lively. This may be done by exhibiting to the eye an experiment, which, though but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>'s, single fact, gives us a sensible object of perception, however, which we can contemplate and remember with much more steadiness than any mere creature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. We could, by an accurate description, give young such a conception of a room that the hearer should minds perfectly comprehend our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> of any occurrence in it: but one moment's glance at the room would be infinitely better. It is usual therefore to employ experiments to assist the imagination of the beginner; and most courses of natural philosophy are accompanied by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of such experiments. Such experiments, connected by a flight train of argumentative discourse, may even serve to give a notion of the general doctrines, sufficient for an elegant amusement, and even tending to excite curiosity and engage in a serious prosecution of the study. Such are the usual courses which go by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a>; but this is\nEXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY is the investigation of general laws, as yet unknown, by experiment; and it has been observed, under the article PHILOSOPHY, that this is the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> (and indeed the sole) way of arriving at the knowledge of them. This is the Novum Organum Scientiarum strongly recommended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>. It was new in his time, though not altogether without example; for it is the procedure of nature, and is followed whenever curiosity is excited.\n\nThere was even extant in his time a very beautiful example of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, viz. the Treatise of the Loadstone, by Dr Gilbert of Colchester; a work which has hardly been excelled by any, and which, when we consider its date, about the year 1580, is really a wonderful performance.\n\nThe most perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of this method is the Optics of Sir Isaac Newton. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNESIA\">Magnesia</a> is another very perfect example. Dr Franklin's Theory of Electricity is another example of great merit. That the investigation is not complete, nor the conclusions certain, is not an objection. The method is without fault; and a proper direction is given to the mind for the experiments which are still necessary for establishing the general laws.\n\nIt were much to be wished that some person of talents and of extensive knowledge would give a treatise on the method of inquiry by experiment. Although many beautiful and successful examples have been given as particular branches of inquiry, we have but too many instances of very inaccurate and inconclusive investigations. Experiments made at random, almost without a view, serve but little to advance our knowledge. They are like shapeless lumps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> merely detached from the rock, but still wanting the skill of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDER\">builder</a> to select them for the different purposes which they may chance to serve; while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-contrived experiments are blocks cut out by a skilful workman, according as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> could furnish them, and of forms suited to certain determined uses in the future edifice. Every little series of experiments by Margraff terminates in a general law, while hardly any general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> can be drawn from the numberless experiments of Pott. Lord Bacon has written much on this subject, and with great judgment and acuteness of distinction; but he has exceeded in this, and has fatigued his readers by his numerous rules; and there is in all his philosophical works, and particularly in this, a quaintness and affectation that greatly obscure his meaning, so that this most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his writings is very little read.\n\nA formidable objection has been made to this method of inquiry. Since a physical law is only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of a general fact, and is established only in consequence of our having observed a similarity in a great number of particular facts; and since the great rule of inductive logic is to give the law no greater extent than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> on which it is founded\u2014how comes it that a few experiments must be received as the foundation of a general inference? This has been answered in very general terms in the article PHILOSOPHY. But it will be of use to consider the subject a little more particularly. Our observations on this subject are taken from the dissertation on evidence by Dr Campbell in his Philosophy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>.\n\nAn attentive consideration of the objects around us, will inform us that they are generally of a complicated nature, not only as consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of those qualities of things called accidents, such as gravity, mobility, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all bodies; but also as consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of flowing the variety of substances, very different in their nature and properties; and each of these is perhaps compounded of ingredients more simple.\n\nMoreover, the farther we advance in the knowledge of nature, we find the more reason to be convinced of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> in all her operations. Like causes have always produced like effects, and like effects have always been preceded by like causes. Inconstancy sometimes appears in Nature's works at first sight; but a more refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> shows us that this is but an appearance, and that there is no inconstancy: and we explain it to our satisfaction in this way.\n\nMost of the objects being of a complicated nature, we find, on an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a>, that the effects attributed to them ought often to be solely ascribed to one or more of these component parts, while the others either do not contribute to them, or hinder their production; and the variety of nature is so great, that hardly any two individuals of the same species are in every respect like any other. On all these accounts we expect difficulties in the phenomena accompanying perfectly similar treatment of different subjects of the same kind; but we find, that whenever we can be assured that the two substances are perfectly alike, the phenomena arising from similar treatment are the same: and long and extensive observation teaches us, that there are certain circumstances which insure us in the perfect similarity of constitution of some things. Whenever we observe the effect of any natural agent on one, and but one, of these, we invariably expect that the same will be produced on any other.\n\nShould a botanist meet with a plant new to him, and observe that it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> monopetalous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, he will conclude with the utmost confidence that every plant of this species will have monopetalous flowers; but he will not suppose that it will have seven, and no more than seven, flowers. Now these two facts seem to have no difference to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> such a difference in the conclusion; which may therefore seem capricious, since there is but one example of both.\n\nBut it is not from this example only that he draws the conclusion. Had he never before taken notice of any plant, he would not have reasoned at all from these remarks. But his mind runs immediately from this unknown species to all the known species of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>, and to all the genera of the same order; and having experienced in the figure of the flower an uniformity in every species, genus, and order, which admits of no exception, but, in the number of flowers, a variety as boundless as are the circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and culture, he learns to mark the difference, and draws the above-mentioned conclusions. Thus we learn, that perfect uniformity is not to be expected in any instance whatever, because in no instance is the simplicity of constitution sufficiently great to give us assurance of perfect uniformity in the circumstances of the case; and the ut-\nmost that our experience can teach us is a quick differentiation of those circumstances which produce the occasional varieties.\n\nThe nearer that our investigations carry us to the knowledge of elementary natures, the more are we convinced by general experience of the uniformity of the operations of real elements; and although it may perhaps be impossible for us ever to arrive at the knowledge of the simplest elements of any body, yet when anything appears simple, or rather so exactly uniform, as that we have invariably observed it to produce similar effects on discovering any new effect of this substance, we conclude, from a general experience of the efficient, a like constancy in the energy as to the reft. Fire consumes wood, melts lead, and hardens clay. In these instances it acts uniformly, but not in these only. We have always found, that whatever of any species is consumed by it in one instance, has been consumed by it on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> at any time. If therefore a trial be made for the first time of its influence on any particular substance, he who makes it is warranted to conclude that the effect, whatever it may be, is a faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of its effects on this substance in all past and future ages. This conclusion is not founded on this single instance, but upon this instance combined with the general experience of the regularity of this element in its operations.\n\nThis general conclusion, therefore, drawn from one experiment, is by no means in opposition to the great rule of inductive logic, but, on the contrary, it is the most general and refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of it. General laws are here the real subject of consideration; and a law still more general, viz. that nature is constant in all its operations, is the inference which is here applied as a principle of explanation of a phenomenon which is itself a general law, viz. that nature is constant in this operation.\n\nThe foundation of this general inference from one experiment being so firmly established, it is evident that experiments must be an infallible method of attaining to the knowledge of nature; and we need only be solicitous that we proceed in a way agreeable to the great rule of inductive logic; that is, the subject must be cleared of every accidental and unknown circumstance, and put into a situation that will reduce the interfering circumstance to a state of the greatest possible simplicity. Thus we may be certain that the event will be a faithful representative of every similar case; and unless this be done in the preparation, nothing can result from the most numerous experiments but uncertainty and mistakes.\n\nThe account which has been given of mechanical philosophy would seem to indicate that experiment was not of much use in the farther prosecution of it. The two laws of motion, with the affluence of mathematics, seem fully adequate to the explanation of every phenomenon; and so they are to a certain degree. But this degree is as yet very limited. Our mathematical knowledge, great as it is in comparison with that of former times, is still insufficient for giving accurate solutions even of very simple (comparatively speaking) questions. We can tell, with the utmost precision, what will be the motions of two particles of matter, or two bodies, which act on each other with forces proportioned to the squares of the distances inversely; but if we add a third particle, or a third body, acting by the same law, the unit experimental science of all Europe can only give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to the solution.\n\nWhat is to be done then in the cases which come continually before us, where millions of particles are experiment acting at once on each other in every variety of situation and distance? How shall we determine, for instance, the motion of water through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLUICE\">sluice</a> when urged by a piston or by its own weight? what will be its velocity and direction? It is impossible, in the present state of mathematical knowledge, to tell with any precision or certainty. And here we must have recourse to experiment. But if this be the case, must the experiment be made in every possible variety of situation, depth, figure, pressure? or is it possible to find out any general rules, founded on the general laws of motion, and rationally deduced from them? Or, if this cannot be accomplished, will experiment itself furnish any general coincidences which show such mutual dependences, that we may consider them as indications of general principles, though subordinate, complicated, and perhaps irrefutable? This can be discovered by experiment alone.\n\nThe attention of philosophers has been directed to accurate each of these three chances, and considerable progress experiment has been made in them all. Numerous experiments not always have been made, almost sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the practice be made, in many important cases, without the help of any rule or principle whatever. But there are many cases, and these of by far the greatest importance, such as the motion of a ship impelled by the winds, resisted by the water, and tossed by the waves, where distinct experiments cannot be made.\n\nNewton, Bernoulli, d'Alembert, and others, have laboured hard to deduce from the laws of motion rules necessary for determining what may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> motion of water in these circumstances, without attempting to define the path or motion of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> particle; and they have actually deduced many rules which have a great degree of probability. It may here be asked, why do you say probability? the rules, as far as they go, should be certain. So they are: they are first deductions from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>. But the premises are only suppositions, of various degrees of probability, assumed in order to simplify the circumstances of the case, and to give room for mathematical reasoning; therefore these deductions, these rules, must be examined by experiment. Some of the suppositions are such as can hardly be refused, and the rules deduced from them are found to tally precisely with the phenomena. Such is this, \"that the velocities of inflowing water in similar circumstances are in the sub-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the pressures.\" And this rule gives a most important and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> to the engineer. Other suppositions are more gratuitous, and the rules deduced from them are less coincident with the phenomena. The patient and sagacious Newton has repeatedly failed in his attempts to determine what is the absolute velocity of water inflowing from a hole in the bottom of a vessel when urged by its weight alone, and the attempts of the others have hardly succeeded better. Experiment is therefore absolutely necessary on this head.\n\nThose who have aimed at the discovery of rules purely experimental on this subject, have also been pretty successful; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> Buat has, from a comparison,\nExperiments on an immense variety of experiments made by himself and various authors, deduced an empirical rule, which will not be found to deviate from truth above one part in ten in any case which has yet come to our knowledge.\n\nThis instance may serve to show the use of experiments in mechanical philosophy. It is proper in all cases by way of illustration; and it is absolutely necessary in most, either as the foundation of a characteristic of a particular class of phenomena, or as argument in support of a particular doctrine. Hydrostatics, hydraulics, pneumatics, magnetism, electricity, and optics, can hardly be studied in any other way; and they are at present in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> state, and receiving continual improvement by the labours of experimental philosophers in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the world.\n\nHaving in the preceding paragraphs given a pretty full enumeration of the different subjects which are to be considered in the study of natural philosophy, it will not be necessary to spend much time in a detail of the advantages which may reasonably be expected from a successful prosecution of this study. It stands in no need of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a>: its intimate connection with the arts gives it a sufficient recommendation to the attention of every person. It is the foundation of many arts, and it gives liberal assistance to all. Indebted to them for its origin and birth, it has ever retained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> attachment, and repaid all their favours with the most partial affection.\n\nTo this science the navigator must have recourse for that astronomical knowledge which enables him to find his place in the trackless ocean; and although very small scraps of this knowledge are sufficient for the mere pilot, it is necessary that the study be prosecuted to the utmost by some persons, that the unlearned pilot may get that scanty pittance which must direct his routine. The few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of tables of the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a>, which he uses every day to find his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, required the successive and united labours of all the astronomers of Europe to make them tolerably exact: and in order to ascertain his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> with precision, it required all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of a Newton to detect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> irregularities, and bring them within the power of the calculator; and, till this was done, the reflexive position of the different parts of the earth could not be ascertained. Vain would have been the attempt to do this by geodetical surveys independent of astronomical observation. It is only from the most refined mechanics that we can hope for sure principles to direct us in the construction and management of a ship, the boast of human art, and the great means of union and communication between the different quarters of the globe.\n\nA knowledge of mechanics not much inferior to this is necessary for enabling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> to execute some of his greatest works, such as the erection of domes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, which depend on the nicest adjustment of equilibrium. Without this he cannot unite economy with strength; and his works must either be clumsy masses or flimsy shells.\n\nThe effects of artillery cannot be understood or secured without the same knowledge.\n\nThe whole employment of the engineer, civil or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a>, is a continual application of almost every branch of mechanical knowledge; and while the promises of a Smeaton, a Watt, a Belidor, may be confided in as if already performed, the numberless failures and disappointments in the most important and costly projects show us daily the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the pretended crowd of engineers.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine, the thunder-rod, are preludes which the world has received from the natural philosopher; and although the compass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a> were the productions of chance, they would have been of little service had they not been studied and improved by Gilbert, Halley, and Dollond.\n\nBut it is not in the arts alone that the influence of natural philosophy is perceived: it lends its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> to every science, and in every study.\n\nIt is often necessary to have recourse to the philosopher in disputes concerning property; and many examples might be given where great injustice has been the consequence of the ignorance of the judges. Knowledge of nature might have prevented many disgraceful condemnations for forgery.\n\nThe historian who is ignorant of natural philosophy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, easily admits the miraculous into his narrations, accompanies these with his reflections, draws consequences from them, and fills his pages with prodigies, fables, and absurdity.\n\nIt is almost needless to speak of the advantages which will accrue to the physician from this study. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> is the connection between it and medicine, that our language has given but one name to the naturalist and to the medical philosopher. Indeed, the whole of his study is a close observation of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> nature, in order to draw from them precepts to direct his practice in the noble art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALING\">healing</a>. During the immaturity of general knowledge, while natural philosophy was the only study which had acquired any just pretension to certitude either in its principles or method of investigation, the physicians endeavoured to bring the objects of their study within its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, hoping by this means to get a more distinct view of it; and they endeavoured to explain the arbitrary phenomena of the animal functions by reducing them all to motions, vibrations, collisions, impulses, hydrostatic and hydraulic pressures and actions, with which the mechanical philosophers were so ardently occupied at that time. But unfortunately their acquaintance with nature was then very limited, and they were but little habituated to the rules of just reasoning; and their attempts to explain the economy of animal life by the laws of mechanics did them but little service either for the knowledge of diseases or of the methods of cure. The mechanical theories of medicine, which had considerable reputation about the end of the 17th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, were many of them very ingenious, and had an imposing appearance of symmetry and connection; but are now forgotten, having all been formed on the narrow supposition that matter was subject only to mechanical laws.\n\nBut the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> diminishes the chance of again going wrong, especially when the cause of error has been discovered, and the means pointed out of detecting the mistakes; and the vital principle must combine its influence with, or operate on, the properties of rude matter. It appears therefore evident that a knowledge of the mechanical laws of the material world is not only a convenient, but a necessary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> to\nWe are fully justified in this opinion, by observing medical authors of the present day introducing into medicine theories borrowed from mechanical philosophy, which they do not understand, and which they continually misapply. Appearance of reasoning frequently conceals the errors in principle, and seldom fails to mislead.\n\nBut there is no class of men to whom this science is of more service than to those who hold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> office of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. Their knowledge in their own science, and their public utility, are prodigiously hurt by ignorance of the general frame and constitution of nature; and it is much to be lamented that this science is so generally neglected by them, or considered only as an elegant accomplishment; nay, it is too frequently thought as a dangerous attainment, as likely to unhinge their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and taint the minds of their hearers. We hope, however, that few are either so feebly rooted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of the great doctrines of religion as to fear this, or of minds so base and corrupted as to adopt and inculcate a belief which they have any suspicion of being ill-founded. But many have a sort of horror at all attempts to account for the events of nature by the intervention of general causes, and think this procedure derogatory to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> nature, and inconsistent with the doctrine of his particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>; believing, that \"a sparrow does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the ground without the knowledge of our heavenly Father.\" Their limited conceptions cannot perceive, that, in forming the general law, the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">Artist</a> did at one glance see it in its remotest and most minute consequence, and adjust the vast assemblage so as completely to answer every purpose of His providence. There never was a more eager enquirer into the laws of nature, or more ardent admirer of its glorious Author, than the Hon. Robert Boyle. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> says, that he will always think more highly of the skill and power of that artist who should construct a machine, which, being once set a going, would of itself continue its motion for ages, and from its inherent principles continue to answer all the purposes for which it was first contrived, than of him whose whole machine required the continual aid of the hand which first constructed it. It is owing to great inattention that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to the operation of secondary causes has any influence on our mind. What do we mean by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of secondary causes? How do we infer the agency of any cause whatever? Would we ever have supposed any cause of the operations of nature, had they gone on without any order or regularity? Or would such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a> of events, any more than a chaos of existences, have given us any notion of a forming and directing hand? No surely. We see the hand of God in the regular and unvaried course of nature, only because it is regular and unvaried. The philosopher expresses this by saying, that the phenomena proceed by unalterable laws. Greatly mistaken therefore are they who think that we superfluous the existence of mind and of providence when we trace things to their causes. A physical law being an unvaried fact, is an indication, and the strongest possible indication, of an unerring mind, who is incapable of change, and must do to day what He always did: for to change is to deviate from what is best*. The operations of unerring mind will therefore be regular and invariable. Physical laws, therefore, or secondary causes, are the best proofs of unerring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. Such regularity of conduct is universally considered as an indication of wisdom among men. The wise man is known by the constancy of his conduct, while no man can depend on the future conduct of a fool.\n\nAnd what astonishing evidences of wisdom do we not observe in the general laws of the material world? They will ever be considered by the intelligent philosopher as the most glorious display of inconceivable wisdom, which has been able, by means so few and so simple, to produce effects which by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> astonish our feeble understandings, and by their inexhaustible variety elude all possibility of enumeration.\n\nWhile the teachers of religion remain ignorant of the beautiful laws of nature, the great characteristics of the wisdom and goodness of the Almighty Creator, their hearers are deprived of much sublime pleasure; God is robbed of that praise which he would have received from an enlightened people; and the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> he receives is tainted with mean notions of his attributes, and groundless fears of his power.\n\nBut besides these advantages which accrue to different classes of men from this study, there are some effects which are general, and are too important to be passed over unnoticed.\n\nThat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of dispassionate experimental enquiry in which has so greatly promoted this study, will carry therewith it, into every subject of enquiry, that precision, and that constant appeal to fact and experience which characterize it. And we may venture to assert, that the superior good order and method which distinguish some of the later productions in other sciences, have been in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> owing to this mathematical spirit, the success of which in natural philosophy has gained it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, and thus given it an unperceived influence even over those who have not made it their study.\n\nThe truths also which the naturalist discovers are more general, such as do not in general affect the passions of men, and have therefore a good chance of meeting with a candid reception. Those whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> it is to keep men in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> or religious ignorance, cannot easily suspect bad consequences from improvements in this science; and if they did, have hardly any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for checking its progress. And discoveries accustom the mind to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>; and it will no longer be startled by any consequences, however contrary to common opinion. Thus the way is paved for a rational and direct scepticism, and a free enquiry on other subjects. Experiment, not authority, will be considered as the test of truth; and under the guidance of fair experience we need fear no ill as long as the laws of nature remain as they are.\n\nLastly, since it is the business of philosophy to describe the phenomena of nature, to discover their causes, to trace the connection and subordination of these causes, and thus obtain a view of the whole constitution of nature; it is plain that it affords the surest path for arriving at the knowledge of the great cause of all, of God himself, and for forming proper conceptions of him and of our relations to him: notions infinitely more just than can ever be entertained by the careless spectator of his works.

All these intelligent beings give indications of knowledge and of power; but their knowledge bears, in general, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their power of producing changes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and of attaining important ends; and their power is neither always, nor in the most important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their knowledge. Where the effect of their actions is most eminently conducive to their important interests, the power of attaining these valuable ends is generally independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the fitness of the means, and the exertion is frequently made without even thinking of the important end. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-being of the individual is secured against any danger from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, indolence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> inattention, by an instinctive propensity, which leads it to the performance of the necessary action, which is thus made immediately and ultimately desirable, without any regard to its ultimate and important end. Thus, in our own nature, the support of animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and the improvement of the means of subsistence by a knowledge of the objects which surround us, are not entrusted to our apprehensions of the importance of these ends, but are committed to the surer guides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and curiosity.\n\nThe same observers discover a connection between the individuals of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, different from that which connection arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> resemblance of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearance, or even of their propensities and pursuits; the individuals of a very circumstances which produced the classification of animals. They observe, that these propensities are such, that while each individual seeks only its own enjoyment, the enjoyments are in general such as contribute to the support of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> and the enjoyment of other individuals. Thus, in the classes of animals, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature, the continuance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, and the enjoyment of the whole, are not entrusted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> we entertain of the importance of these ends, but are produced by the operation of sexual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and the love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\n\nThe same observers find that even the different classes of sentient beings are connected together; and while to a link of the whole of each class aim only at their own enjoyment, they contribute, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> or other, to the well-being of the other classes.

See his prefaces to the volumes for 1792 and 1793, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of this sublunary world, is not the unconnected inhabitant of it. He cannot, in every instance, reap all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his situation, without contributing to the enjoyment of thousands of the brute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. Nay, it may be proved to the satisfaction of every intelligent man, that while one race of animals, in consequence of its peculiar propensities, subsists by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of another, the sum total of animal life and enjoyment is prodigiously increased. See a very judicious dissertation on this curious and puzzling subject, entitled *A Philosophical Survey of the Animal Creation*; where it appears that the increase of animal life and enjoyment which is produced by this means, beyond what could possibly obtain without it, is beyond all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. See likewise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> edition of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Origin of Evil*, by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> late bishop of Carlisle.\n\nThus the whole assemblage seems connected, and jointly employed in increasing the sum total of possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. This fitness of the various propensities of sentient and intelligent beings, this subserviency to a general purpose, strikes these observers as a mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>, evidently distinct from, and independent of, all the particular intentions, and superior to them all; and thus it irresistibly leads them to infer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a supreme mind, directing the whole of this intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, while the individuals of which it consists appear the unconscious instruments in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, with which he executes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and beneficent purposes.\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> goes yet further. The bodies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> creation are not only connected with each other by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> dependence of properties, and the relation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a>, but they are also connected with the sentient beings by a subserviency to their purposes of enjoyment. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> observes that this connection is admirably kept up by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> operations and the expectations of intelligent beings. Had either of these circumstances been wanting, had either the operations of nature been without rule, or had sentient beings no perception or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of their uniformity; the subserviency would be totally at an end. This adjustment, this fitness, of which the effect is the enjoyment of the sentient inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, appear to be the effect of an intention of which this enjoyment is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause. This constancy therefore in the operations of nature, both in the intellectual and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> world, and the concomitant expectation of sentient beings, appear the effects of laws imposed on the different parts of the universe by the Supreme Mind, who has formed both these classes of beings so admirably suited to each other.\n\nTo such observers the world appears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of art, a system of means employed for gaining certain proposed ends, and it carries the thoughts forward to an artist; and we infer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of skill, power, and good intention in this artist, proportioned to the ingenuity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and happy effect which we are able to discern in his works. Such a contemplation of nature, therefore, terminates in natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, or the discovery of the existence and attributes of God.\n\nOur notions of this Supreme Mind are formed from the indications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> which we observe, and which we interpret in the same way as in the actions of men. These notions, therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> differ from our notions of other minds only in the degrees which we are able to observe, and which we assign to these faculties; for the phenomenon or the effect is not only the mark, but also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of its supposed cause. These degrees must be ascertained by our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of appreciating the extent, the multiplicity, and the variety of the contrivance. Accordingly, the attributes of the Supreme Mind, in the theological creed of a rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a>, are much more limited than in that of a European philosopher. In proportion as our understandings are enlarged, and as our acquaintance with the operations of nature around us is extended, we shall perceive higher degrees of power, of skill, and of kind intention: and since we find that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of observation is unbounded, we cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a> any boundaries to these attributes in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and we are ready to suppose that they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> or unbounded in their own nature. When our attentive survey of this universe, and a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of all its parts, as far as we can understand or appreciate them, have made us conclude that it is one design, the work of one artist; we are under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of inferring, that, with respect to this universe, his power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, are indeed infinite.\n\nWhen men have been led to draw this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> from the appearances of fitness which are observed everywhere of nature where around them, they consider that constancy which is governed by general laws, the intellective system, and that expectation of confidence in this constancy, which renders the universe a source of enjoyment to its sentient inhabitants, as the consequences of laws imposed by the Almighty Artist on his works, in the same manner as they would consider the constancy in the conduct of any people as the consequences of laws <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a> and enforced by the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>.\n\nThere can be no doubt of this view of nature being the nature extremely captivating, and likely to engage the curiosity and propensity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men; and it is not surprising that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the phenomena of mind have been keenly studied in all ages. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the study of nature, like all others, was first cultivated in subserviency to the wants of social life; and the general laws of moral sentiment were the first phenomena which were considered with attention. This gradually ripened into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> system of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, accompanied by its congenial study, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the summum bonum, or the constituents of human felicity; and these two branches of intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> were always kept in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> by the philosophers of antiquity. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">Jurisprudence</a>, the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, were also first cultivated as arts, or at least in immediate subserviency to the demands of cultivated society; and all these so nearly related parts of the study of human nature, had made a very considerable progress, in the form of maxims or precepts for directing the conduct, before speculative men, out of mere curiosity, treated them as subjects of philosophical study. Our moral sentiments, always involving a feeling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>, are expressed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> considerably different from the usual language of pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, speaking of things which ought to be, rather than of things which are; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of language was increased by the very aim of the writers,\nwhich was generally to influence the conduct as well as the opinions of their scholars. It was referred for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times to bring this study into the pure form of philosophy, by a careful attention to the phenomena of moral sentiment, and clasping these according to their generality, and ascertaining their respective ranks by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to experiment, that is, to the general conduct of mankind; and thus it happens that in the modern treatises on ethics, jurisprudence, &c., there is less frequent reference made to the officia or duties, or to the constituents of the summum bonum, than among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and a more accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the human mind, and discrimination of its various moral feelings.\n\nIt was hardly possible to proceed far in these disquisitions without attending to the powers of the understanding. Differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> were supported by reasonings, or attempts at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. Both sides could not be in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, and there must be some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of appeals. Rules of argumentation behoved to be acquiesced in by both parties; and it could hardly escape the notice of some curious minds, that there were rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and falsehood as well as of right and wrong. Thus the human understanding became an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of study, first in subserviency to the demands of the moralists, but afterwards for its own sake; and it gradually grew up into the science of logic. Still further refinement produced the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, or the philosophy of universals. But all these were in fact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to the doctrines of morals; and disquisitions on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, the precepts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> and criticism, were the last additions to the study of the phenomena of mind. And now, since the world seems to have acquiesced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of investigation of general laws by experiment and observation, and to agree that this is all the knowledge that we can acquire of any subject whatever, it is to be expected that this branch of philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> will attain the same degree of improvement (estimated by the coincidence of the doctrines with fact and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>) that has been attained by some others.\n\nThe occupations, however, of ordinary life have often directed our efforts towards material objects, and engaged our attention on their properties and relations; and as all sciences have arisen from arts, and were originally implied in the maxims and precepts of those arts, till separated from them by the curious speculatist, the knowledge of the material system of nature was polished in detached scraps by the practitioners in the various arts of life <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the natural philosopher thought of collecting them into a body of scientific doctrines. But there have not been wanting in all ages men of curiosity who have been struck by the uniformity of the operations of nature in the material world, and were eager to discover their causes.\n\nAccordingly, while the moralists and metaphysicians turned their whole attention to the phenomena of mind, and have produced the sciences of pneumatology, logic, ethics, jurisprudence, and natural theology, these observers of nature have found sufficient employment in considering the phenomena of the material world.","sp":26,"ep":28}]
