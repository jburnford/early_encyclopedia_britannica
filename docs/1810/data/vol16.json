[{"h":"BEFORE MAN HAD RECOURSE TO AGRICULTURE AS THE MOST CERTAIN","t":"e man had recourse to agriculture as the most certain means of procuring subsistence, our acquaintance with external substances was principally that of the natural historian; confining a knowledge of their fitness for food, medicine, or accommodation, their places of growth or habitation, and the means of procuring them, depending on their manner of life or existence. It required a studied attention to these circumstances to give agriculture its appearance after men had been in the practice of keeping flocks; by which means they were more at their leisure, and had some leisure to attend to the objects around them, and in particular to these circumstances of soil and weather which affected the growth of their pasture.\n\nWhen agriculture and rude medicine were thus established, they were the first arts which had their foundation in a system of laws, by which the operations of nature were observed to be regulated; and with these arts we may begin the general study of nature, which was thus divided into two different branches.\n\nThe rude physician would be at first a collector of specifics; but by degrees he would observe resemblances among the operations of his drugs, and would classify them according to these resemblances. He would thus come to attend less to the drug than to its mode of operation, and would naturally speculate concerning the connection between the operation and the economy of animal life. His art now becomes a scientific system, connected by principle and theory, all proceeding on the observation of changes produced by one kind of matter on another, but all out of sight. The frequent recourse to the vegetable kingdom for medicines would cause him to attend much more minutely to the few plants which he has occasion to study than the husbandman can do to the multitude he is obliged to rear. The physician must learn to think, the husbandman to work. An analogy between the economy of animal and vegetable life could hardly fail to engage the attention of the physician, and would make him a botanist, both as a classifier of plants and as a philosopher.\n\nHe would naturally expect to unite the services of his drugs by combining them in his recipes, and would be surprised at his disappointments. Curious and unexpected changes would frequently occur in his manipulations: the sensible qualities, and even the external appearances of his simples, would be often changed, and even inverted by their mixture; and their medicinal properties would frequently vanish from the compound, and new ones be induced. These are curious, and to him interesting facts; and he would naturally be inquisitive af-\nter the principles which regulate these changes. His skill in this would by degrees extend beyond the immediate use for the knowledge; and the more curious speculation would lay the foundations of a most extensive and important science, comprehending all the phenomena of heat and mixture.\n\nAlong with this, and springing from the same source, another science must arise, contemplating the appearances of animal and vegetable life, and founded on a careful observation and accurate description of the wonderful machine. The most inquisitive of men have in all ages been affected by the displays of wisdom and contrivance in the bodies of animals, and immediately engaged in investigation into the uses and functions of their various parts and organs. The phenomena have been gradually discriminated and arranged under the various heads of nutrition, conception, secretion, absorption, assimilation, rejection, growth, life, decay, disease, and death; and, in conformity to the doctrines which have with greater or less evidence been established on these subjects, the action of medicines, and the whole practice of physic and surgery, has been established in the form of a liberal or scientific art.\n\nThe husbandman in the mean time must labour the ground which lies before him. He, too, is greatly interested in the knowledge of the vegetable economy, and forms some systems on the subject by which he regulates his labours: but he feels, that whatever is the nature of vegetable life, he must work hard, and he searches about for every thing which can tend to diminish his labour. The properties of the lever, the wedge, and the inclined plane, soon become familiar to him; and without being able to tell on what their efficacy depends, he uses them with a certain sagacity and effect. The strength of timber, the pressure and force of water, are daily seen and employed by him and other artisans who labour for their mutual accommodation; and some rude principles on these subjects are committed to memory. Many tools and simple machines are by this time familiar; and thus the general properties of matter, and the general laws of the actions of bodies on each other, become gradually matter of observation and reflection; and the practical mechanic will be frequently improving his tools and machines. The general aim is to produce a greater quantity of work by the same exertion. The attempts to improvement will be awkward, and frequently unsuccessful. When a man finds, that by increasing the length of his lever he increases his power of overcoming a resistance, a small degree of curiosity is sufficient to make him inquire in what proportion his advantage increases. When he finds that a double length gives him a double energy, he will be surprised and mortified to find, that at the end of the day he has not performed twice the quantity of work: but, after much experience, he will learn that every increase of energy, by means of a machine, is nearly compensated by an increase of time in the performance of his task; and thus one of the great and leading principles of practical mechanics was inculcated in a manner not to be forgotten, and the practical mechanic was brought to speculate about motion and force, and by gradual and easy steps the general laws of simple motions were established.\n\nIt is evident that these speculations cannot be carried on, nor any considerable knowledge acquired, without some acquaintance with the art of measurement: and the very questions which the mechanic wishes to solve, presuppose some advances in this art, which in process of time refined itself into mathematics, the most perfect of all the sciences. All the phenomena of sensible motion afford employment to the mathematician. It is performed in a double or triple time, through a double or triple space, by a double or triple body, by the exertion of a double or triple force, produces a double or triple effect, is more to the right or to the left, upwards or downwards, &c. In short, every affection of motion is an object of mathematical discussion. Such a science must have appeared ere now in the form of an art, in consequence of the mutual transactions of men. These among an uncultivated people are chiefly in the way of barter. If I want corn from a peasant, and have nothing to give for it but the cloth which I have made, we must fall on some way of adjusting our terms in respect of the quantity. We should soon discover that the length, and breadth, and depth, of the box or bag, were equally important; and it was not difficult to see, that if any of them were doubled or tripled, the quantity of grain would be so too; if two of them were doubled, the grain would be quadrupled; and if all the three were doubled the quantity of grain would be increased eight times: the same thing would be observed with respect to my cloth. By such transactions as these, a few of the properties of plane and solid numbers and figures would become known, and the operations of multiplication and division, where arithmetic is combined with geometry; and daily observation shows us, that the more arbitrary properties of number and figure, which to the generality of mankind are so insignificant, lay hold on the fancy of some individuals with such force, as to abstract them from every other intellectual entertainment, and are studied with a keenness and perseverance almost unequalled in any other walk of science. To most men the performance of a machine is a more attractive object than the properties of a figure, and the property of a figure more entertaining than that of a number; but the fact seems to have been otherwise. Before Pythagoras had invented the theorem that bears his name (see Philosophy, No. 15, and note H), and which is among the first elements of geometry, he had reformed the Grecian music by the addition of a note to their scale, and this addition proceeds on a very refined speculation on the properties of numbers; so that among the Greeks arithmetic must have made considerable progress, while geometry was yet in its cradle: and we know to what astonishing length they prosecuted the science of pure geometry, while their knowledge of mechanical principles was almost nothing. Also the Arabs hardly made any addition to the geometry of the Greeks, if they did not rather almost completely forget it; whilst they improved their arithmetic into algebra, the most refined and abstracted branch of human knowledge. There is such a distance, in point of simplicity, between pure mathematics and the most elementary mechanics, that the former continued to make rapid steps to improvement in more modern times, while the latter languished in its infancy, and hardly deserved the name of science till very lately, when the great demand for it, by the increase and improvement in manufactures, both interested many in the study, and facilitated its progress, by the multitude of machines which were contriving on all hands by the manufacturers and artisans: and even at present it must\nbe acknowledged, that it is to them that we are indebted for almost every new invention in mechanics, and that the speculative field has done more than improve the invention, by exhibiting its principles, and thus enabling the artist to correct its imperfections; and now science and art go hand in hand, mutually giving and receiving affluence. The demands of the navigator for mathematical and astronomical knowledge have dignified these sciences; and they are no longer the means of elegant amusement alone, but merit the munificence of princes, who have erected observatories, and furnished voyages of discovery, where the mathematical sciences are at the same time cherished and applied to the most important purposes.\n\nThis short sketch of what may be called the natural history of physical sciences will not, we hope, be thought improper or unprofitable. It tends to confirm an assertion often alluded to, that the prosecution of the study of nature will be more successful, if we imitate her mode of proceeding, and divide the labour. It will be still further confirmed by attending to the scientific difference of the phenomena, which marks out a different mode of proceeding, and a difference in the knowledge which we shall ultimately acquire, after our most successful researches.\n\nIn both classes of phenomena already distinguished (No. 6.) we must grant, that the principle which connects the pairs of concomitant events, rendering the one the inseparable companion of the other, is totally unknown to us, because it is not the immediate object of our perception.\n\nBut in the phenomena of the first class, we see the immediate exertion of this principle, whatever it may be; we can observe the exertion with accuracy; we can determine its kind and degree, which are the signs and measures of the kind and degree of the unperceived cause. This exertion, being always some modification of motion, allows us to call in the aid of mathematical knowledge, and thus to ascertain with the precision peculiar to that science the energy of the cause, judging of the tendency and quantity by the tendency and the quantity of the observed effect.\n\nBut in the second class of phenomena the case is very different. In the operations of chemistry, for instance, the immediate exertion of the cause is not perceived: all that we observe is the affinage of particles which obtains before mixture, and that which takes place when it is completed, and which we consider as its result. The procedure of nature in producing the change is unseen and unknown. The steps are hid from our observation. We are not only ignorant of the cause which determines one particle of our food to become a part of our body while others are rejected, but we do not see the operation. We are not only ignorant of the cause which determines a particle of vitriolic acid to quit the fossil alkali with which it is united in Glauber salt, and to attach itself to a particle of magnesia already united with the muriatic acid, which also quits it to unite with the alkali, but we do not see the operation. The particles and their motions are not the objects of our senses; and all that we see is the Epsom salt and common salt separated from the water in which we had formerly dissolved the sal mirabile and the muriated magnesia. The motions, which are the immediate effects of the changing causes, and therefore their only indications, characteri-\n\nVol. XVI. Part II.\nthey have been such as, if allowed to act in a way analogous to what we observe in the sensible motions of bodies, would produce effects totally different from those which are observed. These atomic theories, as they are called, transgress every rule of philosophical discussion, and even the best of them are little better than trifling amusements. By far the greatest part of them only serve to raise a smile of pity and contempt in every person at all acquainted with mechanical philosophy. Whenever we see an author attempting to explain these hidden operations of nature by invisible fluids, by ethers, by collisions, and vibrations, and particularly if we see him introducing mathematical reasonings into such explanations\u2014the best thing we can do is to shut the book, and take to some other subject. That we may not be thought to speak presumptuously on this occasion, we only beg leave to remind our readers, that the united knowledge of the most eminent mathematicians of Europe has not yet been able to give anything more than an approximation to the solution of the problem of three bodies; that is, to determine with accuracy the motions of three particles of matter acting on each other in the simplest of all possible manners, viz. by forces varying as the squares of the distances inversely: and the vibrations of elastic bodies, of any but the very simplest possible forms, are to this day beyond the reach of investigation. What then should be our expectations in cases where millions of particles are acting at once, of forms unobserved, and with forces unknown, and where the object is not a determination of an average result of many, where the precise state of an individual particle need not be known, but where it is this very precise state of each single particle that we want to know? What can it be but uncertainty and mistake?\n\nNotwithstanding these discouraging circumstances, we must observe that this kind of inquiry has greatly improved of late years, along with the improvement and extension of mathematical philosophy, and since philosophers have given over their incipient attempts to explain every thing by impulse; and we need not despair of making still farther advances, if we will content ourselves with going no farther than Newton has done in his explanation of the planetary motions. He has immortalized his own name, and has added immensely to our stock of useful knowledge: yet he has stopped short at the discovery of the fact of universal gravitation; and all who have endeavoured to explain or account for this fact have only exposed themselves to pity. We may perhaps be one day able to demonstrate from the phenomena that the particles of matter have certain mutual tendencies to or from each other, exerted according to fixed or invariable rules; and from these tendencies we may be able to explain many other phenomena, and predict the consequences, with as much certainty and evidence as an astronomer calculates a future eclipse. This would be a great acquisition, and perhaps more is impossible: and the road to this has been hinted by Sir Isaac Newton, who has expressed his suspicion, that as the great movements of the solar system are regulated by universal gravitation, so the mutual actions of the particles of matter are produced and regulated by tendencies of a similar kind, equally but not more inexplicable, and of which the laws of action are to be discovered by as careful an attention to the phenomena, and by the same patient thinking, which he has employed on the planetary motions. And a beautiful introduction to this new and almost unbounded field of inquiry has been given us by the celebrated Abb\u00e9 Bofcovitch, in his Theory of Natural Philosophy, where he has shown how such mutual tendencies, similar in every ultimate particle of matter, and modified by conditions that are highly probable, nay almost demonstrable, will not only produce the sensible forms of solidity, hardness, elasticity, ductility, fluidity, and vapour, under an inconceivable variety of subordinate appearances, and the observed laws of sensible motion, but will go far to explain the phenomena of fusion, congelation, solution, crystallization, &c., &c., &c., both in chemistry and physiology. We earnestly recommend this work to the perusal of all who wish to obtain a distinct notion of the internal constitution of natural bodies, and of the way in which the uniting forces produce their ultimate and sensible effects. Any person, possessed of a moderate share of mathematical knowledge, will be convinced that the process of nature is not very different from what he describes; and that much of what we observe must happen as he says, even although the ultimate atoms of matter are not inextensible mathematical points, accompanied with attracting and repelling forces.\n\nBut we have many steps to make before we begin this Our ignorance study: Nature opens to us an immense volume; and we cannot doubt that our posterity will long find employment in the pursuit, even though advancing with the eager heads and heels of the last century. We have not yet arrived at the threshold in many parts of this research; and are uncertain with respect to the phenomena themselves, which are to be the subjects of this discussion. The composition of bodies must be fully understood before we begin to speak of the forces which unite their particles, or speculate about their modes of action. As long as water was considered as an element, we were ignorant of the forces inherent in its particles; we are perhaps still ignorant of this; but we now know that they are extremely different from what we formerly supposed them to be. It is but in a very few, if in any, cases of chemical combination, that we even know what are the ingredients: till we know this, it is too soon to speculate about their mode of union. Our ignorance in the real events in the animal and vegetable economy is still greater. Our first task therefore is to proceed, as we are now doing, in the accurate examination and classification of the phenomena themselves; and, without attempting to bring them within the pale of mathematical philosophy, by attempting what are called mechanical explanations, let us give up the consideration of these hidden operations, and augment to the utmost our list of secondary laws of visible but remote connections. All the mechanical speculations of the honourable Robert Boyle about the sensible qualities of things are now forgotten; but his chemical experiments preserve all their value, and are frequently referred to. The same may be said of the sagacious Dr Hales, whose fanciful notions of internal conflicts, and collisions, and vibrations, derogate nothing from the value of the curious facts which he has established both in the animal and vegetable economy.\n\nThis distinction in the nature of the phenomena, and this difference in the nature of the knowledge which is to be acquired, and the means which are to be employed in Britain.\nployed for the successful prosecution of these two branches of general physics, has occasioned a still farther restriction (at least in Britain) of the term NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It is particularly applied to the study of the phenomena of the first class, while those of the second have produced the sciences of CHEMISTRY and PHYSIOLOGY.\n\nNatural philosophy and chemistry have generally been made particular institutions in our seminaries of learning, but physiology has more commonly been taught in conjunction with anatomy, medicine, and botany.\n\nThe phenomena of the first class have been usually called MECHANICAL, in order to distinguish them from those observed in the operations of chemistry, and in the animal and vegetable economy; and the explanations which have been attempted of some of the last, by applying the laws observed in the phenomena of the first class, have been called mechanical explanations.\n\nAs this first class is evidently but a part of general physics, there is some impropriety in giving the name natural philosophy to a course of doctrines which is confined to these alone. Indeed at the first institution of universities, the lectures given in the Schola Physica were much more extensive, comprehending almost all the phenomena of the material world; but as all arts and sciences have improved most where the labour has been most divided, it was found more conducive to the advancement of knowledge that separate institutions should be founded for the studies of natural history, chemistry, physiology, &c.; and thus the phenomena purely mechanical, and a few others in magnetism, electricity, and optics, which either were susceptible of mathematical treatment, or had little connection with the studies of chemistry and physiology, were left to the care of the professor of natural philosophy.\n\nAs the terms chemistry and physiology have been applied to two very important branches of general physics, we think that a more specific or characteristic name might be appropriated to the other, and that it might very properly be termed MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nIt only remains to make a few observations on the distinctive means of prosecuting these studies with success, and to point out some of the advantages which may reasonably be expected from a careful prosecution of them: and as the second branch has been fully treated under the several articles of Chemistry, Physiology, &c., we shall confine ourselves to what is usually called NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nMechanical Philosophy may, in conformity with the foregoing observations, be defined, \"the study of the sensible motions of the bodies of the universe, and of their actions producing sensible motions, with the view to discover their causes, to explain subordinate phenomena, and to improve art.\"\n\nThe principle upon which all philosophical discussion proceeds is, that every change which we observe in the condition of things is considered by us as an effect, indicating the agency, characterising the kind, and measuring the degree, of its cause.\n\nIn the language of mechanical philosophy, the cause of any change of motion is called a moving or changing force.\n\nThe disquisitions of natural philosophy must therefore begin with the consideration of motion, carefully noticing every affection or quality of it, so as to establish marks and measures of every change of which it is susceptible; for these are the only marks and measures of the changing forces. This being done, it only remains to apply them to the motions which we observe in the universe.\n\nFrom the general principle of philosophical discussion already mentioned, there flow directly two axioms.\n\n1. Every body perseveres in a state of rest, or of uniform rectilineal motion, unless affected by some moving force.\n\n2. Every change of motion is in the direction and in the degree of the force impressed.\n\nThese are usually called the LAWS OF MOTION. They are more properly laws of human judgment, with respect to motion. Perhaps they are necessary truths, unless it be alleged that the general principle, of which they are necessary consequences, is itself a contingent though universal truth.\n\nBy these two axioms, applied in abstracto to every variety of motion, we establish a system of general doctrines concerning motions, according as they are simple or compound, accelerated, retarded, rectilineal, curvilinear, in single bodies, or in systems of connected bodies; and we obtain corresponding characteristics and measures of accelerating or retarding forces, centripetal or centrifugal, simple or compound.\n\nWe have an illustrious example of this abstract system of motion and moving forces in the first book of Sir Isaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Euler's Mechanica seu Scientia Motus, Herman's Phononima seu de Viribus Corporum, and D'Alembert's Trait\u00e9 de Dynamique, are also excellent works of the same kind. In this abstract system no regard is paid to the casual differences of moving forces, or the sources from which they arise. It is enough to characterise a double accelerating force, for instance, that it produces a double acceleration. It may be a weight, a stream of water, the pressure of a man; and the force, of which it is said to be double, may be the attraction of a magnet, a current of air, or the action of a spring.\n\nHaving established these general doctrines, the philosopher now applies them to the general phenomena of the universe, in order to discover the nature of the forces which really exist, and the laws by which their operations are regulated, and to explain interesting but subordinate phenomena. This is the chief business of the mechanical philosopher; and it may with some propriety be called the mechanical history of nature.\n\nSome method must be followed in this history of mechanical nature. The phenomena must be classified by arrangement of their resemblances, which infer a resemblance in their causes, and these classes must be arranged according to some principle. We have seen no method which appears to us less exceptionable than the following:\n\nThe principle of arrangement is the generality of the phenomena; and the propriety of adopting this principle, arises from the probability which it gives us of more readily discovering the most general actuating forces, whose agency is implicated in all other phenomena of arrangement.\nMechanical extent; and therefore should be previously discussed, that we may detect the discriminating circumstances which serve to characterize the subordinate phenomena, and are thus the marks of the distinguishing and inferior natural powers.\n\nThe most general of all phenomena is the curvilinear motion of bodies in free space; it is observed through first applied the whole extent of the solar system.\n\nThe mechanical history of nature begins therefore with astronomy. Here, from the general phenomena of the planetary motions, is evinced the fact of the mutual deflection of every body towards every other body, and this in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distance, and the direct proportion of the quantity of matter. This is the fact of universal gravitation, indicating the agency, and measuring the intensity, of the universal force of mutual gravity.\n\nHaving established this as an universal fact, the natural philosopher proceeds to point out all the particular facts which are comprehended under it, and whose peculiarities characterize the different movements of the solar system. That is, in the language of philosophy, he gives a theory or explanation of the subordinate phenomena; the elliptical motions of the planets and comets, their mutual disturbances; the lunar irregularities; the oblate figure of the planets; the nutation of the earth's axis; the precession of the equinoxes; and the phenomena of the tides and trade winds; and he concludes with the theory of the parabolic motion of bodies projected on the surface of this globe, and the motion of pendulums.\n\nAs he goes along, he takes notice of the applications which may be made to the arts of life of the various doctrines which are successively established; such as chronology, astronomical calculation, dialling, navigation, gunnery, and the measuring of time.\n\nIf a square parcel of land be lying on the table, and the finger be applied to any part of it to push it along the table, that part is removed where you will, but the rest remains in its place; but if it is a piece of sandstone of the same materials and shape, and the finger is applied as before, the whole is moved; the other parts accompany the part impelled by the finger in all its motions.\n\nFrom the moon's accompanying the earth in all its motions round the sun, we infer a moving force which connects the moon and earth. In like manner, we must conclude that a moving force connects the particles of the stone; for we give the name force to every thing which produces motion: We call it the force of cohesion; a term which, like gravitation, expresses merely a fact.\n\nThis seems to be the next phenomenon of the universe in point of extent.\n\nHaving, from the general phenomenon, established the existence of this force, the philosopher proceeds to ascertain the laws by which its exertions are regulated; which is the ascertaining its distinctive nature and properties. This he does in the same way that he ascertained the nature of planetary gravitation, viz. by observing more particularly the various phenomena.\n\nHere is opened a most extensive and varied field of observation, in which it must be acknowledged that very little regular and marked progress has been made. The variety in the phenomena, and the consequent variety in the nature of the connecting forces, appear as yet inconceivably great; and there seems little probability of our being able to detect in them all any familiars, combined with the other distinguishing circumstances, as we have done in the case of gravity. Yet we should not despair. Bolzovich has shown, in the most unexceptionable manner, that although we shall suppose that every atom of matter is endowed with a perfectly similar force, acting in a certain determined ratio of the small and imperceptible distances at which the particles of matter are arranged with respect to each other, the external or sensible appearances may, and must, have all that variety which we observe. He also shows very distinctly how, from the operation of this force, must arise some of the most general and important phenomena which characterize the different forms of tangible bodies.\n\nWe observe the chief varieties of the action of this corpuscular force on the bodies which we denominate hard, soft, solid, fluid, vaporous, brittle, ductile, elastic. We see instances where the parts of bodies avoid each other, and require external force to keep them together, or at certain small distances from each other. This is familiar in air, vapours, and all compressible and elastic bodies.\n\nThis is evidently a most curious and interesting subject of investigation. On the nature and action of these corpuscular forces depends the strength or firmness of solids, their elasticity, their power of communicating motion, the pressure, and motion, and impulse of fluids; nay, on the same actions depend all the chemical and physiological phenomena of expansion, fusion, congelation, vaporization, condensation, solution, precipitation, absorption, secretion, fermentation, and animal and vegetable conception and assimilation.\n\nOut of this immense store of phenomena, this inexhaustible fund of employment for our powers of investigation, the natural philosopher selects those which lead directly to the production or modification of sensible motion.\n\nHe will therefore consider,\n\n1. The communication of motion among detached and free bodies, establishing the laws of impulse or collision. This has always been considered as the elementary doctrine of mechanical philosophy, and as the most familiar been fact observed in the material world; and in all ages thought the philosophers have been anxious to reduce all actions of most familiar bodies on each other to impulse, and have never thought it a fact till it has been shown to be a case of impulse. This it is which has given rise to the hypotheses of vortices, ethers, magnetic and electric fluids, animal spirits, and a multitude of fancied intermediaries between the sensible masses of matter, which are said in common language to act on each other. A heavy body is supposed to fall, because it is impelled by a stream of an invisible fluid moving according to certain conditions suited to the case. The filings of iron are supposed to be arranged round a magnet, by means of a stream of magnetic fluid issuing from one pole, circulating perpetually round the magnet, and entering at the other pole, in the same manner as we observe the flore-grafs arranged by the current of a brook.\n\nBut the philosopher who has begun the mechanical study of nature by the abstract doctrines of dynamics, opinion is and made its first application to the celestial phenomena, and who has attended carefully to the many analogies.\nMechanical logics between the phenomena of gravitation and cohesion, will be at least ready to entertain very different notions of this matter. He will be so far from thinking that the production of motion by impulse is the most familiar fact in nature, that he will acknowledge it to be comparatively very rare; nay, there are some appearances in the facts, which are usually considered as instances of impulsion, which will lead him to doubt, and almost to deny, that there has ever been observed an instance of one body putting another in motion by coming into absolute contact with it, and striking it; and he will be disposed to think that the production of motion in this case is precisely similar to what we observe when we gently push one floating magnet towards another, with their similar poles facing each other. There will be the same production of motion in the one and diminution of it in the other, and the same uniform motion of the common centre of gravity: and, in this case of the magnets, he feels completely the necessity of a law of motion, which is not an axiom, but is observed through the whole of nature, and which receives no explanation from any hypothesis of an intervening fluid, but is even totally inconsistent with them. We mean, \"that every action of one body on another is accompanied by an equal and opposite action of that other on the first.\" This is usually called the equality of action and reaction: it is not intuitive, but it is universal; and it is a necessary consequence of the perfect similarity of the corporeal forces of the same kinds of matter. This general fact, unaccountable on the hypothesis of impelling fluids, is considered in the planetary motions as the unequivocal indication of the sameness of that gravity which regulates them all. The rules of good reasoning should make us draw the same conclusion here, that the particles of tangible matter are connected by equal and mutual forces, which are the immediate causes of all their sensible actions, and that these forces, like gravitation, vary with every change of distance and situation.\n\nThe laws of collision and impulsion being now established, either as original facts or as consequences of the agency of equal and mutual forces which connect the particles of matter, the philosopher considers,\n\n2. The production of motion by the intervention of solid bodies, where, by reason of the cohesion of matter, some of the motions are necessarily confined to certain determinate paths or directions. This is the case in all motions round fixed points or axes, or along planes or curves which are oblique to the action of the forces.\n\nThis part of the study contains the theory of machines, pointing out the principles on which their energy depends, and consequently furnishing maxims for their construction and improvement. But these observations do not complete the discussion of the mechanism of solid bodies: they are not only solid and inert, but they are also heavy; therefore the action of gravity must be combined with the consequences of solidity. This will lead to discussions about the centre of gravity, the theory and construction of arches and roofs, the principles of stability and equilibrium, the attitudes of animals, and many particulars of this kind.\n\n3. The philosopher will now turn his attention to another form, in which tangible matter exhibits many interesting phenomena, viz. FLUIDITY. The first thing to be attended to here is, What is that particular form of existence? What is the precise phenomenon which characterizes fluidity? What is the definition of a fluid?","sp":29,"ep":35},{"h":"BUT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE AIR IS BY NO","t":"t the mere presence of the air is by no means sufficient for preserving the life of the animal; for it is found, that an animal shut up in a vessel of air cannot live in it for any length of time. If a man be shut up in a box, containing a wine hogshead of air, he cannot live in it much above an hour, and long before this he will find his breathing very unsatisfactory and uneasy. Effects of vacuo.\n\nA gallon of air will support him about a minute. A box EF (fig. 75.) may be made, having a pipe AB inserted into its top, and fitted with a very light valve at Fig. 75. B, opening upwards. This pipe feeds off a lateral branch D C, which enters the box at the bottom, and is also fitted with a light valve at C opening upwards. If a person breathe through the pipe, keeping his nostrils shut, it is evident that the air which he expires will not enter the box by the hole B, nor return through the pipe CD; and by this contrivance he will gradually employ the whole air of the box. With this apparatus experiments can be made without any risk or inconvenience, and the quantity of air necessary for a given time of easy breathing may be accurately ascertained.\n\nHow the air of our atmosphere produces this effect, is a question which does not belong to mechanical philosophy to investigate or determine. We can, however, affirm, that it is neither the pressure nor the elasticity of the air which is immediately concerned in maintaining the animal functions. We know that we can live and breathe with perfect freedom on the tops of the highest mountains. The valley of Quito in Peru, and the country round Gondar in Abyssinia, are so far elevated above the surface of the ocean, that the pressure and the elasticity of the air are one-third less than in the low countries; yet these are populous and healthy places. And, on the other hand, we know, that when an animal has breathed in any quantity of air for a certain time without renewal, it will not only be suffocated, but another animal put into this air will die immediately; and we do not find either the pressure or elasticity of the air remarkably diminished: it is indeed diminished, but by a very small quantity. Referring the former pressure and elasticity has not the smallest tendency to prevent the death of the animal; for an animal will live no longer under a receiver that has its mouth inverted on water, than in one set upon the pump-plate covered with leather. Now when the receiver is set on water, the pressure of the atmosphere acts completely on the included air, and preserves it in the same state of elasticity.\n\nIn short, it is known that the air which has already served to maintain the animal functions has its chemical or air and alimentary properties completely changed, and is no longer fit for this purpose. So much of any mass of air animal as has really been thus employed is changed into what functions is called fixed air by Dr Black, or carbonic acid by the quite alter-chemists of the Lavoisierian school. Any person may be convinced of this by breathing or blowing through a pipe immersed in lime water.

On examining the writings of the earliest philosophers, we meet with little more than a collection of abstract principles and hypothetical reasonings, especially previous to Pythagoras. He considered man as a microcosm, or an epitome of the universe, in which were produced the same phenomena as in the larger world, only to a less extent. He admitted more than one intelligent principle, conducing all the operations of the human body. He supposed that the human soul nourished by the blood, fixed by the veins, the arteries, and the nerves, as so many visible situations, became obedient to the general laws of universal harmony. He did not pretend that the eternal power of numbers had prefabricated all the phenomena of nature, and that the force of numerical harmonies regulated the motions of the bodies which filled the universe, though he has been made so to express himself by his disciples. He was contented with asserting, that every thing in nature was brought about according to the qualities and proportions of numbers, without attributing to them an intrinsic virtue and a positive existence. He perceived that the phenomena of the animal economy succeeded each other with a strict regularity, by which they concurred in maintaining order; and in this order he found the principle of the existence and preservation of all beings; a principle without which they could not exist. He considered the souls of men as emanations from the general soul of the universe, or anima mundi.\n\nAlcmaeon considered the brain as the seat of the soul. He supposed found to be produced by the reverberation of the air within the cavity of the ear; and he thought that taste was owing to the moisture of the tongue. He compared the body of a fetus to a sponge, which obtained its nourishment by the suction established over every part of its substance. According to him, the motion of the blood was the essential principle of life; and he supposed that the stagnation of this fluid in the veins produced sleep, and its active expansion brought back the waking state of the body. Health consisted in the equilibrium and well proportioned mixture of certain primary qualities; and that whenever any of these became too predominant, disease was the consequence.\n\nEmpedocles involved himself in a multitude of absurd hypotheses, in order to explain the formation of man, and the combination of the elements from which he was produced. He too, like the disciples of Pythagoras, sought among the properties of numbers, for the general principles both of physical and moral science. In uniformity with this system it was, that he reckoned the four elements, and admitted among the particles of these material principles a kind of affection and aversion, of desire and antipathy, capable of separating and reuniting them, as occasion might require. He believed that respiration commenced within the uterus, where the infant was provided from each parent with certain organic particles, which tended to unite into one uniform whole. Anaxagoras, convinced that we must attribute the arrangement of matter to the intelligence of a superintending being, imagined that the body of every animal was formed of homogeneous particles, which were brought together by a sort of affinity. It appeared to him, that bodies which were endowed with thought, were composed of sensible elements; that these elements remained unalterable, and that no power in nature could exert any action on them.\n\nDemocritus dedicated his life to repeated experiments on plants and animals. He explained the principal phenomena of organized bodies by the action and reaction of atoms, which he supposed to be endowed with powers essentially active, and susceptible of repelling and attracting each other. According to him, generation consisted in the cohesion of homogeneous atoms. He conceived the heat inherent in the elements of the body to be the sole active principle with which man was animated; and that by increase of this he became capable of life and motion. He compared the organs of the senses to mirrors, on which were painted the images of things, and he reduced all sensations to the sense of feeling, which he supposed to be more or less delicate according to circumstances.\n\nThese philosophers, who lived before the time of Hippocrates, had, as we see, but very rude and indistinct notions of the animal economy; nor were those of the great father of physic much superior. Excellent as was his practice, and acute his knowledge of the symptoms and progress of diseases, the physiology of Hippocrates was very lame and defective. He seems, indeed, to have understood the function of nutrition better than most others; he traces the aliment into the stomach, seems aware of the processes it has to undergo there, and hazards a conjecture that part of the chyle is taken up immediately by the pores of the cellular texture; and that the juices admitted into this membrane, served for the production of milk, the matter of which is afterwards transported, and laid up within the breasts. He attributes to each vital part an attractive force, which it exerts on the nutritious particles, in order to incorporate and appropriate to itself those which bear to it a certain analogy. He thought that the heat generated in a living body was kept up entirely by the powers of vitality; and that the external air introduced by respiration, served rather to check it, by exerting a cooling effect on the pulmonary organs. He represents the human body as agitated in all its parts by an alternate flux and reflux, which carried the matters from within outwards, or brought them from without inwards. From this some have supposed that he understood the circulation of the blood, a supposition made two hundred years ago, and lately again brought forward by the French physiologists. We shall not at present lay to canvass this opinion, which, however, we conceive to be founded on very unsatisfactory arguments.\n\nAfter Hippocrates, the science of man was again left Plato to the schools of philosophy, from which he had first separated it. Plato is the first philosopher whose opinions merit particular notice. He wrote on the physiology of man, with his accustomed elegance and splendor of diction; and he assumed the tone of an inspired prophet in describing, with the force of enthusiasm, the grand images that suggested themselves to his mind. Accord-\nAccording to him, the human body does not contain within itself the cause of the phenomena which are the consequence or the attendants of life. It is only a passive subject, on which the soul expresses the series of its functions, like the canvas on which the painter traces the conceptions of his invention. He distinguishes two principles of action in man, a rational soul, on which depend reflection and intelligence, and an irrational soul, on which depend life and motion. The latter is diffused through every part of the body; and it is by means of these parts that it feels, suffers pain, or enjoys pleasure. Thus it is by means of the heart it is susceptible of courage and of passion; by the liver of desire. The head is the seat of reason; the chest, and especially the heart, the seat of strength and anger; the lungs, the general coolers of the body. One division of the irrational soul, which possesses an appetite for food, and all the necessary refreshments of the body, resides in the epigastric region; which, in the language of Plato, is a sort of stable, in which resides a voracious animal. During nutrition, the vital parts assimilate to their substance the aliment which are presented to them; and this assimilation is the consequence of an affinity that takes place between these parts and the nutritious juices. He thus seems to regard nutrition as the effect of a combat between the aliments and the parts of the animal. A young animal will receive more nourishment than one which is old, because the force of its body has more effect in overcoming the force of the nutritious substances.\n\nAs the reciprocal action of the soul and the body on each other did not appear to him capable of being explained on the supposition of immateriality, he proposed the idea of a plastic nature, which he supposed to be an intermediate principle connecting the soul and the body.\n\nThe human body, which is entirely spongy, is exposed through every part to opposite currents of air and fire, which traverse and penetrate it, being introduced alternately by the lungs and by the skin. Hot, cold, dense, rare, and the other sensible properties of bodies, are only the causes of the phenomena which we perceive, and are, as it were, the occasions or accidents that are required to keep in play the intelligent force disseminated through nature.\n\nAristotle, the disciple of Plato, for a long time disputed with him the palm of genius and celebrity; but, as his physiological doctrines differed very little from those of his master, it is unnecessary to detail them, except to remark, that he attributed to the soul three faculties, a nutritive, a sensitive, and a rational faculty; in the first of which life is the only principle; in the second, feeling is produced; and the third is peculiar to man, and is that part of him which knows or judges. This part is either an active or a passive intellect, of which the first may be separated from the body, and is immortal; whereas the second perishes together with the body. Life, according to this philosopher, is a permanence of the soul, retained by the natural heat, the principle of which resides in the heart.\n\nAbout the period which we are now considering, philosophy was divided into two feuds; the materialists, who attributed the formation of all beings to the fortuitous concourse of atoms; and the spiritualists, who held that the soul enjoyed an existence anterior to that of the body, which was no other than a passive organ, in which the phenomena that previously existed in the soul, in an abstract, latent manner, became evident and sensible. To the former feet belonged Democritus and Epicurus; to the latter, Zeno and Plato.\n\nThe professors of the Alexandrian school, though they did much for the improvement of anatomy, added little to physiology. Of these Herophilus brought to some degree of perfection the doctrine of the pulse, and seems to have understood the action of the pulmonary organs more correctly than his predecessors, attributing to them a sort of natural appetite, by which they attracted and rejected the matter of respiration. He considered the nerves, the muscles, and the arteries, as the moving powers of the body.\n\nIn Galen, also a disciple of this school, we find the most scientific physiologist that has yet come under our notice. He seems first to have ascertained by experiment, that the arteries contain blood, and not air, as had been the opinion of Herophilus and his predecessors; and that they possessed a moving force, independent of that which the heart exercises on the mass of blood, and he found that the contraction of the heart always alternated with a proportional dilatation. He even tried some delicate experiments, in order to ascertain the influence of the nervous system upon the sensitive and motive powers of the body, by which he found, that when a nerve was intercepted with a ligature, the part to which it led became deprived of sense and motion. He believed that the stomach, in a state of contraction, applied itself to the aliment that had been taken in; that the mesenteric veins absorbed a portion of the chyle prepared in the intestines; that the ductus choledochus carried the bile from the gall bladder into the duodenum; that the kidneys separated a part of the urine; and he supposed, that another part of this fluid palled immediately from the stomach to the bladder, through some unknown passage. He believed that the lungs transmitted to the blood contained within them, an aerial principle, destined to free them from fuliginous vapours, and to temper the excesses of heat generated within the body. The obscure function of generation did not entirely escape his researches; and he made some curious attempts to find out how the sexual organs prepared the seminal fluid, and how this acted in reproduction.\n\nFor more respecting the doctrines of Galen, see the History of Medicine.\n\nThe commencement of the 13th century is the epoch of a material revolution in physiology. Chemistry having penetrated into Europe, soon exerted its influence on most of the sciences, and especially on those connected with medicine, the doctrines of which were totally changed from their ancient simplicity, and became a farce of the most wild and fanciful opinions. The Peripatetics and the Galenists sunk into oblivion; and the primitive qualities and occult faculties of the ancient school gave way to the fermentations and effervescences of the chemists. Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, when they introduced the science of chemistry, scarcely dreamed of applying it to medicine; but Arnoldus de Villa Nova undertook this application, and fought for the foundation of medical theory amid the processes of his laboratory. Paracelsus followed, and surpassed him in this chemical delirium. An enlightened chemist and a credulous\ncredulous astrologer, his head burning with the fire of his furnaces, and his imagination filled with magical reveries, he believed himself capable of constructing a new system of philosophy, from examining the course of the stars, and the products of his alembics. With the daring assurance of inspiration, he declared man to be composed of sulphur, mercury, and salt; and, having traced the origin of all diseases to certain chemical operations, he flattered himself, that by means of his arcanum he could preserve health, and prolong, to an indefinite extent, the natural duration of human existence.\n\nVan Helmont, the disciple of Paracelsus, not less fanciful, but more scientific than his master, saw the necessity of something more than chemical principles to explain the functions of the animal machine. He therefore introduced his arch\u00e6us, an intelligent being, who established his throne in the epigastric region, having several subaltern ministers under him, who presided over the several functions of the body, and whose chief seats were, the head, the chest, and the belly.\n\nDes Cartes. In the philosophy of Des Cartes, the separate existence of the vital principle is entirely rejected. He availed himself of the progress that had been made by Willis, and some other anatomists, in the investigation of the nervous system, to form an hypothesis of the vital functions, founded on the supposition of the nervous fluid, or what was then called the animal spirits; and this nervous fluid was assumed independently of the sensitive soul, to explain the appearances of sensation and voluntary motion.\n\nThe discovery of the valves in the veins by Fabricius; of the lymphatics by Rudbeck and Bartholin; of the lacteals by Aellius, and of the circulation of the blood by Harvey, all of which took place during the 17th century, gave to physiology an interest and a clearness which it never possessed before that period. Some account of the discoveries in the circulating and absorbing systems, hath been already given under Anatomy; but as these discoveries have been productive of great advantages, both in general physiology, and in medicine, it will be worth while briefly to trace their origin and progress.\n\nTo begin with the circulation of the blood, Hippocrates speaks of the usual and constant motion of the blood, of the veins and arteries as the fountains of human nature, as the rivers that water the whole body, and which if they be dried up, man dies. He says, that the blood-vessels are, for this reason, everywhere dispersed through the whole body; that they give spirits, moisture, and motion; that they all spring from one; and that this one has no beginning and no end, for where there is a circle there is no beginning. In such language was the prince of physicians accustomed to express his vague ideas of a circulation; for so far was he from having acquired accurate conceptions on this subject, that when he saw the motions of the heart, he believed that the auricles were two bellows to draw in air, and to ventilate the blood.\n\nWhen after his time anatomy came to be more studied, the notions of the ancients respecting the blood were better defined; and, however chimerical they may seem to us, they were partly derived from dissection and experiment. On opening dead bodies, they found that the arteries were almost empty, and that very nearly the whole of the blood was collected in the veins, and in the right auricle and ventricle of the heart. They therefore concluded that the right ventricle was a sort of laboratory; that it attracted the blood from the cavities; by some operation rendered it fit for the purpose of nutrition, and then returned it by the way that it came. From the almost empty state of the arteries, they were led to suppose that the right ventricle prepared air, and that this air was conveyed by the arteries to temper the heat of the several parts to which the branches of the veins were distributed.\n\nTo this last notion, entertained by Eraclitatus, Galen added an important discovery. By certain experiments, he proved, that the arteries contained blood as well as the veins. But this discovery was the occasion of some embarrassment. How was the blood to get from the right to the left ventricle? To solve the difficulty in which his new discovery had involved him, he supposed that the branches of the veins and arteries anastomosed; that when the blood was carried to the lungs by the pulmonary vein, it was partly prevented by the valves from returning; that therefore during the contraction of the thorax it passed through the small connecting branches to the pulmonary vein, and was thence conveyed along with the air to the left ventricle to flow in the aorta. This opinion, so agreeable to fact, unfortunately afterwards gave place to another that was the result of mere speculation. This notion was, that the left ventricle received air by the pulmonary vein; and that all its blood was derived through pores in the septum of the heart.\n\nThe passage through the septum being once suggested, and happening to be more easily conceived than one through the lungs, it was generally supposed the only one for a number of centuries; and supported likewise, as it was thought, by Galen's authority, it was deemed blasphemy in the schools of medicine to talk of another. In 1543, however, Vesalius having published his immortal work upon the structure of the human body, and given his reasons in the sixth book why he ventured to dissent from Galen, he particularly shewed how it was impossible that the blood could pass through the septum of the heart. His reasoning routed the attention of anatomists; and every one grew eager to discover the real passage which the blood must take in going from the right to the left ventricle. The discovery of this was first made by Michael Servetus, a Spanish physician, who published his opinion in 1553. He expressly says, that the blood does not pass through the septum of the heart, as is commonly believed, but is conveyed by an admirable contrivance from the right ventricle of the heart, by a long passage through the lungs. This opinion was deemed heretic, and Servetus's book was suppressed by public authority. Soon after, however, the same discovery was made by Realdo Columbus, an Italian professor, who published his account in 1559. It farther appears, that Andreas C\u0153lafloinis, who published in 1571, and again in 1593, was acquainted, not only with the lesser circulation, but observed, that the blood sometimes flowed from the branches of the veins towards their trunks; and that when a vein was tied with a ligature, it swelled between the ligature and the distal extremity of the vein, and not between the ligature and the heart. He thence inferred, that the veins and arteries opened into each other, and ventured to af-\nfert that the blood could not return by the arteries to the left ventricle of the heart. He did not, however, discover the true circulation, but most unaccountably maintained with Aristotle, of whom he was a zealous disciple, that the blood flowed like the tides of Euripus, backward and forward in the same channel, and supposed that it flowed from the arteries into the veins during sleep, and back again from the veins into the arteries till the waking state.\n\nIn 1574, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente, while he was seeking for a cause by which to explain the various swellings of some veins, which had arisen from friction and ligature, he, to his great joy and astonishment, discovered their valves in one of his dissections; and here again the true theory of circulation seemed almost unavoidable. Yet whoever reads the small treatise De Venarum Ostioli, first printed by Fabricius in 1603, will soon perceive that he was as far from entertaining a just notion of the circulation as his predecessors. Notwithstanding all that he saw, he still was of opinion that the blood flowed from the heart to the extremities even in the veins. He thought that the valves were intended by nature only to check and moderate its force. He calls them an instance of admirable wisdom, and mistakes his own awkward conjecture for one of the designs of infinite intelligence. In another respect, it must be confessed that he bore no inconsiderable share in promoting the discovery of the circulation. By writing on the valves, the formation of the fetus, and chick in ovo, he directed the attention of his pupil Harvey to those subjects where it was likely that the motion of the blood would frequently occur.\n\nHarvey, who was born in 1578, and graduated at Padua in 1602, examined the valves with more accuracy than Fabricius, and explained their use in a treatise which he published soon after his graduation. In 1616, he taught the true doctrine of the circulation in his lectures, and published on the subject in 1628. He was the first author who spoke confidently of the motion of the blood, and who, unbiassed by the doctrine of the ancients, drew rational conclusions from his experiments and observations. His books present us with many indications of a great mind, acute discernment, unwearyed application, original remark, bold inquiry, and a clear, forcible, and manly reasoning; and every one who considers the surmise which his doctrine occasioned among the anatomists of those days, the strong opposition that it met with from some, and the numerous and powerful prejudices which it had to encounter from the sanction of time and of great names, must allow it was new; and that the author has from its importance, a title to rank in the first class of eminent discoverers, ancient or modern.\n\nWe have been the more particular in tracing the progressive discovery of the circulation, and in attempting to show that the real merit of the discovery is due to Harvey, because both the abilities and the originality of this eminent man have been called in question by his countryman Dr William Hunter; and many hints are given in the writings of some foreign physiologists, that the circulation was at least guessed at by Hippocrates and other ancient writers.\n\nWe shall be less minute in tracing the discovery of the lymphatic system, because this has been related more at large in the article ANATOMY.\n\nWe learn from Galen, that certain vessels had been seen in kids by Eraclitratius, which appear to have been lacteals, though he called them arteries. These lacteals were, however, first accurately distinguished in 1622, of the discovery by Afellius, who printed his account in 1627. In 1651, Pecquet published his account of the thoracic duct, which appears, however, to have been seen before by Eustachius. In 1653, Bartholin published on the lymphatics, which had been some time before discovered by Rudbeck. In 1654, Glisson ascribed to these vessels the office of carrying back the lubricating lymph from the arteries into the blood, or considered them as absorbents. In 1664, the valves of these vessels were discovered by Swammerdam, and a year after, an account of them was given by Kuylich. The farther discoveries of Nuck, Nouges, Warton, Steno, Hunter, Monro, Hewson, Cruikshank, Sheldon, Macagni, &c., have nearly completed our knowledge of the absorbent system, and its uses.\n\nIn the latter end of the 17th century, some important discoveries were made on the subject of respiration, by our countryman Mayow; and these were supported by the observations of Lower, Verheyen, and Borelli. These discoveries, however, lay dormant till they were brought into recollection a hundred years after in consequence of the experiments of Priestley and Lavoisier.\n\nDuring the 17th century, considerable progress was made in completing the knowledge of the internal organs of generation. Much was done in this way by De Graaff and Malpighi, and Leuvenhoek, the two latter of whom made several discoveries with the assistance of their microscopes, though Leuvenhoek founded on his observations a theory of generation which at this day appears not a little ridiculous.\n\nThe beginning of the 18th century is remarkable for the promulgation of a new physiological doctrine, founded on a mistaken application of the circulation of the blood. We allude to the system of Boerhaave. This great physician supposed that all the functions of the living body, excepting the will, are carried on by mechanical movements, susceptible of rigid calculation, which necessarily succeed each other in the organs, from the time that life commences. These movements are brought into action as soon as the animal begins to respire, and are the consequence of an impulsive power in the heart, renewed by means of the influence of the nervous fluid brought from the brain. He conceived the living body to be merely a hydraulic machine, in which the heart performs the office of a piston, and that the alternate contractions and dilatations that take place without intermission in that organ, are owing to the alternately increased and diminished compression of the nerves that are distributed to the heart. When a contraction takes place, the blood fills the large arteries, and thus distends and compresses them; when the principal nerves of the heart, which pass between these arteries, must of course become compressed, and thus their influence being diminished, a relaxation takes place. But in proportion as the heart is relaxed, the large arteries become empty, and consequently cease to compress the nerves, which thus recovering their influence, reanimate the heart to a new contraction. Thus succeed each other without interruption the movements which form the mechanical principle of all the sensible motions that we observe in the animal machine.\nProceeding on these principles, Boerhaave conceived some very strange notions reflecting the constituent properties of the living fluids, in which he saw no other mark of vitality than the globular form of their particles. He confined all the functions of the several organs to the operations of rounding into spheres the particles of the fluids which were presented to them, or of preserving that form in those which they already contained. He thought that the lungs were chiefly of advantage, because they contained within them a complete series of vessels, in which the particles of the blood can receive all those dimensions which may fit them to circulate through the rest of the body. The greater or less velocity with which the fluids circulate through the secretory organs, constitutes the principal difference in the nature of the secretions. Various orders of vessels receive the blood and other fluids which pass through these divisions, subject to the laws of hydraulics; and when a fluid got by chance into an order of vessels that was not fitted to receive it, some disease was the consequence. Everything in the animal machine was reduced to an arrangement of conduits, canals, cords, levers, pulleys, and other mechanical contrivances, put into action by mechanical means.\n\nThus was completed the system of mechanical physiology, which was begun some time before by Bellini and Borelli; and this system maintained its ground in defiance of observation and common sense, till about the middle of the 18th century. In the mean time, however, there arose two men, whose enlarged ideas and acute genius induced them to differ from the received opinions of the day, and to think for themselves. These were Hoffman and Stahl, who, though they did not, any more than Boerhaave, form complete or unobjectionable theories, contributed much to improve our ideas of the animal economy.\n\nHoffman saw, that in the living body we ought not to separate the principle of vitality from the general properties of matter. He believed that that principle, susceptible in itself of activity and motion, was sufficient for all the occasions and all the functions of the body which it animated. The animal body was not, in his eyes, an hydraulic elastic machine, formed of solids and canals, differing only in size, form, elasticity and force. He saw, that if the solids act upon the fluids, they must, in their turn, react upon the solids; and that life could subsist only by these mutual actions and reactions. The essential cause of life, according to Hoffman, is the progressive motion of the blood, occasioned by the impulse of the heart, and kept up by the alternate contractions and dilatations of the vessels. These contractions and dilatations are the consequence of the force of an elasticity inherent in the vascular fibres, and this force is still farther promoted by the different structure of these elastic fibres, which is such that they can be penetrated by the blood and the nervous fluid. This last fluid he imagined to be composed of aerial and ethereal particles enveloped in a certain portion of a very pure subtile lymph, that served them as a vehicle. By this fluid the cavities of the nerves are filled, and it constitutes the sentient soul, in which resides the seat of the passions. Now, all the functions, even those which we attribute to a sentient principle, are the effect of physical powers, whose mechanism has, however, something more sublime and more exalted with respect to the animal operations than to others.\n\nIf all the nervous, vascular, and membranous parts, preserve a moderate degree of action, and a moderate state of tension and relaxation, the solids are subjected to oscillatory motions which balance each other, and produce a proper equilibrium in the system. In this state, all the operations of the body and the mind take place with proper regularity; and this happy harmony, by afflicting to the animal the entire plenitude of its existence, becomes the foundation of health. This degree of moderate tension is always more or less altered in a state of disease.\n\nLittle satisfied with all the theories founded on a gross of Stahl's mechanism, and convinced of their insufficiency to explain the phenomena of vitality, Stahl admitted forces that were something more than mechanical, and that were directed by an intelligent principle which applies them to their destined uses, and which, by distributing them with a wise economy, proportions or accommodates them to the different occasions of the individual. His disciples consider Stahl as the first modern writer who has treated the science of man on a general plan, and according to a philosophical arrangement; and as his doctrine has still numerous advocates in the medical schools of France, we shall be somewhat more particular on it than on that of Hoffman.\n\nIn determining the limits between medicine and the other physical sciences, Stahl commences with separating from the former all those principles which, though true in themselves, have no relation to the nature of that science, which he considers as originating in observation alone. The knowledge of the physical state of the animal body cannot, he thinks, throw any light, either on the injuries to which it is exposed, or on the means of preventing or removing them. Consequently it is of little use in medicine, and has no right to govern an art, the object of which is, to remedy those injuries that threaten the human body. He proves that living bodies are freed from the necessary laws of mechanics, because all their actions tend to one common end\u2014an end which embraces the whole chain of the movements essential to life, and the means established for its preservation. The human body, by means of this mixture of mechanical and vital powers, tends naturally to self-destruction; but, on the other hand, the organic structure to which is attached the exercise of the actions peculiar to the human species, is founded on this mixture. It is therefore necessary that the body should be in a state of resisting this tendency, in order that it may be sustained; and as the corruptibility inherent in its nature, purifies it through every period of its existence, the opposing action necessary to prevent the corruption from taking place, must also be exercised without intermission. It is this preserving action that constitutes the essence of life.\n\nThe preservation of the body is indeed effected by a sort of mechanical action; it requires the corporeal organs as its instruments, and it depends on different coexistent and successive actions. Health is the result of that just conformation of the organs which enables them to perform their functions with ease.\n\nThe exact conformity which subsists between the structure of each organ, and the functions it is destined to perform, demonstrates to the philosophical eye an intelligent and wise principle, that in the formation of organized bodies directs and prescribes every thing in","sp":58,"ep":63},{"h":"HORACE","t":"M.

We know that all mammalia except those which Cuvier calls edentata, as the ant-eaters, pangolins, and platypus, have teeth, fitted both for dividing and chewing their food; but here an important difference takes place. Those animals which live chiefly on animal food, have most of their teeth sharp and pointed, for the purpose of seizing and tearing their prey, while the granivorous and carnivorous animals have very large and strong grinders, in which the hard substance commonly called enamel (or what Blake calls corpus stratum,) forms alternate layers with the bony part. Such are also found in most reptiles and serpents, and in many fishes; but in some of these the teeth seem less to serve the purpose of dividing the food, than to seize and retain it till swallowed. Birds of the Teeth have no teeth, though some of them have the mandibles of the bill so formed as to divide and cut in pieces their food.\n\nDuring mastication the food is mixed with the saliva, and is thus better fitted for easy solution in the stomach. This infalivation of the food may, however, take place, without previous mastication. It is common for serpents to swallow their food whole; but in order to facilitate its passage down the throat, they first besmear it all over with their mucous saliva. In many animals, a process similar to infalivation takes place, while the food remains in the mouth. In several species of the ape tribe there is a pouch situated on each side of the jaw, and in these pouches the greater part of the food is retained, not merely as some supposito, to serve as a future meal, but to undergo a dilution by the fluids that are there secreted. In granivorous birds, the food is first received into a membranous bag, formed by a dilation of the gullet, and commonly called the crop, where it is macerated by the fluids that are there separated by means of glands or exhaling velluses, and passes down, as the animal requires, to be further prepared by the stomach. The buffard, indeed, though a granivorous bird, has no proper crop, but the gullet is furnished with numerous and large glands.\n\nFor an account of the chemical nature and properties of saliva, see Chemistry, No. 2723.\n\nThe operation of deglutition depends chiefly on the action of the tongue, and on that of the muscles which surround the pharynx and gullet. It is more or less speedy in proportion as these are more or less active and vigorous. Most animals, after having once swallowed their food, do not receive it again into the mouth; but this takes place in several tribes, and is called rumination, or chewing the cud.\n\nRumination takes place chiefly in those animals that feed on herbage, and have not a muscular stomach; such as all the tribes that Linnaeus has ranked under the order pecora. In these the food, after being slightly chewed, is received into the first stomach, and after remaining there for a short time, it is gradually brought by a retrograde action of the gullet into the mouth, where it undergoes a complete tituration and infalivation.\ntion, and is then conveyed into the 2d, 3d, and 4th stomachs, to be mixed with the gastric juice.\n\nSome of those birds which have a diluting sac or ingluvies, seem likewise to ruminate. This in the parrot was observed by the gentlemen of the French academy. It has since been observed in rooks, macaws, cockatoos, and others; and Mr Hunter, to whom physiology is so much indebted, discovered that the male and the female pigeon secrete in their ingluvies a certain liquor for feeding their young; and that most kinds of what have been thought ruminating birds do very often in expressing their fondness regurgitate their food. Yet both this and another species of regurgitation which is very common with those animals that swallow indigestible substances with their food, should be carefully distinguished from rumination. For a farther account of rumination, and of the digestive organs of ruminating animals, see Comparative Anatomy, No. 228\u2014234, and Phil. Trans. 1807, Part ii.\n\nThe food having entered the stomach, undergoes at that organ processes that are partly mechanical, or rather organic, and partly chemical, depending on the structure of the stomach, and the nature of the juices secreted into its cavity. By these actions it is reduced into a pulpy substance commonly called chyme.\n\nThe organic action of the stomach is greater or less, according as this organ is more or less muscular. There are many animals, chiefly birds of the granivorous tribes, that have a very muscular stomach, commonly called gizzard, capable of grinding, not only the grains received into it, but even of reducing to powder small pieces of glass, and of blunting the points of needles and lancets. These facts were first proved by Borelli, who introduced into the gizzards of fowls, nuts, filberts, hollow spheres of glass, hollow cubes of lead, small pyramids of wood, and several other substances, which he found were either crushed together, or broken to pieces. He computes the power exerted by the stomach of the Indian cock as equal to the pressure of 1350 pounds weight. These experiments were repeated and verified by Spallanzani.\n\nSome animals that are not possessed of a muscular stomach have, within that organ, teeth, or other hard bodies, for the purpose of breaking or grinding their food. This is the case with many of the crustacea, as crabs and lobsters.\n\nA great many animals have what Spallanzani calls intermediate stomachs, i.e., not so muscular as the gizzard of fowls, nor so membranous as the stomachs of ruminating animals; this is the case with many birds, as ravens, crows, herons, &c. The stomachs of these animals are possessed of considerable force, though this is not nearly equal to that exerted by the gizzard. These animals possess the power of rejecting by the mouth the substances that are incapable of digestion in the stomach, every nine, or sometimes every three hours.\n\nThe animals with membranous stomachs are very numerous, comprehending man, most beasts and birds of prey; many reptiles, snakes, fish, &c. The stomachs of these animals are susceptible of but little muscular action, though in many species they both contract upon the food, and reject it through the gullet, on various occasions. Birds of prey, like the ravens, crows, &c., possess the power of rejecting, in the form of pellets, the indigestible parts of their food, which usually takes place every 24 hours.\n\nA most interesting paper by Mr Everard Home is published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1807, Discoveries part ii. on the structure and functions of the stomachs of various animals. We regret that we can here give Home little more than the results of his inquiries.\n\nFrom previous investigations respecting the stomachs of ruminating animals, Mr Home was led to believe that the fourth stomach in these tribes was either always, or during digestion, divided into two portions, each performing a different office in the digestive process; and he even conjectured, that a similar division might take place in other animals.\n\nMr Home has examined the stomachs of a great variety of animals, and investigated the progress of digestion in ruminants, the hare tribe, which occasionally ruminate, the beaver, dormouse, water-rat, common rat, mouse, horse, and ass, kangaroo, peccary, hippopotamus, elephant, the cetacea, fowls, and lastly in man.\n\nThe human stomach appears to be the uniting link between those that are fitted only to digest vegetable substances, and those of animals that are entirely carnivorous; and yet we find, that in its internal structure it is in every material respect similar both to those of the plantigrade monkey and squirrel, which usually digest only vegetable food, and to those of carnivorous animals.\n\nThe human stomach is occasionally divided into a cardiac and a pyloric portion, by a muscular contraction similar to that of other animals; and as this circum-pyloric formation has not before been noticed, it is proper to be more particular in describing it.\n\nThe first instance in which Mr Home observed this muscular contraction in the human stomach, was in a woman who died in consequence of being burnt, and who had been unable to take much nourishment for several days before her death. The stomach was found empty, and was taken out of the body at a very early period after death. It was carefully inverted to expose its internal surface, and gently distended with air. The contraction was so permanent, that after the stomach had been kept in water, in an inverted state, for several days, and at different times distended with air, the appearance was not altogether destroyed.\n\nSince that time, Mr Home has taken every opportunity of examining the human stomach shortly after death; and he finds that this contraction, in a greater or less degree, is very generally met with. He is of opinion that this effect is not produced by a peculiar band of muscular fibres, but that it arises from the muscular coat, in the middle part of the stomach, being thrown into action to a greater or less extent according to circumstances. When this part of the stomach is examined by dissection, its muscular fibres are not to be distinguished from the rest. If the body be examined so late as 24 hours after death, this appearance is rarely met with, a circumstance which accounts for its not having before been particularly noticed.\n\nThat the food is dissolved in the cardiac portion of food first the human stomach, is proved by this part only being dissolved in found digested after death; the instances of which are diac sufficiently numerous to require no addition being made to them. This could not take place unless the solvent liquor was deposited there. Mr Hunter goes so far as to\nto say in his paper on this subject, \"there are few dead bodies in which the stomach at its great end is not in some degree digested.\"\n\nThat the chyle is not formed there, and that it is commonly formed before the food passes through the pylorus, is proved by the result of some experiments made by Mr Hunter upon dogs, in the year 1765. The dogs were killed while digestion was going on; and in all, the food was least dissolved, or even mixed, towards the great end of the stomach, but became more and more towards the pylorus, just within which it was mixed with a whitish fluid like cream.\n\nFrom the result of these experiments, as well as from the analogy of other animals, it is reasonable to believe, that the glands situated at the termination of the cuticular lining of the oesophagus, which are described by Mr Home, secrete the solvent liquor, which is occasionally poured on the food, so as to be intimately mixed with it before it is removed from the cardiac portion; and the muscular contraction retains it there, till this takes place.\n\nSuch contraction being occasionally required in the stomach, accounts for its being more or less bent upon itself, as by this structure it is more readily divided into two portions, by the action of the muscular fibres at that part where the angle is formed.\n\nThis contraction also explains why the contents of the stomach are not completely discharged from the first effect of an emetic; and by it Mr Home thinks we may explain the cramp of the stomach, and some kinds of indigestion.\n\nAfter comparing the stomachs of several carnivorous animals with that of man; in tracing the gradation from carnivorous beasts through the bat tribe to birds of prey, Mr Home remarks that \"the only real link between the stomachs of quadrupeds and birds is that of the ornithorhynchus (or platypus), which, however, is more an approach to the gizzard, being lined with a cuticle containing sand, and having the same relative situation to the oesophagus and duodenum. The food of this animal is not known; it is probably of both kinds; the papillae at the pylorus, which appear to be the secreting ducts of glands, are peculiar to it.\n\nFrom the facts and observations brought forward in this valuable paper, Mr Home deduces the following general conclusions. \"That the solvent liquor is secreted from glands of a somewhat similar structure in all animals, but much larger and more conspicuous in some than in others.\n\n\"That these glands are always situated near the orifice of the cavity, the contents of which are exposed to their secretion.\n\n\"That the viscid substance found on the internal membrane of all the stomachs that were examined recently after death, is reduced to this state by a secretion from the whole surface of the stomach, which coagulates albumen. This appears to be proved, by every part of the fourth cavity of the calf's stomach having the property of coagulating milk.\n\n\"This property in the general secretion of the stomach leads to an opinion, that the conglutination of fluid substances is necessary for their being acted on by the solvent liquor; and a practical observation of the late Mr Hunter, that weak stomachs can digest only solid food, is in confirmation of it.\n\n\"That in converting animal and vegetable substances into chyle, the food is first intimately mixed with the general secretions of the stomach, and after it has been acted on by them, the solvent liquor is poured upon it, by which the nutritious part is dissolved. This solution is afterwards conveyed into the pyloric portion, where it is mixed with the secretions peculiar to that cavity, and converted into chyle.\n\n\"The great strength of the muscles of the pyloric portion of some stomachs will, by their action, compress the contents, and separate the chyle from the indigestible part of the food.\n\n\"In animals whose food is easy of digestion, the stomach consists of a cardiac and pyloric portion only; but in those whose food is difficult of digestion, other parts are superadded, in which it undergoes a preparation before it is submitted to that process.\"\n\nThe action of the juices of the stomach, or of what we call the gastric juice, appears to have much more effect in the process of chymification, than the muscular juice. Action of the stomach, though the dissolving power of this fluid seems to be proportionally less in those animals that have the most muscular stomachs. The gastric juice of granivorous birds is capable of dissolving flesh; but when this is entire, it requires four or five days for solution; whereas when bruised, half that time is sufficient. Even grain is not dissolved in it except when bruised. The gastric juice of animals with intermediate stomachs dissolves flesh and cartilage, but not bone. It is incapable of dissolving entire seeds. In animals with membranous stomachs, the gastic juice is extremely active, and seems to be almost the only agent in the digestive process. In some of these animals, however, as the ruminating tribes, this fluid has no effect on the food, unless it be bruised, or thoroughly masticated. Spallanzani found, that owls digest flesh and bones, but not grain\u2014that the gastic juice of the eagle dissolves bread and bone, and even animal and vegetable matters, when it is taken out of the body\u2014that a wood pigeon may be gradually brought to live on flesh\u2014that the owl and falcon do not digest bread\u2014that the gastic juice of the dog dissolves even the enamel of the teeth.\n\nHence, in every order of animals, the gastic juice is the principal cause of digestion, and it agrees in all in many properties, and differs in others. In the frog, the newt, fleshy fishes, and other cold-blooded animals, it produces digestion in a temperature nearly equal to that of the atmosphere. In warm blooded animals it is capable of dissolving the aliment in a degree of heat lower than that of these animals. In them too the food is digested in a few hours, whereas in the opposite kind it requires several days, and even weeks, particularly in serpents; likewise, the gastic juice of the gallinaceous clafs can dissolve only bodies of a soft and yielding texture, and previously triturated; whilst in others, as serpents, the heron, birds of prey, and the dog, it decomposes substances of great tenacity, as ligaments and tendons; and even of considerable hardness, as the most compact bone. Man belongs to this class, but his gastic juice seems to have no action on the hardest kinds of bones. Some species, likewise, are incapable of digesting vegetables, as birds of prey; but man, the dog, cat, crows, &c., dissolve the individuals of both kingdoms alike, and are omnivorous, and in general their gastic juices produce these effects out of the body.\nFor an account of the chemical nature and properties of the gastric juice, see Chemistry, No. 2551.\n\nThe process of chymification depends also, in a great measure, on the nature of the substances employed as food, as some of these are much more soluble than others. On this subject much information may be derived by consulting the experiments of Dr Stark*, and those of M. Goffe of Geneva, an abstract of which is given in Johnson's Animal Chemistry, vol. i. p. 207. From the latter experiments it appears, 1/3, That the following substances are either insoluble, or are not digested in the usual time in the stomach.\n\n**Animal substances.**\n1.

Ligneous stones of fruits.\n10. The gastric juice does not destroy the life of some seeds; hence bitter-root, hemp, miltetoe, and other plants which sometimes grow upon trees, are produced by the means of the excrements of birds, the kernels of seeds being defended from the menstrum by their exterior covering.\n\n2d, That the following are partly soluble, viz:\n1.

White of cabbage less soluble than red.\n3. Beet, cardoons, onions, and leeks.\n4. Root of curvy-grafts, red and yellow carrots, fiscory, are more insoluble in the form of salad than any other way.\n5. Pulp of fruit with acids, when not fluid.\n6. Warm bread and sweet pastry, from their producing acidity.\n7. Fresh and dry figs. By frying all these substances in butter or oil they become still less soluble. If they are not dissolved in the stomach, they are, however, in the course of their passage through the intestines.\n\n3d, That the following are soluble, or easy of digestion, being generally reduced to chyme in an hour, or an hour and a half.\n\n**Animal Substances.**\n1. Veal, lamb, and in general the flesh of young animals, are sooner dissolved than that of old.\n2. Fresh eggs.\n3. Cows milk.\n4. Perch boiled with a little salt and parsley. When fried or seasoned with oil, wine, and white sauce, it is not so soluble.\n\n**Vegetable Substances.**\n1. Herbs, as spinach, mixed with horseradish, are less soluble.\n2. Celery. Tops of alfalfa, hops, and the ornithogalum of the Pyrenees.\n3. Bottom of artichokes.\n4. Boiled pulp of fruits, seasoned with sugar.\n5. Pulp or meal of farinaceous seeds.\n6. Different sorts of wheaten bread, without butter, the second day after baking; the crust more so than the crumb.\n7. Salted bread of Geneva more so than that of Paris without salt; brown bread in proportion as it contains more bran is less soluble.\n8. Rapes, turnips, potatoes, parsnips, not too old.\n9. Gum arabic, but its acid is soon felt. The Arabians use it as food.\n\nThe solvent power of the gastric juice is increased by various stimulants, especially by those called condiments, as sea salt, spices, mustard, vinegar, as well as by various and spirituous liquors and old cheese in small quantities, and by various bitters. It is retarded by large quantities of diluting liquors, especially when taken hot; by acids and astringents taken a short time after eating; by unctuous substances; by mental employment, or severe bodily exercise, too soon after a meal; and by leaning with the breast against a table.\n\nIt may be proper here to notice the various opinions that have been entertained respecting the immediate theories of cause of digestion. The principal of these opinions are, digestion, that it is produced by coction or heat; by trituration in the stomach; by fermentation, or by putrefaction.\n\nThat it is not brought about by heat alone, will appear from the circumstance, that many cold-blooded animals digest their food as completely, though not so expeditiously, as warm-blooded animals.\n\nThat it is not effected by trituration in the stomach alone, is evident from the experiments that have been made by Spallanzani, Stevens, and others, of giving to animals food enclosed in hollow perforated balls, sufficiently strong to resist the muscular power of the stomach; as the balls have been found empty, and not compressed.\n\nThat it is not owing to fermentation is proved by the circumstance, that the more perfectly digestion proceeds, the less is the evolution of gases in the stomach; the contrary of which would be the case, if digestion consisted in a fermentation of the aliment.\n\nThat it does not depend on putridity, is evidenced by the observations that have been made on putrid food given to dogs, and examined some time after, when it was found perfectly sweet.\n\nOn the whole it appears, that in most animals the digestion of food in the stomach depends partly on a due degree of heat, partly on the vital action of the stomach, but chiefly on the action of the gastric juice.\n\nWhen the aliment has been converted into the stomach, the crude pulp called chyme, they are gradually propelled through the pylorus into the duodenum, where they are mixed with the bile, the pancreatic juice, and the fluids that are separated by the mucous coat of that intestine, and are thus reduced to a still finer pulp, containing, as one of its principal ingredients, the nutritious fluid called chyle, the nature and properties of which, as they have been but slightly mentioned in the former parts of this work, fall to be noticed here.\n\nThe properties of chyle have not been minutely investigated; but according to Fordyce, as far as experience has been carried, the chyle of quadrupeds is so similar to that of man, and of each other, as hardly to be distinguished, even in tribes the most opposite to each other in their structure, food, and habits of life. As far as we can perceive, the chyle of a dog or a wolf differs in nothing from that of a sheep or an ox.\n\nThe chyle consists of three parts; one part which is fluid, and contained in the lacteals, but coagulates on extravasation.\n\nThe second part consists of a fluid, which is coagulable by heat, and in all its properties hitherto observed, it is similar to the serum of the blood.\n\nThe third part consists of globules, which render the whole white and opake. These globules have been supposed by many to be an expressed oil; but this has not been proved. Neither has it been perfectly demonstrated that sugar is contained in the chyle, although it has\nbeen made very probable. The difficulty of determining these points arises from the small quantity that can be collected, the largest animals not supplying more than one ounce or two, at the most. However, the part coagulating on extravasation; the part agreeing with serum in its qualities; the globular part, which in some animals, but not in quadrupeds, exits without giving whiteness to the chyle\u2014alone, or along with sugar, form the essential parts of the chyle.\n\nThe compound pulpy matter containing the chyle is carried forward from the duodenum through the whole course of the intestines, where it is subjected to the continual action of the internal wrinkled membrane of the bowels, and its nutritious particles, or chyle, selected and absorbed by the lacteals that are abundantly distributed there, and open their mouths directly within the cavity.\n\nAs to the movements of the alimentary canal, the direction of hairs found in the stomach, and the balls through the intestines, where they are thrown up, would appear to indicate a circular motion. The intestinal part has a motion similar to that of a worm, and is called the vermicular or peristaltic. Here every portion retains its own motion, although it be separated from the rest by ligatures. The stomach of the polype, the gullets of the ruminating kinds, and the ceca, have the motion in different directions at different times; and that observed in the alimentary canal of a loupe is, when viewed through a microscope in the time of action, amazingly rapid; the stimulating causes employed are the food, the different liquids with which it is mixed, the air, the nerves where they exist, and a portion of heat. Some degree of heat is necessary to every process of digestion, both in the animal and vegetable kingdom; what that degree is depends on the nature of the living body; and is various according to its age, its health, its employments, and habits.\n\nWith respect to the function of digestion in the lower classes of animals, we can say but little. We know that their food is dissolved in the stomachs of the crustacea, of mollusca, and of polypes; but whether this process in most insects and worms is anything more than imbibition, or taking in aliment, which is to undergo little change, we are uncertain. We know, indeed, that many insects live on substances which must be dissolved before they enter into the pores of their bodies, and that many of them abound in acid juices, which are well fitted for this solution. It does not appear that plants possess what may be called the faculty of digestion.\n\nThe relations between digestion and the functions we have already considered, especially sensation, are various and important. The sympathies that exist between the head and the stomach, have been long acknowledged. Several affections of the brain are accompanied with sickness at the stomach, loss of appetite, and indigestion; while, on the other hand, the deranged state of the digestive organs seldom fails to produce giddiness, headache, ringing in the ears, confusion or deprivation of sight, &c.; and if the former symptoms arise to a great height, as in the case of overloaded stomach or surfeit, coma, or even apoplexy, is frequently produced. In many nervous affections, particularly hysteria and hypochondriasis, in which there frequently takes place alternating accumulations of air in the stomach and bowels, the affections of the head, such as stupor, confusion of thought, partial blindness, &c., sometimes proceed to such a height, as to threaten, or even sometimes to produce, an apoplectic paroxysm. In many cases these affections are referred immediately to the head; but are proved, in most instances, to depend on the disordered state of the alimentary canal, from the immediate relief procured by those remedies which promote the discharge of air, or produce copious evacuation from the bowels.\n\nOn the other hand, in some diseases, where the head is primarily affected, as in phrenitis hydrocephalica (water in the head), the complaint is referred to the bowels, from the colic pains or other disordered state of these. The daily experience of literary men shows how much intense thought diminishes the digestive powers, and how imperfectly studious occupations can be carried on after a full meal. The action of the digestive organs is also considerably influenced by the mind, or the passions. We know how readily the appetite may be diminished or destroyed by sudden anger or affliction.\n\nThe action of the stomach may even be influenced by the will. We have known a person who could vomit whenever he pleased; and Dr Darwin speaks of another who had acquired this voluntary command over the inverted motions of the stomach and throat, to such a degree, as to gain a subsistence by exhibiting these unnatural powers to the public. At these exhibitions he was accustomed to swallow a pint of red rough gooseberries, and a pint of white smooth ones; to bring them up in small parcels into his mouth, and restore them separately to the spectators, who called for red or white, as they pleased, till the whole were redelivered.\n\nThe sympathies that take place between the brain and the digestive organs, are easily explained, from considering the distribution of the great sympathetic nerve, to illustrate which we have given a figure (fig. 1) showing its course and distribution from the head through the chest, as far as the stomach.\n\nThe relations between the digestive and the locomotive functions, are not less obvious. Experience shows between how much digestion depends on regular exercise, and how imperfectly it is carried on in the stomach of the indolent and sedentary; while, on the other hand, when the stomach is overloaded, voluntary motion becomes difficult and fatiguing. Spasmodic contractions of the muscles, twitchings of the limbs, and similar affections, are the common attendants of indigestion, though these may perhaps be referred equally to the nervous as to the muscular system.\n\nThe principal morbid affections of digestion are, nausea, flatulence, eructation, rumination (G), vomiting, heartburn, digestion.\n\n(c) That ruminating power which is natural to the quadrupeds of the order Pecora, is sometimes met with in man. We have heard of persons who regularly brought up their food into the mouth soon after eating, chewed it over again, swallowed the juices with the saliva, and spat out the more solid parts. In these cases, the rumination is\nChap. VI. Of Absorption.\n\nWe have said that the chyle is taken up from the compound pulpy matter composed of the food and the animal juices, as it passes through the intestines, by the lacteals. This, however, is not the only absorption that takes place in the animal body. The fluids poured out into cavities by the exhalant arteries, as well as all the secreted or exuding fluids, and even the solid materials of the system, are taken up by the lymphatics, and carried into the circulation; the blood poured out into cells in some parts, is evidently absorbed by veins; and, as we shall endeavour to prove, an absorption takes place over the external surface of the body.\n\nWhat is called the absorbent system, is composed, in the superior animals, of the lacteals, the mesenteric glands, the thoracic duct, the lymphatics, and the lymphatic glands. For an account of these in man, see Anatomy, Part I. Sect. i. This system, in a greater or less degree, is found in all animals, except some mollusca, insects, worms, and zoophytes. See Cuvier's Legons, tom. iv. lec. xxviii. and Blumenbach's Comparative Anatomy, chap. xiii.\n\nThe action of the lacteals and lymphatics is probably much the same, and is exerted in a similar manner. That of the lacteals is to convey the nourishing parts of the food into the circulating system; that of the lymphatics to carry to the same system watery fluids, for the purpose of diluting the blood, and such fluid or solid materials as are useless, or may prove noxious to the system. The action of the lacteals may be readily seen on opening an animal killed two or three hours after eating; and in this way they were first seen by Afellius. They are then found filled with a milky fluid, while, at other times, they are invisible. That the lymphatics are the principal organs of absorption, is now the general opinion of all physiologists, though their action in this way can seldom be demonstrated. As, however, it has been satisfactorily proved, that the veins do not in general absorb, and as the lymphatics that proceed from parts that contain irritating matters, are often seen inflamed, proving that they have imbibed a part of the irritating matter, there is little doubt that the office of absorption belongs almost exclusively to the action of the lymphatics.\n\nMr John Hunter made several experiments to show that the veins do not absorb. He conveyed milk, coloured with various dyeing substances, or perfumed with musk, into the small intestine of an ass, which was soon after killed. On opening the veins of the intestine, and veins allowing the blood to separate into serum and coagulum, the serum was found neither to be tinged with the colouring matters, nor scented by the perfume, while the coloured milk was evident in the lacteals. That the veins, however, do in some cases perform the office of absorbents, is evident from the speedy depletion of the corpora cavernosa penis, after having been distended with arterious blood; and from a similar depletion that takes place in the nipple of the female breast.\n\nThe principal object in dispute respecting the function of absorption in man and the higher classes of animals, is whether the skin possesses the power of absorption. This question, as it is both curious and important, we shall examine pretty much at large; and for this purpose we shall avail ourselves of an able paper on the subject, by Dr George Kellic.\n\nIt had long been received as an established truth, that the skin was an inhaling or an absorbing organ, and that sometimes the inhalation balanced, or even surpassed, the exhalation of the cutaneous surface; but of late this doctrine of inhalation has been called in question, and, in the opinion of many, entirely overthrown. It has been said, that this absorption neither does nor can take place on the outside of the cuticle; that in every case of apparent absorption, the epidermis had been injured, or that the matter absorbed had been mechanically forced through it, and brought into immediate contact with the skin.\n\nHaller had asserted *, on the authority of Default, * Elementa that the body acquired an increase of weight in the Physio-warm bath; and this augmentation of weight was *gise*, tom. v. esteemed an experimentum crucis in favour of cutaneous absorption.\n\nExperiments, however, have since been made with every necessary care, which seem to contradict the position, and to prove, that the body acquires no additional weight in the warm bath.\n\nSeguin, from a great many experiments of this description, concludes, that there is no inhalation, because the body, so far from gaining, always loses some part of its weight during immersion, although much less than in the air in equal times +.\n\nIn other experiments again, as in those of Gerard and Currie, there was no increase of weight; but the body was\n\nis to be considered as a disease, depending on the inability of the stomach to propel the solid food into the duodenum.\n\nMr Home, in the paper we have already quoted, (N\u00b0 161\u2014169), relates a curious instance of habitual rumination in a man 19 years of age, who is blind, and has been an idiot from his birth. He has a very ravenous appetite, and it is necessary to restrict him in the quantity of his food, since, if he eats too much, it disorders his bowels. Fluid food does not remain on his stomach, but comes up again. He swallows his dinner, which consists of a pound and a half of meat and vegetables in two minutes, and in about 15 minutes he begins to chew the cud. Mr Home was once present on this occasion. The moriel is brought up from the stomach with apparently a very slight effort, and the muscles of the throat are seen in action when it comes into the mouth; he chews it three or four times, and swallows it; there is then a pause, and another moriel is brought up. This process is continued for about half an hour, and he appears to be more quiet at that time than at any other. Whether the regurgitation of the food is voluntary or involuntary, cannot be ascertained, the man being too deficient in understanding, to give any information on the subject.\nwas not observed to have lost anything during immersion in the warm bath.\n\nNow, during these experiments, the body was doubtless wasting by the pulmonary and cutaneous discharges, and yet the weight of the body either continued unchanged; or where a loss of weight was observed, this was constantly less, greatly less, than is experienced during the same interval in air. And we might be inclined to infer, from a truth so general, and so well ascertained, an argument in favour of absorption.\n\nIt might be argued, that the loss of weight amounts to little or nothing, because, during immersion, the body acquires more by inhalation than it does or can do in the air; that the loss by the pulmonary and cutaneous discharges is counterbalanced, or nearly counterbalanced, by the increased absorption.\n\nThose, however, who deny absorption, will not allow us the advantage of this argument. They tell us, that the exhalation by the skin and lungs is diminished, which sufficiently explains why the body loses less in the warm bath than in air. But that the accustomed discharges are suppressed or diminished in the warm or tepid bath, is, we apprehend, far from being proved; and, till this proposition is made good, the argument against cutaneous inhalation cannot be securely maintained.\n\nOne of Dr Currie's cases deserves farther consideration. We allude to the case of dysphagia, published by this gentleman, in which Mr M., the subject of the case, was several times immersed in a warm bath of milk and water, and was weighed when taken out. Mr M. it is true, gained no weight while in the warm bath; but the loss continually going on in the air was, as in other trials, suspended during the immersions. Besides, he always expressed great comfort from the bath, with abatement of thirst; and, subsequent to the daily use of it, the urine flowed more plentifully, and became less pungent. An observation, precisely similar, is made by Mr Cruickshank. \"A patient of mine (says Mr Cruickshank), with a stricture of the oesophagus, received nothing, either solid or liquid, into the stomach for two months; he was exceedingly thirsty, and complained of making no water. I ordered him the warm bath for an hour, evening and morning, for a month; his thirst vanished, and he made water in the same manner as when he used to drink by the mouth (ii) *.\n\nBut to return to the case of Mr M. \u2014 Dr Currie himself remarks, that the discharge by urine alone exceeded much in weight the waste of his whole body; and it cannot be doubted that the discharge by stool and perspiration exceeded the weight of the clysters.\u2014Thus it appears, that the egesta exceeded the ingesta in a proportion much greater than the waste of his body will explain. How is this accounted for, Dr Currie asks, unless by cutaneous absorption?\n\nThat the excess of these discharges above the ingesta and total waste, can be accounted for by absorption only, was indeed an irresistible conclusion. Still, however, cutaneous absorption is denied; and, when forced to confess, that there are cases where the egesta exceed the ingesta in a much greater proportion than the waste of the body will explain, and which can only be accounted for by absorption, they refuse this function to the skin, and below it most liberally, and, in so far as we know, most gratuitously, on the lungs. We are not entitled, in return, to deny the reality of pulmonary absorption, but we may surely be allowed to urge, that there is no proof that the only inhaling organ is in the lungs; and there is none against the possibility of cutaneous absorption.\n\nIs it not, on the other hand, proved, by the experiments of Seguin and Lavoisier, that the exhalation greatly exceeds the absorption by the pulmonary system? And if this is always the case, we cannot explain by pulmonary inhalation alone, why the egesta should, in some cases, exceed the ingesta in a much greater proportion than the waste of the body will account for.\n\nWe now proceed to examine another class of experiments, much insisted on by those who deny cutaneous absorption; we mean those experiments performed by immersing a part of the body in solutions of active drugs, the absorption of which should be indicated by their usual effects on the system.\n\nSeguin made numerous experiments of this kind, with solutions of muriate of mercury (corrosive sublimate), on typhilitic patients. And we are informed, that in cases where the epidermis was perfectly found, neither the known effects of mercury on the body, nor any amelioration of the venereal symptoms, was ever observed.\n\nHe also immersed his own arm in a solution of two drams of the mercurial muriate in ten pounds of water. At the temperature of 12\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 R\u00e9aumur, no part of the salt was missing at the end of the experiment; but when the bath was at 18\u00b0 of the same scale, there was a loss of one or two grains of the muriate in the hour, though the quantity of fluid was not diminished.\n\nThe explanation given by Seguin of this unexpected result is curiously ingenious, but embarrassed, and inconsistent.\n\nAt the temperature of 12\u00b0, he observes, the exhalants are in a state of contraction, and their orifices nearly closed. When the heat again is raised to 26\u00b0, the exhalation is so rapid, that nothing can enter the vessels from without; but at 18\u00b0 of temperature, the orifices of the exhalants are sufficiently relaxed, and the exhalation at the same time so conveniently languid, that the solution rests quietly in contact with the matter of perspiration in the mouths of the exhalants, where it is somehow or other decomposed; a part of the salt leaving the water of solution, and combining with the perspirative matter, with which it is carried into the system *. Carried into the circulation by the exhalants! Is not this a plain acknowledgment of the reality of inhalation? But if in one case substances may thus be carried into the circulation, why not in many others?\n\nSurely if the weight continues undiminished, in circumstances\n\n(h) That thirst may be allayed by immersion in water, is fully proved by the experience of shipwrecked mariners, who, when obliged to take to their boats with very little fresh water, frequently have recourse to bathing in the sea, or covering themselves with a shirt wetted in salt water, and thus quench their thirst, nearly as well as if they had drunk fresh water.\ncircumstances where the body is continually losing, we may infer, that something has been gained by absorption.\n\nAnd where the egesta exceed the ingesta in a proportion much greater than the waste of the body will explain, there abortion must have been going on.\n\nThe case of Mr M\u2014, published by Dr Currie, is not singular. The writings of physicians abound in similar examples. They had often occurred to that excellent clinical practitioner De Haen, who was therefore persuaded that water was imbibed +. Haller too, with his usual industry, has collected a great many observations of the same kind \u2020.\n\nAgain, when physicians were engaged in their extensive statistical experiments, weighing themselves, their ingesta and egesta, for many months, nay for years together; they sometimes observed, that so far from losing, they had gained weight, especially during cold and moist weather. Thus, Rye, under a cold and humid atmosphere, gained 13 ounces. Limnings, during two hours exposure to cold, acquired 8\u00bd ounces. The Abb\u00e9 Fontana, after two hours exposure to a moist atmosphere, returned home some ounces heavier than he went out. De Gorter gained 6 ounces in one night; and on other occasions, two ounces and four ounces. These observations are confirmed also by the experience of Dr Francis Home, professor of Materia Medica in the university of Edinburgh. Having fatigued myself pretty much (says he) in the afternoon, I went to bed without supper, and was so hungry that I could not fall asleep for some time. Betwixt eleven at night and seven next morning I had gained two ounces \u2021.\n\nHere then are examples of the body gaining considerably more than the ingesta will account for, acquiring weight when neither food nor drink had been swallowed. And we have the concurring testimony of the most respectable writers supporting the same truth.\n\nHow can this increase of weight be accounted for, unless by absorption? In such experiments, the loss of weight, which cannot be accounted for by the sensible egesta, is attributed to the exhalation; the increased weight sometimes observed, and which cannot be explained by the sensible ingesta, must in like manner be referred to the inhalation.\n\nThat the system may be affected by active medicines introduced and absorbed by the skin, cannot be denied. And were proofs still wanting to establish the doctrine of cutaneous absorption, this argument might be insisted on. It is true, that friction is commonly employed when we wish to introduce medicines by the skin, by which, it is said, the substance is mechanically forced through the cuticle, and brought into contact with the absorbents of the true skin. The system, however, may be affected without friction, for example, by wearing a mercurial platter, and more certainly by mercurial fumigation, as practised by Lalonette and others *.\n\nIt might even be concluded from an examination of the structure of the skin, that absorption must take place at its surface. We know that the cuticle is porous, and is penetrated by exhaling vessels; we know that lymphatics commence immediately below it; and we know that when certain substances are applied to the cuticle, especially when this application is aided by moderate friction, as in the case of applying garlic poultices to the feet, and the more familiar instance of mercurial immersion, that these substances are taken up by the absorbents, and conveyed into the circulation.\n\nFrom a consideration of all these circumstances, we think it fully proved, that the skin is an absorbing or inhaling organ. For further proofs we may refer our readers to Bichat's Anat. Gener. tom. iv. p. 691.\n\nMr Charles Darwin, son of the late Dr Darwin, published in 1782, a Latin thesis, which is translated in the retrograde action of the lymphatics formed as in particular cases to admit of the regurgitation of the absorbed fluids. The arguments on which he founds this opinion (beside the difficulty of accounting for the phenomena of several diseases on any other principle), are chiefly the following:\n\nFirstly, The mouths of the lymphatics seem to allow water to pass through them after death, the inverted way, more easily than in the natural direction.\n\nSecondly, In some diseases, as diabetes and scrofula, it is probable the valves themselves are diseased, and are thence incapable of preventing the return of the fluids they should support.\n\nThirdly, There are valves in other parts of the body analogous to those of the absorbent system, which are liable, when diseased, to regurgitate their contents.\n\nFourthly, The capillary vessels, which must be considered as analogous to absorbents, may be seen, in animals submitted to the microscope, to regurgitate their contents into the arteries, during the struggles of the dying animal.\n\nBy means of this hypothesis (for notwithstanding the arguments adduced in its favour, we can call it no better), Mr Darwin explained the speedy passage of watery fluids from the stomach to the urinary bladder; the phenomena of diabetes; diarrhoea, dropy, cold sweats; translations of matter, chyle, milk, and urine; the operation of external remedies, &c.\n\nIn all those classes of animals that possess a complete Absorption absorbent system, the phenomena of absorption seem to proceed much in the same manner as in man; but in some of the inferior animals, especially in mollusca and worms this function seems to be performed by the veins *. Cuvier in the echinodermata, however, especially in the sea-urchins, echin (echinus esculentus), lymphatics have been demonstrated by the second Monro. In insects and polypes there is no proper absorption.\n\nThe absorbing vessels of plants are chiefly the fibrils of the roots, which evidently imbibe moisture, and perhaps gaseous fluids, from the earth; but there have also been demonstrated vessels opening beneath the outer bark, which botanical physiologists consider as lymphatics. \"Lymphatic vessels (says Wildenow), are found in the epidermis of plants, and are of great minuteness, anastomosing in various ways through small intermediate branches.\" They surround the apertures of the cuticle, by which the inhalation and exhalation of vegetables are carried on; but they are so minute as not to have yet been filled with coloured liquids. Round each opening, which is commonly flat by a moveable valve, they form a circle, rarely a rhombus, as in the zea mays. In the lilium candidum, these vessels run obliquely, and somewhat in an irregular undulating manner, fig. 2. In the common onion (allium cepa), they run in a straight, though oblique and regular form, fig. 3. In the pine, (Pinus)","sp":92,"ep":99},{"h":"NUTRITION","t":"9.

In the first place, then, as it is the interest of every planter to preserve his negroes in health and strength; so every act of cruelty is not less repugnant to the master's real profit, than it is contrary to the laws of humanity: and if a manager considers his own ease and his employee's interest, he will treat all negroes under his care with due benevolence; for good discipline is by no means inconsistent with humanity: on the contrary, it is evident from experience, that he who feeds his negroes well, proportions their labour to their age, sex, and strength, and treats them with kindness and good nature, will reap a much larger product, and with infinitely more ease and self-satisfaction, than the most cruel taskmaster, who starves his negroes, or chastises them with undue severity. Every planter then who wishes to grow rich with ease, must be a good economist; must feed his negroes with the most wholesome food, sufficient to preserve them in health and vigour. Common experience points out the methods by which a planter may prefer his people in health and strength. Some of his most fruitful land should be allotted to each negro in proportion to his family, and a sufficient portion of time allowed for the cultivation of it; but because such allotment cannot in long droughts produce enough for his comfortable support, it is the incumbent duty of a good planter to have always his stores well filled with Guinea corn, yams, or eddoes, besides potatoes growing in regular succession: for plenty begets cheerfulness of heart, as well as strength of body; by which more work is effected in a day by the same hands than in a week when enervated by want and feverishness. Scanty meals may sustain life; but it is evident, that more is requisite to enable a negro or any other person to go through the necessary labours. He, therefore, who will reap plentifully, must plant great abundance of provisions as well\nas sugar-canes; and it is nature's economy so to fructify the soil by the growth of yams, plantains, and potatoes, as to yield better harvests of sugar, by that very means, than can be produced by many other arts of cultivation. Plantains are the principal support of all the negroes in Jamaica; and are also much cultivated, at great expense of manure, in Barbadoes; but ought not to be solely depended upon in climates subject to hurricanes. A celebrated planter and economist of the last-mentioned island, who raised an immense fortune from very small beginnings only by planting, affirmed, that he fed constantly at least 300 negroes out of 12 acres of plantains. How that excellent produce came to be so long neglected in some of the islands it is hard to guess; but at present the neglect seems to be founded upon a vulgar error, that plantains cannot thrive in any other than low moist soils. In such places, no doubt, they flourish most luxuriantly; but yet they thrive and bear fruit abundantly on mountains and in marshes, and in the driest black mould upon marle or rocks, and even in sharp gravelly soils, as may be evinced by numberless instances.\n\nHowever plenty of wholesome food may be conducive to health, there are also other means, equally necessary to the strength and longevity of negroes, well worth the planter's attention: and those are, to choose airy dry situations for their houses; and to observe frequently that they be kept clean, in good repair, and perfectly water-tight; for nastiness, and the inclemencies of weather, generate the most malignant diseases. If these houses are situated also in regular order, and at due distances, the spaces may at once prevent general devastations by fire, and furnish plenty of fruits and pot-herbs, to please an unvitiated palate, and to purify the blood. Thus then ought every planter to treat his negroes with tenderness and generosity, that they may be induced to love and obey him out of mere gratitude, and become real good beings by the imitation of his behaviour; and therefore a good planter, for his own sake and happiness, will be careful of setting a good example.\n\nHaving thus hinted the duties of a planter to his negroes, let the next care be of cattle, mules, and horses. The planters of Barbadoes (who are perhaps the most skilful of all others, and exact to a nicety in calculations of profit and loss), are, with respect to their cattle, the most remiss of any in all the islands; as if the carriage of canes to the mill, and of plantation-produce to the market, was not as essential as any other branch of plantership. At Barbadoes, in particular, the care of these animals is of more importance: because the soil, worn out by long culture, cannot yield any produce without plenty of dung. Some planters are nevertheless so ingeniously thrifty, as to carry their canes upon negroes' heads; acting in that respect diametrically opposite to their own apparent interest, which cannot be served more effectually than by saving the labour of human hands, in all cases where the labour of brutes can be substituted; and for that end, no means of preserving those creatures in health and strength ought to be neglected.\n\nThe first care therefore is to provide plenty and variety of food. In crop-time, profusion of cane-tops may be had for the labour of carriage; but they will be more wholesome and nutritious if tedded like hay by the sun's heat, and sweated by laying them in heaps a few days before they are eaten. In this season of abundance, great ricks of cane-tops (the butt ends turned inwards) should be made in the most convenient corner of each field, to supply the want of pasturage and other food; and these are very wholesome if chopped into small parts, and mixed sometimes with common salt or sprinkled with molasses mixed with water; but yet the cattle require change of food to preserve them in strength; such as Guinea-corn, and a variety of grass, which every soil produces with a little care in moist weather; and indeed this variety is found necessary in all climes.\n\nBut since that variety is not to be had during those severe droughts to which hot climates are liable, and much less in those small islands which cannot furnish large tracts of meadow-lands for hay, the only resource is the fodder of cane-tops or tedded Guinea-corn leaves; which are very nutritious, and may be preserved in perfection for more than a whole year, provided the tops or Guinea-corn are well tedded for three or four hot days as they lie spread in the field; and then, being tied into bundles or sheaves, must lie in the hot sun for three or four days more, when they may be fit to be put up into ricks. The best method of making them is in an oblong figure, about 30 feet in length, and 16 or 18 feet wide; seven feet high at the sides, and from thence sloping like the roof of an house, the ridge of which must be thatched very carefully; for the sides may be secured from wet by placing the bundles with the butts upwards towards the ridge, in courses, and lapping the upper over the lower course.\n\nThe best method of forming those ricks is to place the first course of bundles all over the base one way; the second course reverely; and so alternately till therick be finished.\n\nWhen cattle are to be fed with this fodder, it must be observed to take down the bundles from the top, at the west end of the rick, to the bottom; for all these ricks must stand east and west lengthwise, as well to secure them from being overturned by high winds, as for the convenience of preserving them from wet, which cannot be done when ricks are made round. By this husbandry, a herd of cattle may be kept in strength; either in severe droughts, or in wet seasons when grass is purgative; and thus the necessity or expense of large pastures may be totally saved. The hay-knife used in England for cutting hay, answers for cutting ricks of tops.\n\nThe method of tedding Guinea-corn to make a kind of hay, will require a little explanation here. When Guinea-corn is planted in May, and to be cut down in July, in order to bear seed that year, that cutting, tedded properly, will make an excellent hay, which cattle prefer to meadow hay. In like manner, after Guinea-corn has done bearing seed, the after crop will furnish a great abundance of that kind of fodder which will keep well in ricks for two or three years.\n\nThe next care of a planter is to provide shade for his cattle; either by trees where they are fed in the heat of the day, if his soil requires not dung; or by building a flat shed over the pen where cattle are confined for making it. That such shades are essentially necessary to the well-being of all animals in hot weather, is apparent to every common observer, who cannot fail of seeing each creature forsaking the most luxuriant pastures in the heat of the day for the sake of shade; thus convincing\nvencing the owners, by insinuative argument, that shade is almost as necessary to the well-being of the brute creatures as food. Yet, notwithstanding that demonstration from the unerring course of nature, throughout all our islands (except in a very few instances), these poor creatures are exposed to the scorching sun-beams without mercy. Such inhuman neglect is not always so much the effect of inattention as of a mistaken notion that shades are impedimental to the making of much dung; but a flat shed, covered with cane-trash, may be so made as to let rain pass through it without admission of sun-beams. This will do for cattle; but mules, which are spirited creatures, and work themselves by draught into a foaming heat, should be put into a warm stable, until quite cool; for turning them loose to pasture when too hot, is probably the cause of their destruction by the glanders.\n\nIf the care of providing shade for brute creatures is so much the duty and interest of their owners, how much more is it agreeable to the laws of humanity to provide shade for human creatures travelling upon the high-roads in this hot climate? Nothing surely of so much beauty costs so little expense as planting cocoanut or spreading timber trees in avenues along the highways, if each proprietor of the lands adjoining hath any taste of elegance, or feeling for other men: but both those kinds of trees will yield also great profit to the proprietor, by furnishing him with timber, when perhaps not otherwise to be had; or with a delicious milk, fitted by nature to cool the effervescence of the blood in this hot region; and also to improve the spirits made from sugar to the delicacy and softness of arrack. Cocoanut and cabbage-trees are both very beautiful and shady, bearing round heads of great expansion, upon natural trunks or pillars of elegant proportion, and of such an height as to furnish a large shade, with a free circulation of air equally refreshing to man and beast.\n\nThe common objection of injury to canes by the roots of such trees growing on their borders, may be easily removed by digging a small trench between the canes and trees, which may intercept their roots, and oblige them to seek sustenance in the common road. Let it also be considered, besides the benefits above suggested, that the planter will thus beautify his estate to the resemblance of a most sumptuous garden. And probably that very beauty might not only render the islands more healthful to the inhabitants, by preserving them from fevers kindled by the burning sun-beams, but also much more fruitful by making the weather more seasonable: for as, by cutting down all its woods, an hot country becomes more subject to excessive droughts; so, by replanting it in the manner above described, this inconvenience would probably be prevented.\n\nLet then the planter be kind not only to his fellow-creatures but merciful to his beasts; giving them plenty and variety of wholesome food, clear water, cool shade, and a clean bed, bleeding them after a long course of hard labour, currying their hides from filth and ticks (A); affording them salt and other physic when necessary; protecting them from the flaying rope-lashes of a cruel driver (who needs no other instrument than a goad); proportioning their labour to their strength; and by every art rendering their work as easy as possible. The general management of planters is not, perhaps, more defective in any other respect than in this: for, by pairing the cattle unequally, and by the drivers ill conduct in writhing to the right and left, the poor creatures are fatigued by much needless labour. A horse ought therefore to be harnessed before them as a leader. This docile creature, by being led in a straight line, will soon learn to be an unerring guide, and the cattle will follow in the same direction with united strength, and consequently with more effect and less fatigue to each individual.\n\nThe Portuguese of Madeira, by their poverty and scantiness of pasture, breed the smallest kind of cattle; and yet one yoke of them will draw a much greater weight than a pair of our largest oxen, solely by an equal exertion of their joint strength. That equality or evenness of draught is preserved by boring gamblet holes through their horns, within two inches of the points, and running a thong of leather through those holes, so as to tie the horns of each pair at six inches distance from each other. By this ligature the pair of cattle are absolutely hindered from turning different ways, and draw in an even direction with united force. Thus it appears evidently from reason, as well as from experience, that the labour of our beasts may, by a little contrivance, be rendered more easy and effectual.\n\nOf the Culture of various Soils.] In the British sugar-colonies there is as great a variety of soils as in any country of Europe; some naturally very rich or fruitful, yielding a luxuriant product with little labour or culture. This fruitful soil is of three kinds: a loose hazel mould mixed with sand, like that of St. Christopher's, and is the best in the known world for producing sugar in great quantity, and of the best quality. The brick mould of Jamaica is somewhat of the same nature, and next in value; and then the various mixtures of mould and gravel, to be found in veins or plats over all the other islands. When any of these soils are exhausted of their fertility by long and injudicious culture, they may be restored by any kind of dung well rotted; for these (B) warm soils cannot bear hot unrotten dung, without being laid fallow for a considerable time after it. Another improvement is by sea-fan or sea-weed; or by digging in the cane-trash into steep lands, and by letting it lie to rot for some months. A third method is, by ploughing and laying it fallow; and the fourth method (the best of all), is by folding the fallows by sheep. But this can be practised only where there are extensive pastures; nor can the plough be employed where the soil abounds with large stones. In that case, however, the former method of digging in\n\n---\n\n(A) One pound of native sulphur, a quart of lamp-oil, and the like quantity of hog's-lard, intimately mixed and made into an ointment, is a cure for the mange, lice, &c.\n\n(B) These soils, which are naturally loose and upon marle, Mr Martin calls hot soils; and these, he says, have been much injured in some of the islands by dung hastily made with marle: but if the sediment of lees were thrown into these pens, after being turned over, it would much improve the dung.\ntraffic will be nearly as effectual, though more expensive, by hand-labour or hoe-ploughing.\n\nThe next best soil for producing good sugar is a mould upon clay, which if shallow requires much culture and good labour, or its produce will be small in quantity, though of a strong grain and bright colour, so as to yield most profit to the refiner of any sugar, except that produced from an hazel or gravelly soil, as before-mentioned. All the black mould soils upon marle are generally fruitful, and will take any kind of dung; but yield not so strong or large-grained sugar. Marle, however, of a white, yellow, or blue colour, or rich mould from washes, or allies of every kind, are excellent for every strong soil, as the chief ingredient in the compost of dung: either of them will do alone for stiff lands; but the yellow and chocolate marle are the most foamy, and the richest kind of manure (except fine mould) for all stiff lands. If these are well opened, pulverized by culture, and mixed with hot dung, or any kind of loamy earth or marle, they will produce as plentifully as lighter soils; and all kinds of clay-soils, except that of a white colour, have these two advantages above the finest gravel soils, that they do not forch soon by dry weather, and never grow weary of the same manure, as most other soils do.\n\nThe extraordinary hard-labour bestowed in making dung, may be saved by the art of caving, now in general use in England. Ten mules or horses, and two light tumbrils with broad wheels, and ten able negroes, may, by the common use of spades, shovels, and light mattocks or grubbing hoes, make more dung than 60 able negroes can do in the present methods.\n\nIf marle lies upon rising grounds, or in hillocks, as it often does, the pit is to be opened at the foot of the declivity; which being dug inwards, till the bank is three feet high, then it is to be caved thus. Dig an hollow space of 12 or 18 inches deep under the foot of the bank; then dig into each side of it another perpendicular cut of the same depth, and 18 inches wide from the top of the bank to the bottom: that being finished, make a final trench a foot or two from the brink of the bank; pour into it water till full; and when that is done, fill it again, till the water soaking downward makes the marle separate and fall down all at once. This may be repeated till the pit rises to 50 feet high; and then many hundreds of cart-loads of marle may be thrown down by four negroes in two hours; from whence it may be carted into cattle-pens, or laid out upon lands, as occasion requires. Five or six negroes with spades or shovels will keep two or three tumbrils employed, according to the distance of carriage: and thus as much dung may be made by ten negro men as will dung richly at least 70 or 80 acres of land every year, and laid out also with the affluence of cattle-carts: An improvement highly worthy every planter's consideration, when negroes and feeding them are so expensive; and this is no speculation, but has been confirmed by practice. In level lands, the same operation may be as effectual, provided the mouth of the pit be opened by gradual descent to any depth: but when marle is to be found on the sides of hills, the operation is less laborious for the horses. But if the surface of the marle-pits (as it often happens) be covered with clay or stiff soil, so that the water cannot quickly soak from the trench above; in that case, pieces of hard wood, made like piles, four feet long, and four inches square, pointed at one end, and secured at the other square head by an iron clamp, may be driven by heavy mauls into the trench, as so many wedges, which will make the caved part tumble down: but a skilful eye must watch the last operation, or the labourers may be buried or hurt.\n\nBut then clay soils that are level, and subject to be drowned, or to retain water in stagnated pools, can never be made fruitful by any kind of manure, without being first well drained: for water lying upon any soil will most certainly transform it to a stiff unfruitful clay; as appears evidently by the bogs of Ireland, the fens of Lincoln and Cambridgeshire, and even by the ponds of Barbadoes situated in the deepest and lightest black mould; for that fine soil being walked into those ponds, becomes the stiffest black clay, not fit even for an ingredient in dung, until it has been laid dry, and exposed to the sun for a whole year: but when these bogs and fens are well drained, they become the most fruitful soils. Natural clay the celebrated Boerhaave thinks the fattest of all soils; but then it must be opened by culture, marle, or sandy manures. It is hard to conjecture how the opinion prevailed in the British plantations, that sandy gut-mould was most unfit for clay-soils, as being the means of binding them to the compactness of brick; whereas it is proved, from long experience, to be one of the best means of opening clay soils, and rendering them abundantly fruitful. Brick is made of clay alone; no sand being used in it, farther than to sprinkle the board, on which it is moulded into shape. From repeated experience it appears, that a mixture of sand in gut-mould is the best of all manure for stiff and barren clay-lands; provided they be well drained, by throwing the whole soil into round ridges of 12 feet wide, with furrows of three feet wide between each ridge. And this is done with little more hand-labour than that of hoe-ploughing well in the common way. For if a piece of land be marked in lines at seven feet and a half distance from each other, and the labourers are set in to hoe-plough at the second line, hauling back each clod 12 inches; half the ridge, and near half the furrow, is made at the same time: and thus a piece of land may be round-ridged, and the furrows all made at once, by the common operation of hoe-ploughing, provided the digger drives his hoe up to the eye at every stroke. Hoe-ploughing in clay soils that have lain long under water, is indeed hard labour; but it will every year grow the lighter by being well drained by round-ridging: and in the meanwhile the labour may be rendered much more easy by the plough conducted by the lines above described. As therefore sandy mould is the best manure for stiff clay, so, by parity of reason, confirmed by long experience, stiff clay is the best manure for sandy or chaffy soils.\n\nThe method of round-ridging before described, is, by several years experience, found the most essential improvement of flat clayey soils: and yet there are some who will prefer speculation to ocular demonstration, fancying that all kinds of ridges will carry off the mould in heavy rains. The fact is otherwise in clay soils: and plain reason, without experience, vouches, that where great confluences of water are divided into many small rills, the force is broken; and therefore less mould carried off the land. Another objection made to round-riding is, that by digging much clay to form the sides of\nthe ridge, the soil is impoverished; but this objection stands good only against those ridges which are raised too high, and made too broad; but if land is ridged in the manner before directed, that is, 12 feet broad, and not above six or eight inches higher in the middle than at the sides, the objection vanishes. Ridges were never propounded for light soils or steep lands; and even in flat soils upon loam they should be made with great caution, because loam melts away by water. But there are poachy lands of a white clay, even upon small declivities, too retentive of water; these may certainly be improved much by ridges of 12 feet wide, as above described, without fear of wastes.\n\nBut supposing, as the objection urges, that a little clay should be turned up at the sides of such ridges, can it not be manured somewhat more than the other parts with marl or sandy mould, so as to become equally good with any other part of the soil? And is not this well worth the labour, since round ridging not only improves the soil by draining it to a surprising degree, but adds one-fifth part to the depth of the staple? And will not a ridge make a little rounding, throw off the water much better than a flat ridge?\n\nThe general maxim of not burning cane-trash (which may be called the flubble of cane-lands) upon any kind of soil, is surely a great mistake; as may be evinced by observing the contrary practice of the best husbandmen in England, where burn-baiting or bastard burn-baiting, is found by experience an admirable method of fertilizing cold, stiff, or clayey lands. It must indeed be a constant practice, not only for the sake of contributing to warm and divide the soil, but as the only effectual means of destroying pernicious insects, and weeds of various kinds, such as French weed, wild peafe, and wild vines.\n\nSoon after the disuse of burning trash upon our lands in the islands, the blast made its first appearance with incredible devastation; to revive that practice therefore seems to be the most obvious means of expelling it. It may be presumed that the disuse of burning trash was founded upon the mistaken notion of burn-baiting, which is turning up a thick sod of very dry, tight, and shallow soils, and burning the whole superfluities or staple to ashes. This practice the writers upon husbandry condemn universally, and very justly: for though by this practice the land will produce two or three crops more plentifully than ever, yet the soil is blown away by the wind, and the subsoil being generally an hungry gravel or chalk, can never be restored to fertility by the common arts of husbandry. But surely this has no resemblance to our superficial burning of the little trash we can spare from dung: and though this method of burn-baiting light and shallow soils be justly condemned, yet the best writers recommend that very practice in cold, moist, and heavy soils, as is observed above; and long experience justifies it.\n\nDeep mould upon clay or loam being subject to the grub-worm (c), will not take any kind of dung, till perfectly rotten, except that of the sheep-fold; which is the best manure for all kinds of light soils, and is of Plantership all others the least expensive, as not requiring hand-labour. But the use of the fold is impracticable in any island not abounding with large savannas or sheep-pastures, as in Jamaica.\n\nThose soils therefore which are subject to the grub, and must be fertilized by common dung, which is a proper nest for the mother-beetle to deposit its eggs, must be well impregnated with the brine of dissolved salt, after the dung is first cut up; two large hogheads of salt will make brine enough for a dung-pen of 50 feet square.\n\nThis cure for the grub is a late discovery; and which has been attended with success, so far as the experiment is made. But though it proves effectual to destroy that pernicious insect in plant-canes, it probably will not be sufficient to save ratoons, without a new application of salt in powder; because the first brine must be washed away by the time when ratoons spring up.\n\nThe planter who would save his ratoons from the grub ought therefore to cut off the heads of his stools with sharp hoes three inches below the surface of the soil, and then throw an handful of salt round each stool, and cover it up to a level with fine mould taken from the edges.\n\nIn soils where there is no grub, and the planter wishes to have very good ratoons, let him, as soon as his canes are cut, draw all the trash from the stools into the alternate spaces, if planted in that manner; or into the furrows, if his land be round-ridged; and then cut off the head of his stools with sharp hoes, as above directed. Experience has shown the advantage of this practice, and reason demonstrates the great benefit of the ratoon-sprouts rising from three inches below the surface, instead of superficial shoots which come to nothing, and only starve the strong sprouts. Besides, the stubs which are left upon the stools after the canes are cut, canker, and rot the stools; which is one reason why good ratoons are uncommon in soils long cultivated. Yet it is the opinion of some, that by hoe-ploughing and even duning ratoons, the produce might be as good plant-canes, which would save the labour of boiling and planting so often as planters commonly do.\n\nFallowing is of incredible advantage to every soil, not only by being divided into the minutest parts, but also by imbibing those vegetative powers with which the air is impregnated by the bountiful hand of Providence, whenever rain falls. What those powers are has been explained under the articles Agriculture and Plant; and experience evinces, that the tender vegetables of the earth are invigorated more by the smallest shower of rain, than by all the water which human art can bestow. Let it therefore be a constant maxim of the planter, never to plant his ground until the soil is well mellowed by fallowing, even though he bestows upon it a due proportion of dung; we say a due proportion; for too much will force up rank canes, which never yield good sugar; and though some advantage may be reaped from the ratoons,\n\n(c) This pernicious insect is most apt to engender in dung made from mill-trash, which therefore never ought to be put into dung-compost or still-ponds; but after being burnt, the ashes will be as good as any other kind. Round-ridging, with manure of unwept ashes, pea-fan, or lime, or dry marl, kills the grub.\ntoons, yet it will be found by experience not to compensate the loss by the plants. In flaky or steep soils, where the plough cannot be used, or where a sufficient strength of cattle cannot be supported for that purpose, hand-labour or hoe-ploughing must be substituted; but even in that case, much labour may be saved by spreading the dung according to the English husbandry, and digging it into the soil. To evince this truth, let any planter compute his negroes' labour of distributing dung by baskets, and by spreading it with dung-forks; and then judge for himself by one single experiment which is the most profitable.\n\nBut if some planters are so devoted to the old custom of distributing dung by baskets instead of wheelbarrows in level ground, or hand-baskets in uneven land, by which three times the labour may be accomplished in the same time and by the same hands; let them at least save much of their hand-labour, by the following method of laying out dung, before the distribution by baskets.\n\nIn holing a piece of land, let a space be left after 80 holes from the first interval, and then the like space after 80 holes throughout the whole plat, which spaces must run exactly parallel to the intervals on the right and left of the holes. Into these spaces the dung may be carted, even before it be rotten (D), at the most leisure times, and covered with mould or cane-trail, to prevent exhalation; and in such quantity as will suffice only to dung a row of 40 holes, from the point opposite to each side of it. In the intervals at each side of the cane-piece, which are parallel to those spaces, there must be dung enough carted to manure a row of 40 holes, and covered in like manner.\n\nBy thus placing the dung or gut-mould, it is evident at the first sight, that the farthest distance cannot be above 40 holes in distributing the dung; and in case it be not sufficiently rotten for present use, it may be distributed even in dry weather, and covered by the bank; which will both prevent its spirit from exhalation, and occasion it to rot sooner, which is no small advantage. Moreover, by being thus laid out at the most leisure times, and covered with the banks, the dung will be more intimately mixed with the soil, and therefore continue to nourish the plant for a longer time than if laid as usual at the bottom of the holes. A farther advantage of thus distributing the dung, and covering it, results from the more expeditious planting the land after a short or sudden shower: for the labour of covering the dung, and uncovering it when the land is planted, however it may appear in speculation, is in practice a trifle; and besides all the other advantages arising by the distribution of dung from the spaces above described, this is not the least, that not a bank is trodden under foot. But it is evident, that by distributing the dung with baskets in the present method, the soil is much trampled under foot; and by that means, the very end of hoe-ploughing, or loosening the soil, is much defeated. In like manner, by the present method of hoe-ploughing, the same ill effect is produced; for as the negroes hoe-plough or dig the soil directly forward, so they must necessarily tread the ground as fast as they dig it; whereas by putting the labourers to dig sidewise, no one puts a foot upon the soil after it is dug; and by lining the land before it is hoe-ploughed, each negro may have an equal share to dig. The only difficulty of hoe-ploughing sidewise is in first setting the negroes to that work; but it may be done without loss of time when working in a contiguous field. Whether hoe-ploughing before or after the land be holed for canes is most eligible, experience must determine; but certainly both operations will be most effectual: and therefore it will be advisable (E), first to plough the soil where the land will admit the plough; and where it will not, to hoe-plough it with or without dung, as requisite; then let it lie fallow till perfectly mellowed; then hole and plant it; and instead of weeding in the usual manner, let the weeds in all the spaces be dug into the soil: but as this is not to be done so well with the hoe, it is submitted to future experience, whether the dexterous use of spades, as in England, will not answer the purpose much better, and with equal dispatch. But whatever method is preferred, most certain it is, that by loosening the soil in all the spaces between the young canes after being come up, their fibres will more easily expand on every side, and acquire more nutrition to invigorate their growth. But where the planter grudges this labour, by thinking it needless in a rich loose soil, he may dispatch more weeding-work by the Dutch hoe than by any other; which being fastened upon the end of a stick, is pushed forward under the roots of the small weeds, in such a manner as to cut them up a little below the surface of the soil, and will do more execution at one stroke than can be done at three strokes of the common hoe: but there is yet another practice of the horse-hoe plough, whereby all weeds growing in rows between beans and peas, are extirpated with incredible ease and expedition. It is a very simple machine, drawn by one or two horses, consisting of a pair of low wheels turning upon a common axis; from whence two square irons are let down at equal distances, and triangular hoes made at the ends, the points of the triangles being placed forward, and so fixed as to cut all weeds an inch below the surface, in the same manner as the Dutch garden-hoe above-mentioned. By this machine a man and a boy, with two horses or mules, will clear perfectly all the spaces of a field of ten acres in two days, and may be of admirable use in all loose and dry soils in the sugar-lands: for while two horses or mules draw in the space before each other, the wheels pass on the outside of each row of canes, without doing the least injury, while the\n\n(D) In order to make dung rot the sooner, much labour is bestowed in digging and turning it over by hoes: but two-thirds of that labour may be saved by the use of hay-knives; six of which, used dexterously, will cut up a pen in less time than 60 negroes can do by hoes: but hay-knives cannot be used where gritty mould is employed in pens.\n\n(E) Deep and loose soils may be ploughed with a small strength of cattle or mules: but stiff lands in hot climates require more strength of cattle than can be maintained in the small pastures of the planters; for if those strong soils are either too wet or too dry (as is generally the case), ploughing is impracticable.\nplough-holder attends to his business. In stiff soils which require draining, neither the horse-hoe plough nor the Dutch hoe can be proper; or any other instrument so effectual as the spade used in the manner above hinted, where the flake is deep.\n\nBut where the flake of land is shallow, care must be taken not to dig much below it, according to the universal opinion of all the best writers, supported by the experience of 100 years. Yet some good planters are fallen into the contrary practice, and dig up stiff clay far below the flake. This, Mr Martin says, was done in his own lands, during his absence, by injudiciously ploughing below the flake; and so injured the foil, that all the arts of culture for many years hardly retrieved its former fertility. Indeed, where the flake is shallow, upon a fat clay, the turning up a little of it at a time, from the bottom of the cane-holes, and mixing it with rich hot dung, made of marle, or sandy mould, which may take off its cohesive quality, will in due time, and by long fallow, convert it into good soil; but if stiff clay be turned up, without any such mixture, in large quantities, it will infallibly disappoint the operator's hopes: for though solid clay will moulder, by exposure, to a seeming fine earth, yet it will return to its primitive state very soon after being wet, and covered from the external air, if not divided, as above suggested.\n\nAfter all, the common horse-hoeing plough drawn by two mules in a line before each other, or the hand-hoe in common use, will answer the purpose very well, where the lands are planted in Mr Tull's method; that is, where the spaces are equal to the land planted, in the following manner.\n\nSuppose six feet planted in two rows of canes, and fix feet of land left as a space unplanted; and so a whole piece of land, planted in alternate double rows (r), with equal spaces, may be hoe-ploughed with ease, as before hinted; and that at any time during the growth of canes, when it is most convenient to the planter, which is a considerable advantage; and yet it is the least of all attending this method of culture: for, by leaving these spaces, the canes will have both more air and sun; by hoe-ploughing them, the roots of each double row will have large room for expansion, and consequently, by gaining more nutriment, will grow more luxuriantly: by these spaces the canes may be cleaned from the blast with much more ease and convenience: and will serve as proper beds to plant great corn, without the least injury to the canes; as well as to contain the trash taken off the land, where, by rotting, and being hoe-ploughed into the soil, it will wonderfully enrich it, and will fit it to be planted immediately after the canes in the neighbouring double rows are cut down. Besides all these admirable advantages of planting the land in alternate double rows with equal spaces, the canes, when at full age, may be easily stripped of their trash, and by that means the juice rendered so mature as to yield double the produce, and much better sugars than unstriped canes. This method of culture may be recommended for all kinds of soil: for as by this practice the rank luxuriant canes will be more matured, so the poor soils will be rendered more fruitful; and as the roots of the canes which expand into these spaces will be kept moist by being covered with rotten trash, so they must bear dry weather much longer in the burning soils. In those low lands which require draining by furrows, the alternate double rows and spaces must be made across the ridges; by which means those spaces, being hoe-ploughed from the centre to the sides, will always preserve in a proper state of roundness. By this method of planting, the canes may be so well ripened as to yield double the quantity of sugar of canes planted in the close manner; which saves half the labour of cartage, half the time of grinding and boiling, and half the fuel, besides yielding finer sugar.\n\nYet, how well forever the method of planting in single or double alternate rows has succeeded in the loose and stiff soils, experience has shown that it is a wrong practice in stiff lands that are thrown into round or flat ridges: for these being most apt to crack, the sun-beams penetrate soon to the cane-roots, stop their growth, and have an ill influence upon the sugar. It is therefore advisable to plant such lands full, but in large holes, of 4 feet, by 5 feet towards the banks: after the plant-canies are cut, to dig out one, and leave two rows standing, hoe-ploughing the spaces after turning all the trash into furrows till almost rotten: for if the trash is drawn upon the hoe-ploughed spaces, they will hardly ever moulder, at least not till the trash is quite rotten. This is an infallible proof from experience of how little advantage trash is to the soil, unless it be in great droughts, to keep out the intense sun-beams: for, in all other respects, it prevents that joint operation of the sun and air in mouldering and fruitifying the soil, as has been proved by repeated experiments.\n\nBut in flat stiff soils that are properly drained by round-ridging, no culture prevents cracking so effectually as hoe-ploughing into them a quantity of loose marle, of which that of a chocolate or of a yellow colour is best; and it will be still much better, by lying upon the land, in small heaps, or in cane-holes, for some time, to imbibe the vegetative powers of the air before it is intimately mixed with the soil.\n\nAs to the manner of planting canes, the general practice of allowing four feet by five to an hole, and two fresh (c) plants, is found by common experience to be right and good in alternate rows. But the following precautions are necessary to be observed. First, let all the cane-rows run east and west, that the trade-wind may pass freely through them; because air and sunshine are as conducive to the growth and maturation of sugar-canes as of any other vegetable. Secondly, let not any accretion of mould be drawn into hills round the young canes, except where water stagnates (h); because the fibres which run horizontally, and near the surface, are much\n\n(f) In stiff lands, the single alternate rows of four feet distance, as preventive of much labour in weeding, are found best; and also yield more sugar by the acre; and are less apt to be affected by drought.\n\n(g) It is an odd fancy that stale plants grow best; when both reason and experience vouch that the most succulent plants are best: one good plant in the centre of a large hole is sufficient when the land is full holed.\n\n(h) The stagnation of water in pools (usual in stiff level lands) is the most injurious circumstance attending it; for\nmuch broken and spoiled by that practice. Thirdly, let the sugar-canes be cut at their full maturity; which, in a dry loofe soil, is generally at the end of 14 or 15 months after being planted; but in cold clay-foils, not till 16 or 17 months. Fourthly, as the cane-rows run east and west in as proper a direction as possible for cartage to the sugar work, so canes must be cut the contrary way if the planter expects any great produce from his ratoons: for by beginning to cut canes at the part of his field most remote from the works, the carts cannot often pass over the same tract, and consequently the cane-stools cannot be injured, more especially if he takes due care to cut the canes very close to their roots; for, by leaving a long stub (which must perish) the cane-stools are much injured. It may be objected to the practice of cutting canes transversely to the rows, that the negroes labour will not be so equally divided: but let every man consider both sides of the question, and be determined by his own experience; and then he will be convinced, that it matters very little which way he cuts straight standing canes; but in cases where the sugar-canes lean, or are lodged by preceding high winds, it is a point of great importance to place the labourers so as to cut the canes first at the roots, and then, drawing them, cut off the tops: for thus by two strokes each cane will be cut; and twice the quantity cut in the same time, and by the same hands, more than by cutting in any other direction. In round-ridged land, it is proper to cut canes in the same direction of the ridges, throwing the tops and trash into the furrows to render the cartage easy, and to preserve the ridges in their proper form.\n\nIt is almost needless to suggest the expediency of planning the cane-pieces of a plantation in exact squares, so that the intervals may intersect at right angles; since such regularity is not only more beautiful, more safe in case of accidental fires, and a better disposition of the whole for dividing and planting one third or fourth part of a plantation every year, but also much easier guarded by a few watchmen: for one of these walking in a line from east to west, and the other from north to south, look through every avenue, where the most subtle thief cannot escape the watchful eye. And if the intervals surrounding the boundary of a regular plantation be made 24 feet wide, the proprietor will receive ample recompense for so much land, by the security of his canes from fires kindled in the neighbourhood, and by planting all that land in plantain-trees, which may at once yield food and shade to the watchmen, who by that means can have no excuse for absence from their proper stations. But as fuel grows very scarce in most of our islands, it is also expedient to plant a logwood or flower-fence in all the boundaries of every plantation, which, being cut every year, will furnish good store of faggots. Logwood makes the strongest and quickest of all fences, and agrees with every soil: the cuttings make excellent oven-fuel.\n\nSo much for the general operations of plantership, according to the approved directions of Mr Martin.

It stood far in the land, on a bay or arm of the sea; had two very safe harbours, the one called Lampter, the other Nauflatmos, (Livy). It was a colony of Ionians, situated in the territory of A\u00ebolis, (Herodotus). Massilia in Gaul was again a colony from it. Phocaenae, the people, (Livy); Phocaicus, the epithet, (Lucan); applied to Marcellus. It was one of the 12 cities which assembled in the panionium or general council of Ionia.\n\nSome writers tell us, that while the foundations of this city were laying, there appeared near the flore a great flood of sea-calves; whence it was called Ph\u0153cea, the word ph\u0153ce signifying in Greek a sea-calf. Ptolemy, who makes the river Hermus the boundary between A\u00ebolia and Ionia, places Ph\u0153cea in A\u00ebolis; but all other geographers reckon it among the cities of Ionia. It stood on the sea-coast, between Cuma to the north, and Smyrna to the south, not far from the Hermus; and was, in former times, one of the most wealthy and powerful cities of all Asia; but is now a poor beggarly village, though the see of a bishop. The Ph\u0153ceans were expert mariners, and the first among the Greeks that undertook long voyages; which they performed in galleys of fifty oars. As they applied themselves to trade and navigation, they became acquainted pretty early with the coasts and islands of Europe, where they are said to have founded several cities, namely, Velia in Italy; Alalia, or rather Aleria, in Corica; and Marcellis in Gaul. Neither were they unacquainted with Spain; for Herodotus tells us, that in the time of Cyrus the Great, the Ph\u0153ceans arriving at Sartellus, a city in the bay of Cadiz, were treated with extraordinary kindness by Arganthonius king of that country; who, hearing that they were under no small apprehension of the growing power of Cyrus, invited them to leave Ionia, and settle in what part of his kingdom they pleased. The Ph\u0153ceans could not be prevailed upon to forsake their country; but accepted a large sum of money, which that prince generously presented them with, to defray the expense of building a strong wall round their city. The wall they built on their return; but it was unable to resist the mighty power of Cyrus, whose general Harpagus, investing the city with a numerous army, soon reduced it to the utmost extremities. The Ph\u0153ceans, having no hopes of any succour, offered to capitulate; but the conditions offered by Harpagus seeming severe, they begged he would allow them three days to deliberate; and in the mean time, withdraw his forces. Harpagus, though not ignorant of their design, complied with their request. The Ph\u0153ceans, taking advantage of this concession, put their wives, children, and all their most valuable effects, on board several vessels which they had ready equipped, and conveyed them safe to the island of Chios, leaving the Persians in possession of empty houses. Their design was to purchase the Oeneian islands, which belonged to the Chians, and settle there. But the Chians not caring to have them so near, left they should enrol all the trade to themselves, as they were a seafaring people, they put to sea again; and, having taken Ph\u0153cea, their native country, by surprize, put all the Persians they found in it to the sword. They went to Corica; great part of them however returned very soon, as did the rest also in a few years. They then lived in subjection either to the Persians, or tyrants of their own. Among the latter we find mention made of Laodamus, who attended Darius Hydaspes in his expedition against the Scythians; and of Dionysius, who, joining Ariarathes, tyrant of Miletus, and chief author of the Ionian rebellion, retired, after the defeat of his countrymen, to Ph\u0153cia, where he made an immense booty, seizing on all the ships he met with trading to that country. From Ph\u0153cia he sailed to Sicily, where he committed great depredations on the Carthaginians and Tuscans; but is said never to have molested the Greeks.\n\nIn the Roman times the city of Ph\u0153cea sided with Antiochus.\nAntiochus the Great; whereupon it was besieged, taken, and plundered, by the Roman general; but allowed to be governed by its own laws. In the war which Artilonius brother to Attalus, king of Pergamus, raised against the Romans, they afflicted the former to the utmost of their power; a circumstance which so dispirited the senate, that they commanded the town to be demolished, and the whole race of the Phocaens to be utterly rooted out. This severe sentence would have been put in execution, had not the Maffilenses, a Phocaean colony, interposed, and, with much difficulty, assuaged the anger of the senate. Pompey declared Phoc\u00e6a a free city, and restored the inhabitants to all the privileges they had ever enjoyed; whence, under the first emperors, it was reckoned one of the most flourishing cities of all Asia Minor. This is all we have been able to collect from the ancients touching the particular history of Phoc\u00e6a.","sp":7,"ep":8},{"h":"PHOCAS","t":"a Roman centurion, was raised to the dignity of emperor by the army, and was crowned at Constantinople about the year 653. The emperor Mauritius, who was thus deserted both by the army and the people, fled to Chalcedon with his five children, whom Phocas caused to be inhumanly murdered before his eyes, and then he murdered Mauritius himself, his brother, and several other persons who were attached to that family.\n\nPhocas, thus proclaimed and acknowledged at Constantinople, sent, according to custom, his own image and that of his wife Leontia to Rome, where they were received with loud acclamations, the people there being incensed against Mauritius on account of the cruel exactions of the exarchs, and his other ministers in Italy. Gregory, surnamed the Great, then bishop of Rome, vaunted the images to be lodged in the oratory of the martyr Caesarius, and wrote letters to the new emperor, congratulating him upon his advancement to the throne, which he said was effected by a particular providence, to deliver the people from the innumerable calamities and heavy oppressions under which they had long groaned. Had we no other character of Phocas and Leontia but that which has been conveyed to us in Gregory's letters, we should rank him amongst the best princes mentioned in history; but all other writers paint him in quite different colours; and his actions, transmitted to us by several historians, evidently speak him a most cruel and blood-thirsty tyrant. He was of middling stature, says Cedrenus, deformed, and of a terrible aspect: his hair was red, his eye-brows met, and one of his cheeks was marked with a scar, which, when he was in a passion, grew black and frightful: he was greatly addicted to wine and women, blood-thirsty, inexorable, bold in speech, a stranger to compassion, in his principles a heretic. He endeavoured, in the beginning of his reign, to gain the affections of the people by celebrating the Circenian games with extraordinary pomp, and distributing on that occasion large sums among the people; but finding that instead of applauding they reviled him as a drunkard, he ordered his guards to fall upon them. Some were killed, many wounded, and great numbers were dragged to prison: but the populace rising, set them at liberty, and thenceforth conceived an irreconcileable aversion to the tyrant.\n\nAs soon as the death of Mauritius was known, Narzes, who then commanded the troops quartered on the frontiers of Persia, revolted. Phocas, however, managed matters so as to gain him over to his interest, and then treacherously and cruelly burnt him alive. He endeavoured to strengthen his cause by respectable alliances; but his cruelty was such as to render him generally hated, for he spared neither sex nor age, and amongst others he murdered Constantina the widow of Mauritius, and her daughters. These cruelties were at length the cause of his downfall. He became universally hateful; and persons in great authority near his person conspired against him. This conspiracy, however, was discovered, and the persons concerned in it were all put to death. The following year, however, 618, he was overtaken by the fate he had so long deserved.\n\nHeraclius, the son of the governor of Africa, who bore the same name, taking upon him the title of emperor, and being acknowledged as such by the people of Africa, sailed from thence with a formidable fleet, and a powerful army on board, for Constantinople, while Nicetas marched thither by way of Alexandria and the Pentapolis. Heraclius steered his course to Abydus, where he was received with great demonstrations of joy by several persons of rank, who had been banished by Phocas. From Abydus he sailed to Constantinople, where he engaged and utterly defeated the tyrant's fleet. Phocas took refuge in the palace; but one Photinus, whose wife he had formerly debauched, pursuing him with a party of soldiers, forced the gates, dragged the cowardly emperor from the throne, and having stripped him of the imperial robes, and clothed him with a black vest, carried him in chains to Heraclius, who commanded first his hands and feet, then his arms, and at last his head, to be cut off: the remaining part of his body was delivered up to the soldiers, who burnt it in the forum. We are told, that Heraclius having reproached him with his evil administration, he answered, with great calmness, \"It is incumbent upon you to govern better.\" Such was the end of this cruel tyrant, after he had reigned seven years and some months.","sp":8,"ep":8},{"h":"PHOCILIDES","t":"a Greek poet and philosopher of Miletus, flourished about 540 years before the Christian era. The poetical piece now extant, attributed to him, is not of his composition, but of another poet who lived in the reign of Adrian.\n\nPHOCION was a distinguished Athenian general and orator in the time of Philip II. of Macedon. His character is thus described in the Ancient Universal History. \"He was too modest to solicit command, nor did he promote wars that he might raise his authority by them; though, taken either as a soldier, orator, statesman, or general, he was by far the most eminent Athenian of his time. As he was a most disinterested patriot, he could entertain no great affection for Philip: but as he perfectly well knew the disposition of his countrymen, and how unlikely they were long to support such measures as were necessary to humble the Macedonian power, he did not express himself vehemently, but chose rather to cultivate the esteem which on all occasions Philip showed for the state of Athens, as a mean of preserving her, when she should be reduced to that situation which he conceived they wanted virtue to prevent. From this character the reader will easily discern that Demosthenes\nDemosthenes and he could not well agree. The former was always warm, his language copious, and his designs extensive; and Phocion, on the other hand, was of a mild temper, delivered his opinion in very few words, and propounded schemes at once necessary and easy to be effected. Yet he seldom or never concurred with the people, but spoke so poignantly against their vices as Demosthenes himself; inasmuch that this orator once told him, 'The Athenians, Phocion, in some of their mad fits, will murder thee.' 'The same (answered he) may fall to thee, Demosthenes, if ever they come to be sober.'\n\nHe was afterwards appointed to command the army which was sent to assist the Byzantines against Philip, whom he obliged to return to his own dominions. This truly great man, whom (though extremely poor) no sum could bribe to betray his country, and who at every risk on all occasions gave them sound advice, was at length accused by his ungrateful countrymen. This event happened in the year before Christ 318. He was sent to Athens by Polyperchon head of a faction in Macedonia, together with his friends, chained in carts, with this message, \"That though he was convinced they were traitors, yet he left them to be judged by the Athenians as a free people.\" Phocion demanded whether they intended to proceed against him by form of law; and some crying out that they would, Phocion demanded how that could be if they were not allowed a fair hearing: but perceiving, by the clamour of the people, that no such thing was to be expected, he exclaimed, \"As for myself, I confess the crime objected to me, and submit to the judgement of the law; but consider, O ye Athenians, what have these poor innocent men done that they should be involved in the same calamity with me?\" The people replied with great vociferation, \"They are your accomplices, and that is enough.\" Then the decree was read, adjudging them all to death, viz. Phocion, Nicocles, Aedipidus, Agamorn, and Pythocles; these were present: Demetrius, Phalereus, Callimedon, Charicles, and others, were condemned in their absence. Some moved that Phocion might be tortured before he was put to death; nay, they were for bringing the rack into the assembly, and torturing him there. The majority, however, thought it enough if he was put to death, for which the decree was carried unanimously; some putting on garlands of flowers when they gave their votes. As he was going to execution, a person who was his intimate friend asked him if he had any message for his son? \"Yes,\" replied Phocion; \"tell him it is my last command that he forget how ill the Athenians treated his father.\"\n\nThe spleen of his enemies was not extinguished with his life: they passed a decree whereby his corpse was banished the Athenian territories; they likewise forbade any Athenians to furnish fire for his funeral pile. One Conopian took up the corpse, and carried it beyond Eleusina, where he borrowed some fire of a Megarian woman and burned it. A Megarian matron, who attended with her maid, raised on the place an honorary monument; and having gathered up the bones, carried them home, and buried them under her own hearth; praying at the same time thus to the Penates: \"To you, O ye gods, guardians of this place, I commit the precious remains of the most excellent Phocion. Protect them, I beseech you, from all insults; and deliver them one day to be reposed in the sepulchre of his ancestors, when the Athenians shall become wiser.\" It was not long before this opportunity occurred. When the Athenians began to cool a little, and remember the many services they had received from Phocion, they decreed him a statue of brass; ordered his bones to be brought back at the public expense; and decreed that his accusers should be put to death. Argyrides, who was principally concerned in that tragedy, suffered; but Epicurus and Demophilus, who were also accomplices in it, fled. However, Phocion's son met with them, and executed his revenge upon them; which was almost the only good action he ever performed, as he had a very small share of his father's abilities, and not any of his virtues. Such is the fickleness and such the injustice of popular governments; failings which, if we are to judge from universal experience, are absolutely inseparable from them.","sp":8,"ep":9},{"h":"PHOCIS","t":"(Demosthenes, Strabo, Pausanias); a country of Greece, contained between Boeotia to the east and Locris to the west, but extending formerly from the Sinus Corinthiacus on the south to the sea of Euboea on the north, and, according to Dionysius, as far as Thermopylae; but reduced afterwards to narrower bounds. Phoenicea, the people; Phociaca, the epithet, (Julius); Bellum Phocicum, the sacred war which the Thebans and Philip of Macedon carried on against them for plundering the temple at Delphi; and by which Philip paved the way to the sovereignty of all Greece, (Julius.) Its greatest length was from north to south, that is, from $38^\\circ 45'$ to $39^\\circ 20'$, or about 35 miles; but very narrow from east to west, not extending to 30 miles, that is, from $23^\\circ 15'$ to $23^\\circ 45'$ at the widest, but about 23 miles towards the Corinthian bay, and much narrower still towards the north. This country is generally allowed to have taken its name from Phocus the son of Ornytion, a native of Corinth; but having been soon after invaded by the Eginetae, under the conduct of another Phocus, who was the son of Eacus king of Enoplia, the memory of the first infallibly gave way to that of the second.\n\nIn Phocis there were many celebrated mountains, such as Cytharoon, Helicon, and Parnassus. The last two we have already noticed in the order of the alphabet. Cytharoon was consecrated to the muses as well as the other two, and was consequently much celebrated by the poets. Both it and Helicon contend with Mount Parnassus for height and magnitude. There were no remarkable rivers in Phocis except Cephissus, which runs from the foot of Parnassus northward, and empties itself in the Pindus, which was near the boundary of that kingdom. It had several very considerable cities; such as Cyrra, Griffa, and Anticyra, which, according to Ptolemy, were on the sea coasts; and Pythia, Delphi, Daulis, Elatia, Ergothemia, and Baulia, which were inland towns. Elatia was the largest and richest after Delphi.\n\nDeucalion was king of that part of Phocis which lies about Parnassus, at the time that Cecrops flourished in Attica; but the Phocians afterwards formed themselves into a commonwealth, to be governed by their general assemblies, the members of which were chosen from among themselves, and were changed as often as occasion required. Of the history of the Phocians but little is known till the time of the holy war, of which\nwe have the following account in the Ancient Universal History.\n\n\"The Phocians having presumed to plough the territories of the city of Cyrra, consecrated to the Delphic god, were summoned by the other Grecian states before the court of the Amphictyons, where a considerable fine was imposed upon them for their sacrilege. They refused to pay it, on pretence that it was too large; and at the next assembly their dominions were adjudged confiscated to the use of the temple. This second sentence exasperated the Phocians still more; who, at the instigation of one Philomelus, or, as he is called by Plutarch, Philomedes, seized upon the temple, plundered it of its treasure, and held the sacred depositum for a considerable time. This second crime occasioned another assembly of the Amphictyons, the result of which was a formal declaration of war against the Phocians. The quarrel being become more general, the several states took part in it according to their inclinations or interest. Athens, Sparta, and some others of the Peloponnesians, declared for the Phocians; and the Thebans, Thessalians, Locrians, and other neighbouring states, against them. A war was commenced with great fury on both sides, and styled the holy war, which lasted ten years; during which the Phocians, having hired a number of foreign troops, made an obstinate defence, and would in all probability have held out much longer had not Philip of Macedon given the finishing stroke to their total defeat and punishment. The war being ended, the grand council assembled again, and imposed an annual fine of 65 talents upon the Phocians, to be paid to the temple, and continued till they had fully repaired the damage it had sustained from them; and, till this reparation should be made, they were excluded from dwelling in walled towns, and from having any vote in the grand assembly. They did not, however, continue long under this heavy sentence: their known bravery made their alliance so necessary to the rest, that they were glad to remit it; after which remission they continued to behave with their usual courage and resolution, and soon obliterated their former guilt.\"\n\nWe cannot finish this article without mentioning more particularly Daulis, rendered famous, not so much for its extent or richness, as for the stature and prowess of its inhabitants; but still more for the inhuman repast which was served up to Tereus king of Thrace by the women of this city, by whom he was soon after murdered for the double injury he had done to his sister-in-law Philomela, daughter of Pandonion king of Athens.

See APOLLO.","sp":10,"ep":10},{"h":"PHOENICIA","t":"or more properly PHOENICE, the ancient name of a country lying between the 34th and 36th degrees of north latitude; bounded by Syria on Phoenicia, the north and east, by Judea on the south, and by the Mediterranean on the west. Whence it borrowed its name is not absolutely certain. Some derive it from Ancient one Phoenix; others from the Greek word phanix, fig-tree. Hyft. nifying a palm or date, as that tree remarkably abound ed in this country. Some again suppose that Phoenice is originally a translation of the Hebrew word Edom, from the Edomites who fled thither in the days of David. By the contraction of Canaan it was also called Chna, and anciently Rhabbothin and Colpis (A). The Jews commonly named it Canaan; though some part of it, at least, they knew by the name of Syrophoenice (B). Bochart tells us that the most probable etymology is Phene Anak, i.e., \"the descendants of Anak.\" Such were the names peculiar to this small country; though Phoenice was sometimes extended to all the maritime countries of Syria and Judea, and Canaan to the Philistines, and even to the Amalekites. On the contrary, these two names, and the rest, were most generally followed up by those of Palestine and Syria (C).\n\nThere is some disagreement among authors with respect to the northern limits of this country. Ptolemy makes the river Eleutherus the boundary of Phoenice to the north; but Pliny, Mela, and Stephanus, place it in the island of Aradus, lying north of that river. Strabo observes, that some will have the river Eleutherus to be the boundary of Seleucia, on the side of Phoenice and Coele-Syria. On the coast of Phoenice, and south of the river Eleutherus, stood the following cities: SIMYRA, Orthofoa, TRIPOLIS, Botrys, Byblus, Palaebyblus, Berytus, SIDON, SAREPTA, TYRUS, PALETYRUS.\n\nPhoenice extended, according to Ptolemy, even beyond Mount Carmel; for that geographer places in Phoenice not only Ecdippa and Ptolemais, but Sycaminum and Dera, which stand south of that mountain. These, however, properly speaking, belonged to Palestine. We will not take upon us to mark out the bounds of the midland Phoenice. Ptolemy reckons in it the following towns; Arca, Palaebyblus (Old Byblus), Gabala, and Caesarea Paniae. This province was considerably extended in the times of Christianity; when, being considered as a province of Syria, it included not only Damascus but Palmyra also.\n\nThe soil of this country is good, and productive of many necessaries for food and clothing. The air is wholesome, and the climate agreeable. It is plentifully watered by small rivers; which, running down from Mount Libanus, sometimes swell to an immoderate degree, either increased by the melting of the snows on that mountain, or by heavy rains. Upon these occasions they overflow, to the great danger and hinderance of the traveller and damage of the country. Among these rivers is that of ADONIS.\n\n(A) This last name is a translation of the first. Rabbothen is in Hebrew a great gulf or bay. From rabbothen, by changing the Hebrew r into the Greek r, comes rabboten; and, with a little variation, rhabbothin. Kolpos, colpos, is Greek also for a bay or gulf; whence it appears that colpis or colpites is a translation of rhabbothin.\n\n(B) Bochart supposes that the borderers, both upon the Phoenician and Syrian side, were called by the common name of Syrophoenicians, as partaking equally of both nations.\n\n(C) Or rather Phoenice, Palestine, and Syria, were promiscuously used for each other, and particularly the two former. Phoenice and Palestine, says Stephanus Byzantinus, were the same. As for Syria, we have already observed, that in its largest extent it sometimes comprehended Phoenice and Coele-Syria. Herodotus plainly confounds these three names; we mean, uses one for the other indifferently.\nIt is universally allowed that the Phoenicians were Canaanites (D) by descent; nothing is plainer or less contested, and therefore it was time lost to prove it. We shall only add, that their blood must have been mixed with that of foreigners in process of time, as it happens in all trading places; and that many strange families must have settled among them, who could consequently lay no claim to this remote origin, how muchsoever they may have been called Phoenicians, and reckoned of the same descent with the ancient proprietors.\n\nThe Phoenicians were governed by kings; and their territory, as small as it was, included several kingdoms; namely, those of Sidon, Tyre, Aradus, Berytus, and Byblus. In this particular they imitated and adhered to the primitive government of their forefathers; who, like the other Canaanites, were under many petty princes, to whom they allowed the foreign dignity, referring to themselves the natural rights and liberties of mankind. Of their civil laws we have no particular system.\n\nWith regard to religion, the Phoenicians were the most gross and abominable idolaters. The Baal-berith, Baalzebub, Baalsamen, &c., mentioned in Scripture, were some of the Phoenician gods; as were also the Moloch, Ashtaroth, and Thammuz, mentioned in the sacred writings.\u2014The word Baal, in itself an appellative, was no doubt applied to the true God, until he rejected it on account of its being so much profaned by the idolaters. The name was not appropriated to any particular deity among the idolatrous nations, but was common to many; however, it was generally imagined that one great God presided over all the rest. Among the Phoenicians this deity was named Baal-samen; whom the Hebrews would have called Baal-jhemin, or the God of heaven. In all probability this was also the principal Carthaginian deity, though his Punic name is unknown. We have many religious rites of the Carthaginians handed down to us by the Greek and Roman writers; but they all bestowed names of their own gods upon those of the Carthaginians, which leads us to a knowledge of the correspondence between the characters of the Phoenician and European deities. The principal deity of Carthage, according to Diodorus Siculus, was Chronos or Saturn. The sacrifices offered up to him were children of the best families. Our author also tells us, that the Carthaginians had a brazen statue or colossus of this god, the hands of which were extended in act to receive, and bent downwards in such a manner, that the child laid thereon immediately fell down into a hollow where there was a fiery furnace. He adds also, that this inhuman practice seemed to confirm a tradition, handed down to the Greeks from very early antiquity, viz. that Saturn devoured his own children.\n\nThe goddess Coelitis, or Urania, was held in the highest veneration by the Carthaginians. She is thought to have been the same with the queen of heaven mentioned in Jeremiah, the Juno Olympia of the Greeks. According to Helychius, the same word applied in the Punic language both to Juno and Venus: Nay, the ancient Greeks frequently confound Juno, Venus, and Diana or the moon, all together; which is to be attributed to the Egyptians and Phoenicians, from whom they received their system of religion; who seem in the most ancient times to have had but one name for them all. Besides these there were several other deities of later date, who were worshipped among the Phoenicians, particularly those of Tyre, and consequently among the Carthaginians also. These were Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, and Bacchus. Jupiter was worshipped under the name of Belus or Baal. To him they addressed their oaths; and placed him for the most part, as there is reason to believe, at the head of their treaties. The same name was also given to the other two, whence they were frequently mistaken for one another. Apollo or the sun, went either by this name simply, or by others of which this made a part.\n\nThe Carthaginian superstition, however, was not confined to these deities alone. They worshipped also the fire, air, and other elements; and had gods of rivers, meads, &c. Nay, they paid divine honours to the spirits of their heroes, and even to men and women themselves while yet in life; and in this adoration Hannibal the Great had for some time a share, notwithstanding the infamous conduct of his countrymen towards him at last. In order to worship these gods with more convenience on all occasions, the Carthaginians had a kind of portable temples. These were only covered chariots, in which were some small images representing their favourite deities; and which were drawn by oxen. They were also a kind of oracle; and their responses were understood by the motion impressed upon the vehicle. This was likewise an Egyptian or Libyan custom; and Tacitus informs us that the ancient Germans had something of the same kind. The tabernacle of Moloch is thought to have been a machine of this kind; and it is not improbable that the whole was derived from the tabernacle of the Jews in the wilderness.\n\nBesides all the deities above-mentioned, we still find another, named the Demon or Genius of Carthage, mentioned in the treaty made by Philip of Macedon and Hannibal. What this deity might be, we know not; however, it may be observed, that the pagan world in general believed in the existence of demons, or intelligences who had a kind of middle nature between gods and men, and to whom the administration of the world was in a great measure committed. Hence it is no wonder that they should have received religious honours. For when once mankind were possessed with the opinion that they were the ministers of the gods, and trusted with the dispensation of their favours, as well as the infliction\n\n(D) Bochart infers that the Canaanites were ashamed of their name, on account of the curse denounced on their progenitors, and terrified by the wars so vigorously and successfully waged on them by the Israelites, purely because they were Canaanites; and that therefore, to avoid the ignominy of the one and the danger of the other, they abjured their old name, and changed it for Phoenicians, Syrians, Syrophoenicians, and Assyrians. Heidegger conjectures also that they were ashamed of their ancestor Canaan.\nPhoenicia: fiction of their punishments, it is natural to suppose that they would be desirous of making their addresses to them. See Astarte and Polytheism.\n\nHerodotus supposes the Phoenicians to have been circumcised; but Josephus affirms, that none of the nations included under the vague name of Palestine and Syria used that rite, the Jews excepted; so that if the Phoenicians had anciently that custom, they came in time to neglect it, and at length wholly laid it aside. They obtained however from the flesh of swine.\n\nMuch is said of their arts, sciences, and manufactures; but as what we find concerning them is couched in general terms only, we cannot descant on particulars. The Sidonians, under which denomination we comprehend the Phoenicians in general, were of most happy genius. They were from the beginning addicted to philosophical exercises of the mind; inasmuch that a Sidonian, by name Mochus, taught the doctrine of atoms before the Trojan war; and Abomenus of Tyre puzzled Solomon by the subtlety of his questions. Phoenice continued to be one of the seats of learning, and both Tyre and Sidon produced their philosophers of later ages; namely, Boethus and Diodatus of Sidon, Antipater of Tyre, and Appollonius of the same place; who gave an account of the writings and disciples of Zeno. For their language, see Philology, no. 61.\n\nAs to their manufactures, the glafs of Sidon, the purple of Tyre, and the exceeding fine linen they wove, were the product of their own country, and their own invention; and for their extraordinary skill in working metals, in hewing timber and stone; in a word, for their perfect knowledge of what was solid, great, and ornamental in architecture\u2014we need only put the reader in mind of the large share they had in erecting and decorating the temple at Jerusalem under their king Hiram. Their fame for taste, design, and ingenious invention, was such, that whatever was elegant, great, or pleasing, whether in apparel, vessels, or toys, was distinguished by way of excellence with the epithet of Sidonian.\n\nThe Phoenicians were likewise celebrated merchants, navigators, and planters of colonies in foreign parts. As merchants, they may be said to have engrossed all the commerce of the western world; as navigators, they were the boldest, the most experienced, and greatest discoverers, of the ancient times: they had for many ages no rivals. In planting colonies they exerted themselves so much, that, considering their habitation was little more than the slip of ground between Mount Libanus and the sea, it is surprising how they could furnish such supplies of people; and not wholly depopulate their native country.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the Phoenicians were induced to deal in foreign commodities by their neighbourhood with the Syrians, who were perhaps the most ancient of those who carried on a considerable and regular trade with the more eastern regions; and this conjecture appears probable at least; for their own territory was but small, and little able to afford any considerable exports, if we except manufactures: but that their manufactures were anyways considerable till they began to turn all the channels of trade into their own country, it is hard to believe. In Syria, which was a large country, they found store of productions of the natural growth of that soil, and many choice and useful commodites brought from the east. Thus, having Phoenicia, a safe coast, with convenient harbours, on one side, and excellent materials for ship-building on the other; perceiving how acceptable many commodities that Syria furnished would be in foreign parts, and being at the same time, perhaps, thrown the way by the Syrians themselves, who may have navigated the Mediterranean\u2014they turned all their thoughts to trade and navigation, and by an uncommon application soon eclipsed their masters in that art.\n\nIt were in vain to talk of the Edomites, who fled hither in David's time; or to inquire why Herodotus supposes the Phoenicians came from the Red Sea: their origin we have already seen. That some of the Edomites fled into this country in the days of David, and that they were a trading people, is very evident: what improvements they brought with them into Phoenice, it is hard to say; and by the way, it is as difficult to ascertain their numbers. In all probability they brought with them a knowledge of the Red Sea, and of the fourth parts of Arabia, Egypt, and Ethiopia; and by their information made the Phoenicians acquainted with those coasts; by which means they were enabled to undertake voyages to those parts, for Solomon, and Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt.\n\nTheir whole thoughts were employed on schemes to advance their commerce. They affected no empire but that of the sea; and seemed to aim at nothing but the peaceable enjoyment of their trade. This they extended to all the known parts they could reach; to the British isles, commonly understood by the Caliderides; to Spain, and other places in the ocean, both within and without the straits of Gibraltar; and, in general, to all the ports of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the lake Maeotis. In all these parts they had settlements and correspondents, from which they drew what was useful to themselves, or might be so to others; and thus they exercised the three great branches of trade, as it is commonly divided into importation, exportation, and transportation, in full latitude. Such was their sea-trade; and for that which they carried on by land in Syria, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Arabia, and even in India, it was of no less extent, and may give us an idea of what this people once was, how rich and how deservedly their merchants are mentioned in Scripture as equal to princes. Their country was, at that time, the great warehouse, where every thing that might either administer to the necessities or luxury of mankind was to be found; which they distributed as they judged would be the best for their own interest. The purple of Tyre, the glafs of Sidon, and the exceeding fine linen made in this country, together with other curious pieces of art in metals and wood, already mentioned, appear to have been the chief and almost only commodities of Phoenice itself. Indeed their territory was so small, that it is not to be imagined they could afford to export any of their own growth; it is more likely that they rather wanted than abounded with the fruits of the earth.\n\nHaving thus spoken in general terms of their trade, we shall now touch upon their shipping and some things remarkable in their navigation. Their larger embarkations were of two sorts; they divided them into round ships or gauli; and long ships, galleys, or triremes. When they drew up in line of battle, the gauli were dif-\nposed at a small distance from each other in the wings, or in the van and the rear; their triremes were contracted together in the centre. If, at any time, they observed that a stranger kept them company in their voyage, or followed in their track, they were sure to get rid of him if they could, or deceive him if possible; in which policy they went so far, as to venture the loss of their ships, and even their lives; so jealous were they of foreigners, and so tenaciously bent on keeping the whole trade to themselves. In order to discourage other nations from engaging in commerce, they practised piracy, or pretended to be at war with such as they met when they thought themselves strongest. This was but a natural stroke of policy in people who grasped at the whole commerce of the then known world. We must not forget here the famous fishery of Tyre, which, to remarkably enriched that city. See Astronomy, n\u00b0 7.","sp":10,"ep":13},{"h":"PHOENIX","t":"in Astronomy.

There is only one species, viz. the daetylifera, or common date-tree, a native of Africa and eastern countries, where it grows to 50, 60, and 100 feet high. The trunk is round, upright, and fluted with protuberances, which are the vestiges of the decayed leaves. From the top issues forth a cluster of leaves or branches eight or nine feet long, extending all around like an umbrella, and bending a little towards the earth. The bottom part produces a number of stalks like those of the middle, but seldom shooting to high as four or five feet. These stalks, says Adamant, diffuse the tree very considerably; so that, wherever it naturally grows in forests, it is extremely difficult to open a passage through its prickly leaves. The date-tree was introduced into Jamaica soon after the conquest of the island by the Spaniards. There are however, but few of them in Jamaica at this time. The fruit is somewhat in the shape of an acorn. It is composed of a thin, light, and glossy membrane, somewhat pellucid and yellowish; which contains a fine, soft, and pulpy fruit, which is firm, sweet, and somewhat vinous to the taste, excellent, and wholesome; and within this is inclosed a solid, tough, and hard kernel, of a pale grey colour on the outside, and finely marbled within like the nutmeg. For medicinal use dates are to be chosen large, full, fresh, yellow on the surface, soft and tender, not too much wrinkled; such as have a vinous taste, and do not rattle when shaken. They are produced in many parts of Europe, but never ripen perfectly there. The best are brought from Tunis; they are also very fine and good in Egypt and in many parts of the east. Those of Spain and France look well; but are never perfectly ripe, and very subject to decay. They are preserved three different ways; some preserved and dry; others pressed more moderately, and again moistened with their own juice; and others not pressed at all, but moistened with the juice of other dates, as they are packed up, which is done in baskets or skins. Those preserved in this last way are much the best. Dates Phoenix, have always been esteemed moderately strengthening and alluring.\n\nThough the date tree grows everywhere indiscriminately on the northern coasts of Africa, it is not cultivated with care, except beyond Mount Atlas; because the heat is not sufficiently powerful along the coasts to bring the fruits to proper maturity. We shall here extract some observations from Mr. Des Fontaines respecting the manner of cultivating it in Barbary, and on the different uses to which it is applied. All that part of the Zara which is near Mount Atlas, and the only part of this vast desert which is inhabited, produces very little corn; the soil being sandy, and burnt up by the sun, is almost entirely unfit for the cultivation of grain, its only productions of that kind being a little barley, maize, and forgo. The date-tree, however, supplies the deficiency of corn to the inhabitants of these countries, and furnishes them with almost the whole of their subsistence. They have flocks of sheep; but as they are not numerous, they prefer them for the sake of their wool; besides, the flesh of these animals is very unwholesome food in countries that are excessively warm; and these people, though ignorant, have probably been enabled by experience to know that it was salutary for them to abstain from it. The date trees are planted without any order, at the distance of 12 feet one from the other, in the neighbourhood of rivulets and streams which issue from the land. Forests of them may be seen here and there, some of which are several leagues in circumference. The extent of these plantations depends upon the quantity of water which can be procured to water them; for they require much moisture. All these forests are intermixed with orange, almond, and pomegranate trees, and with vines which twist round the trunks of the date trees; and the heat is strong enough to ripen the fruit, though they are never exposed to the sun.\n\nAlong the rivulets and streams, dykes are erected to stop the course of their waters, in order that they may be distributed amongst the date trees by means of small canals. The number of canals is fixed for each individual; and in several cantons, to have a right to them, the proprietors are obliged to pay an annual sum proportionable to the number and extent of their plantations. Care is taken to till the earth well, and to raise a circular border around the root of each tree, that the water may remain longer and in larger quantity. The date trees are watered in every season, but more particularly during the great heats of summer.\n\nIt is generally in winter that new plantations of this tree are formed. For this purpose those who cultivate them take shoots of those which produce the best dates, and plant them at a small distance one from the other. At the end of three or four years these shoots, if they have been properly taken care of, begin to bear fruit; but this fruit is as yet dry, without sweetness, and even without kernels; they never reach the highest degree of perfection of which they are susceptible till they are about 15 or 20 years old.\n\nThese plants are however produced from the seeds taken out of the fruit, provided they are fresh. They should be sown in pots filled with light rich earth, and plunged into a moderate hotbed of tanners bark, which\nshould be kept in a moderate temperature of heat, and the earth frequently refreshed with water. When the plants are come up to a proper size, they should be each planted in a separate small pot, filled with the same light earth, and plunged into a hotbed again, observing to refresh them with water, as also to let them have air in proportion to the warmth of the season and the bed in which they are placed. During the summer time they should remain in the same hotbed; but in the beginning of August, they should have a great share of air to harden them against the approach of winter; for if they are too much forced, they will be so tender as not to be preserved through the winter without much difficulty, especially if you have not the conveniency of a bark stove to keep them in. The soil in which these plants should be placed, must be composed in the following manner, viz. half of light fresh earth taken from a pasture-ground, the other half sea sand and rotten dung or tanners bark in equal proportion; these should be carefully mixed, and laid in a heap three or four months at least before it is used, but should be often turned over to prevent the growth of weeds, and to sweeten the earth.\n\nThe trees, however, which spring from seed never produce so good dates as those that are raised from shoots; they being always poor and ill tasted. It is undoubtedly by force of cultivation, and after several generations, that they acquire a good quality.\n\nThe date trees which have been originally sown, grow rapidly, and we have been assured that they bear fruit in the fourth or fifth year. Care is taken to cut the inferior branches of the date tree in proportion as they rise; and a piece of the root is always left of some inches in length, which affords the easy means of climbing to the summit. These trees live a long time, according to the account of the Arabs; and in order to prove it, they say that when they have attained to their full growth, no change is observed in them for the space of three generations.\n\nThe number of females which are cultivated is much superior to that of the males, because they are much more profitable. The sexual organs of the date tree grow, as is well known, upon different stalks, and these trees flower in the months of April and May, at which time the Arabs cut the male branches to impregnate the female. For this purpose, they make an incision in the trunk of each branch which they wish to produce fruit, and place in it a stalk of male flowers; without this precaution the date tree would produce only abortive fruit (A). In some cantons the male branches are only shaken over the female. The practice of impregnating the date tree in this manner is very ancient. Pliny describes it very accurately in that part of his work where he treats of the palm tree.\n\nThere is scarcely any part of the date tree which is not useful. The wood, though of a spongy texture, lasts such a number of years, that the inhabitants of the country say it is incorruptible. They employ it for making beams and instruments of husbandry; it burns slowly, but the coals which result from its combustion are very strong, and produce a great heat.\n\nThe Arabs strip the bark and fibrous parts from the young date trees, and eat the substance which is in the centre; it is very nourishing, and has a sweet taste: it is known by the name of the marrow of the date tree. They eat also the leaves, when they are young and tender, with lemon juice; the old ones are laid out to dry, and are employed for making mats and other works of the same kind, which are much used, and with which they carry on a considerable trade in the interior parts of the country. From the sides of the stumps of the branches which have been left arise a great number of delicate filaments, of which they make ropes, and which might serve to fabricate cloth.\n\nOf the fresh dates and sugar, says Haffelquill, the Egyptians make a conserve, which has a very pleasant taste. In Egypt they use the leaves as fly-flaps, for driving away the numerous insects which prove troublesome in hot countries. The hard boughs are used for fences and other purposes of husbandry; the principal item for building. The fruit, before it is ripe, is somewhat astringent; but when thoroughly mature, is of the nature of the fig. The Senegal dates are shorter than those of Egypt, but much thicker in the pulp, which is said to have a fugitive agreeable taste, superior to that of the best dates of the Levant.\n\nA white liquor, known by the name of milk, is drawn also from the date tree. To obtain it, all the branches are cut from the summit of one of these trees, and after several incisions have been made in it, they are covered with leaves, in order that the heat of the sun may not dry it.\n\nThe sap drops down into a vessel placed to receive it, at the bottom of a circular groove, made below the incisions. The milk of the date tree has a sweet and agreeable taste when it is new; it is very refreshing, and it is even given to sick people to drink, but it generally turns sour at the end of 24 hours. Old trees are chosen for this operation, because the cutting of the branches, and the large quantity of sap which flows from them, greatly exhaust them, and often cause them to decay.\n\nThe male flowers of the date tree are also useful. They\n\n---\n\n(A) The celebrated Linn\u00e6us, in his Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants, speaking of the date tree, says, \"A female date-bearing palm flowered many years at Berlin without producing any seeds; but the Berlin people taking care to have some of the blossoms of the male tree, which was then flowering at Leipzig, sent to them by the post, they obtained fruit by these means; and some dates, the offspring of this impregnation, being planted in my garden, sprung up, and to this day continue to grow vigorously. Kemper formerly told us, how necessary it was found by the oriental people, who live upon the produce of palm-trees, and are the true Lotophagi, to plant some male trees among the females, if they hoped for any fruit: hence it is the practice of those who make war in that part of the world to cut down all the male palms, that a famine may afflict their proprietors; sometimes even the inhabitants themselves destroy the male trees when they dread an invasion, that their enemies may find no sustenance in the country.\"\nPhoenix. They are eaten when still tender, mixed up with a little lemon juice. They are reckoned to be very provocative; the odour which they exhale is probably the cause of this property being ascribed to them.\n\nThese date trees are very lucrative to the inhabitants of the desert. Some of them produce 20 bunches of dates; but care is always taken to lop off a part of them, that those which remain may become larger; 10 or 12 bunches only are left on the most vigorous trees.\n\nIt is reckoned that a good tree produces, one year with another, about the value of 10 or 12 shillings to the proprietor. A pretty considerable trade is carried on with dates in the interior part of the country, and large quantities of them are exported to France and Italy. The crop is gathered towards the end of November. When the bunches are taken from the tree, they are hung up in some very dry place where they may be sheltered and secure from insects.\n\nDates afford wholesome nourishment, and have a very agreeable taste when they are fresh. The Arabs eat them without leavening. They dry and harden them in the sun, to reduce them to a kind of meal, which they lay up in store to supply themselves with food during the long journeys which they often undertake across their deserts. This simple food is sufficient to nourish them for a long time.\u2014The inhabitants of the Zara procure also from their dates a kind of honey which is exceedingly sweet. For this purpose they choose those which have the softest pulp; and having put them into a large jar with a hole in the bottom, they squeeze them by placing over them a weight of eight or ten pounds.\u2014The moist fluid part of the substance, which drops through the hole, is what they call the honey of the date.\n\nEven the stones, though very hard, are not thrown away. They give them to their camels and sheep as food, after they have bruised them or laid them to soften in water.\n\nThe date, as well as other trees which are cultivated, exhibits great variety in its fruit, with respect to shape, size, quality, and even colour. There are reckoned to be at least twenty different kinds. Dates are very liable to be pierced by worms, and they soon corrupt in moist or rainy weather.\n\nFrom what has been said, it may easily be perceived, that there is, perhaps, no tree whatever used for so many and so valuable purposes as the date tree.\n\nPhoenix, in antiquity, a famous bird, which is generally looked upon by the moderns as fabulous. The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its kind; they describe it as of the size of an eagle; its head finely crested with a beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and the rest of its body purple, only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling like stars: they hold, that it lives 500 or 600 years in the wilderness; that when thus advanced in age, it builds itself a pile of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and fires it with the wasting of its wings, and thus burns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time grows up to be a phoenix. Hence the Phenicians gave the name of phoenix to the palm-tree; because when burnt down to the root it rises again fairer than ever.\n\nIn the sixth book of the Annals of Tacitus, sect. 28.\n\nVol. XVI. Part II.\nfrom their property of making themselves holes in the earth, sand, wood, or stone, and living in them. The means of their getting there, however, are as yet entirely unknown. All that we can know with certainty is, that they must have penetrated these substances when very small; because the entrance of the hole in which the pholas lodges is always much less than the inner part of it, and indeed than the shell of the pholas itself. Hence some have supposed that they were hatched in holes accidentally formed in stones, and that they naturally grew of such a shape as was necessary to fill the cavity.\n\nThe holes in which the pholas lodge are usually twice as deep, at least, as the shells themselves are long; the figure of the holes is that of a truncated cone, excepting that they are terminated at the bottom by a rounded cavity, and their position is usually somewhat oblique to the horizon. The openings of these holes are what betray the pholas being in the stone; but they are always very small in proportion to the size of the fish. There seems to be no progressive motion of any animal in nature so slow as that of the pholas; it is immersed in the hole, and has no movement except a small one towards the centre of the earth; and this is only proportioned to the growth of the animal. Its work is very difficult in its motion; but it has great time to perform it in, as it only moves downward, sinking itself deeper in the stone as it increases itself in bulk. That part by means of which it performs this, is a fleshy substance placed near the lower extremity of the shell; it is of the shape of a lozenge, and is considerably large in proportion to the size of the animal; and though it be of a soft substance, it is not to be wondered at that in so long a time it is able, by constant work, to burrow into a hard stone. The manner of their performing this may be seen by taking one of them out of the stone, and placing it upon some soft clay; for they will immediately get to work in bending and extending that part allotted to dig for them, and in a few hours they will bury themselves in the mud in as large a hole as they had taken many years to make in the stone. They find little resistance in so soft a substance; and the necessity of their hiding themselves evidently makes them hasten their work. The animal is lodged in the lower half of the hole in the stone, and the upper half is filled up by a pipe of a fleshy substance and conic figure, truncated at the end: this they usually extend to the orifice of the hole, and place on a level with the surface of the stone; but they seldom extend it any farther than this. The pipe, though it appears single, is in reality composed of two pipes, or at least it is composed of two parts separated by a membrane. The use of this pipe or proboscis is the same with that of the proboscis of other shell-fish, to take in sea-water into their bodies, and afterwards to throw it out again. In the middle of their bodies they have a small green vessel, the use of which has not yet been discovered. This, when plunged in spirit-of-wine, becomes of a purple colour: but its colour on linen does not become purple in the sun like that of the murex.\n\nThe pholas is remarkable for its luminous quality, which was noticed by Pliny, who observes that it shines in the mouth of the person who eats it; and if it touch his hands or clothes, it makes them luminous. He also says that the light depends upon its moisture. The light of this fish has furnished matter for various observations and experiments to M. Reaumur and the Bolognian academicians, especially Beccarius, who took so much pains with the subject of phosphorescent light.\n\nM. Reaumur observes, that whereas other fishes give light when they tend to putrefaction, this is more luminous in proportion to its being fresh; that when they are dried, their light will revive if they be moistened either with fresh or salt water, but that brandy immediately extinguishes it. He endeavoured to make this light permanent, but none of his schemes succeeded.\n\nThe attention of the Bolognian academicians was engaged to this subject by M. F. Marfilius in 1724, who brought a number of these fishes, and the stones in which they were inclosed, to Bologna, on purpose for their examination.\n\nBeccarius observed, that though this fish ceased to shine when it became putrid, yet that in its most putrid state it would shine, and make the water in which it was immersed luminous when it was agitated. Galeatus and Montius found that wine or vinegar extinguished this light; that in common oil it continued some days, but in rectified spirit of wine or urine hardly a minute.\n\nIn order to observe in what manner this light was affected by different degrees of heat, they made use of a Reaumur's thermometer, and found that water rendered luminous by these fishes increased in light till the heat arrived to $45^\\circ$, but that it then became suddenly extinct, and could not be revived again.\n\nIn the experiments of Beccarius, a solution of sea-salt increased the light of the luminous water; a solution of nitre did not increase it quite so much. Sal ammoniac diminished it a little, oil of tartar per deliquium nearly extinguished it, and the acids entirely. This water, poured upon fresh calcined gypsum, rock-crystal, ceruse, or sugar, became more luminous. He also tried the effects of it when poured upon various other substances, but there was nothing very remarkable in them. Afterwards, using luminous milk, he found that oil of vitriol extinguished the light, but that of tartar increased it.\n\nThis gentleman had the curiosity to try how differently coloured substances were affected by this kind of light; and having, for this purpose, dipped several ribbons in it, the white came out the brightest, next to this was the yellow, and then the green; the other colours could hardly be perceived. It was not, however, any particular colour, but only light, that was perceived in this case. He then dipped boards painted with the different colours, and also glass tubes filled with substances of different colours, in water rendered luminous by the fishes. In both these cases, the red was hardly visible, the yellow was the brightest, and the violet the dullest. But on the boards, the blue was nearly equal to the yellow, and the green more languid; whereas in the glasses, the blue was inferior to the green.\n\nOf all the liquors to which he put the pholas, milk was rendered the most luminous. A single pholas made seven ounces of milk so luminous, that the faces of persons might be distinguished by it, and it looked as if it were transparent.\n\nAir appeared to be necessary to this light: for when Beccarius put the luminous milk into glass tubes, no agitation would make it shine unless bubbles of air were mixed.\nPholeys, ed with it. Also Montius and Galeatus found, that, in an exhausted receiver, the pholas lost its light, but the water was sometimes made more luminous: which they ascribed to the rising of bubbles of air through it.\n\nBeccarius, as well as Reaumur, had many schemes to render the light of these pholades permanent. For this purpose he kneaded the juice into a kind of paste with flour, and found that it would give light when it was immersed in warm water; but it answered best to preserve the fish in honey. In any other method of preservation, the property of becoming luminous would not continue longer than six months, but in honey it had lasted above a year; and then it would, when plunged in warm water, give as much light as ever it had done.

Some authors tell us, that the kingdom of Pholey, from whence they derive their name, is divided from that of Jaloff by a lake called in the language of the Mundingoes Cayor; and that it stretches from east to west about 180 miles; but that, though it extends a great way south, its limits in that direction are not exactly ascertained.\n\nMr Moore, however, gives a very different account, and says, that the Pholeys live in clans, build towns, and are in every kingdom and country on each side of the river; yet are not subject to any of the kings of the country, though they live in their territories; for if they are used ill in one nation, they break up their towns, and remove to another. They have chiefs of their own, who rule with such moderation, that every act of government seems rather an act of the people than of one man. This form of government is easily administered, because the people are of a good and quiet disposition, and so well instructed in what is just and right, that a man who does ill exposes himself to universal contempt.\n\nThe natives of all these countries, not being avaricious of land, desire no more than they can use; and as they do not plough with horses or other cattle, they can use but very little; and hence the kings willingly allow the Pholeys to live in their dominions, and cultivate the earth.\n\nThe Pholeys have in general a tawny complexion, though many of them are of as deep a black as the Mundingoes; and it is supposed that their alliances with the Moors have given them the mixed colour between the true olive and the black. They are rather of a low stature, but have a genteel and easy shape, with an air peculiarly delicate and agreeable.\n\nThough they are strangers in the country, they are the greatest planters in it. They are extremely industrious and frugal, and raise much more corn and cotton than they consume, which they sell at reasonable rates; and are so remarkable for their hospitality, that the natives esteem it a blessing to have a Pholey town in their neighbourhood; and their behaviour has gained them such reputation, that it is esteemed infamous for any one to treat them in an inhospitable manner. Their humanity extends to all, but they are doubly kind to people of their race; and if they know of any one of their body being made a slave, they will readily redeem him. As they have plenty of food, they never suffer any of their own people to want; but support the old, the blind, and the lame, equally with the others.\n\nThese people are seldom angry; and Mr Moore observes that he never heard them abuse each other; yet this mildness is far from proceeding from want of courage, they being as brave as any people of Africa, and very expert in the use of their arms, which are javelins, cutlasses, bows and arrows, and upon occasion guns. They usually settle near some Mundingoe town, there being scarce any of note up the river that has not a Pholey town near it. Most of them speak Arabic, which is taught in their schools; and they are able to read the Koran in that language, though they have a vulgar tongue called Pholey. They are strict Mahometans, and scarce any of them will drink brandy, or anything stronger than sugar and water.\n\nThey are so skilful in the management of cattle, that the Mundingoes leave theirs to their care. The whole herd belonging to a town feed all day in the savannahs, and after the crop is off, in the rice-grounds. They have a place without each town for their cattle, surrounded by a circular hedge, and within this enclosure they raise a stage about eight feet high, and eight or ten feet wide, covered with a thatched roof; all the sides are open, and they ascend to it by a ladder. Round this stage they fix a number of stakes, and when the cattle are brought up at night, each beast is tied to a separate stake with a strong rope made of the bark of trees. The cows are then milked, and four or five men stay upon the stage all night with their arms to guard them from the lions, tygers, and other wild beasts. Their huts are built in a very regular manner, they being round structures, placed in rows at a distance from each other to avoid fire, and each of them has a thatched roof somewhat resembling a high-crowned hat.\n\nThey are also great huntsmen, and not only kill lions, tygers, and other wild beasts, but frequently go 20 or 30 in a company to hunt elephants; whose teeth they sell, and whose flesh they smoke-dry and eat, keeping it for several months together. As the elephants here generally go in droves of 100 or 200, they do great mischief by pulling up the trees by the roots, and trampling down the corn; to prevent which, when the natives have any suspicion of their coming, they make fires round their corn to keep them out.\n\nThey are almost the only people who make butter, and sell cattle at some distance up the river. They are very particular in their dress, and never wear any other clothes but long robes of white cotton, which they make themselves. They are always very clean, especially the women, who keep their huts exceedingly neat. They are, however, in some particulars very superstitious: for if they chance to know that any person who buys milk of them boils it, they will from thenceforth on no consideration sell that person any more, from their imagining that boiling the milk makes the cows dry.","sp":17,"ep":17},{"h":"PHOLIS","t":"in Natural History, is an old name for gypsums or plaster-stones.

Of this plant there are two sorts; the leaves of both resemble those of flags, but the flowers are smaller, and their clusters more numerous; in one kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of these plants, with very little preparation, they make all their common apparel, and also their strings, lines, and cordage, for every purpose; which are so much stronger than anything we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a comparison.\u2014From the same plant, by another preparation, they draw long slender fibres, which shine like silk, and are as white as snow: of these, which are very strong, they make their finest cloths; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths, and tying the strips together, they make their fishing nets, some of which are of enormous size.\n\nThe seeds of this valuable plant were brought over into England; but, upon the first trial, appeared to have lost their vegetating power.

Putrefaction, and in some degree alkaline lixivia, destroy the pulpy or fleshy matter, and leave the tough filaments entire.

In Madagascar, different kinds of cloth are prepared from the filaments of the bark of certain trees boiled in strong ley; and of some of these cloths are very fine, and approach to the softness of silk, but in durability come short of cotton: others are coarser and stronger, and last twice as long as cotton; and of these filaments they make sails and cordage to their vessels. The stalks of nettles are sometimes used for like purposes, even in France; and Sir Hans Sloane relates, in one of his letters to Mr Ray, that he has been informed by several, that muslin and calico, and most of the Indian linens, are made of nettles. A strong kind of cloth is said to be prepared in some of the provinces of Sweden of hop-stalks; and in the Transactions of the Swedish Academy for 1750, we have an account of an experiment relating to this subject: A quantity of stalks was gathered in autumn, which was equal in bulk to a quantity of flax sufficient to yield a pound after preparation. The stalks were put into water, and kept covered with it during the winter. In March, they were taken out, dried in a stove, and dressed as flax. The prepared filaments weighed nearly a pound, and proved fine, soft, and white; they were spun and wove into six ells of fine strong cloth. Unless the stalks are fully rotted, which will take much longer time than flax, the woody part will not separate, and the cloth will prove neither white Phosphat nor fine.\n\nPHOSPHATE is a saline body composed of phosphoric acid united to some base, as for instance, lime, which is called phosphate of lime.

He wrote a Bibliotheca, which contains an examination of 280 authors: we have also 233 epistles of his; the Nomocanon under 14 titles; an abridgement of the acts of several councils, &c. This great man was born in Constantinople, and was descended from a very illustrious and noble family. His natural abilities were very great, and he cultivated them with the greatest fidelity.\nPhotius, fidelity. There was no branch of literature, whether sacred or profane, and scarcely any art or science, in which he was not deeply versed. Indeed he appears to have been by far the greatest man of the age in which he lived; and was so intimately concerned in the chief transactions of it, that ecclesiastical writers have on that account called it Seculum Photianum. He was first raised to the chief dignities of the empire, being made principal secretary of state, captain of the guards, and a senator. In all these stations he acquitted himself with a distinction suitable to his great abilities; for he was a refined statesman, as well as a profound scholar. His rise to the patriarchate was very quick; for when he was chosen to that office he was only a layman: but that he might be as it were gradually raised to that dignity, he was made monk the first day, reader the next, and the following days sub-deacon, deacon, and priest. So that in the space of six days he attained to the highest office in the church. On the whole, however, his ardent love of glory and unbounded ambition made him commit excesses which rendered him a scourge to those about him.\n\nFabricius calls his Bibliotheca or library, non liber, sed infugis thesaurus, \"not a book, but an illustrious treasure,\" in which are contained many curious things, relating to authors, and many fragments of works which are nowhere else to be found. It was brought to light by Andreas Schottus, and communicated by him to David Hoefelius, who caused it to be printed in 1651. Schottus, considering the great utility of this work, translated it into Latin, and printed his translation alone in 1666. The Greek text, together with the translation, was afterwards printed at Geneva in 1671.","sp":18,"ep":19},{"h":"PHOTOMETER","t":"an instrument for ascertaining the intensity of light.

The accused was not allowed to come to land, or so much as to cast anchor, but pleaded his cause in his bark; and if found guilty, was committed to the mercy of the winds and waves, or, as some say, suffered there condign punishment; if innocent, he was only cleared of the second fact, and, according to custom, underwent a twelve-month's banishment for the former.

From whence it derived its name is not certain: some say it was from the river Phryx (now Sarabat), which divides Phrygia from Caria, and empties itself into the Hermus; others from Phrygia, the daughter of Alopus and Europa. The Greek writers tell us, that the country took its name from the inhabitants, and these from the town of Brygium in Macedonia, from whence they first passed into Asia, and gave the name of Phrygia or Brygia to the country where they settled. Bochart is of opinion that this tract was called Phrygia from the Greek verb \u03c6\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \"to burn or parch;\" which, according to him, is a translation of its Hebrew name, derived from a verb of the same signification.\n\nNo less various are the opinions of authors as to the exact boundaries of this country; an uncertainty which gave rise to an observation made by Strabo, viz. that the Phrygians and Myrians had distinct boundaries; but that it was scarce possible to ascertain them. The same writer adds, that the Trojans, Myrians, and Lydians, are, by the poets, all blended under the common name of Phrygians, which Claudian extends to the Pifidians, Bithynians, and Ionians. Phrygia Proper, according to Ptolemy, whom we choose to follow, was bounded on the north by Pontus and Bithynia; on the west by Myria, Troas, the Aegean Sea, Lydia, M\u00e6onia, and Caria; on the south by Lycia; on the east by Pamphylia and Galatia. It lies between the 37th and 41st degrees of north latitude, extending in longitude from 56 to 62 degrees. The inhabitants of this country, mentioned by Ptolemy, are the Lycaones and Anthemieni, towards Lycia; and Moccadels or Moccadine, the Cyddefes or Cydides towards Bithynia; and between these the Petimi or Speltini, the Moxiani, Phylacenes, and Hierapolites. To these we may add the Berecynites mentioned by Strabo.\n\nPhrygia is commonly divided into the Greater and Lesser Phrygia, called also Troas. But this division did not take place till Troas was subdued by the Phrygians; and hence it is more considered by some Roman writers as a part of Phrygia, than Bithynia, Cappadocia,\nPhrygia, or any other of the adjacent provinces. In after ages, the Greater Phrygia was divided into two districts or governments; one called Phrygia Pacatiana, from Pacatianus, who, under Constantine, bore the great office of the praefectus praetorio of the East; the other Phrygia Salutaris, from some miraculous cures supposed to have been performed there by the archangel Michael.\n\nThis country, and indeed all Asia Minor, as lying in the fifth and sixth northern climates, was in ancient times greatly celebrated for its fertility. It abounded in all sorts of grain; being, for the most part, a plain country covered with a deep rich soil, and plentifully watered by small rivers. It was in some parts productive of bitumen and other combustible substances. It was well stocked with cattle, having large plains and pasture grounds. The air was anciently deemed most pure and wholesome, though it is now in some parts thought extremely gross, great part of the country lying uncultivated.\n\nIn Phrygia Major were anciently several cities of great celebrity; such as Apamea, Laodicea, Hierapolis, Gordium, &c.\u2014There were also some famous rivers; such as Marysas, Maeander, &c. The Maeander is now called Madre or Mindre, and was much celebrated by the ancients for its windings and turnings; from whence all such windings and turnings have been denominated meanders.\n\nThe Phrygians accounted themselves the most ancient people in the world. Their origin, however, is extremely dark and uncertain. Josephus and St Jerome say, they were descended from Togarmah, one of Gomer's sons; and that they were known to the Hebrews under the name of Tigranimanes. The Heathen authors derive them from the Brygians, a people of Macedonia. But this is but mere conjecture; and it is a conjecture totally unsupported, except by the similarity of names. Bochart thinks that the Phrygians were the offspring of Gomer the eldest son of Japhet; the word Phrygia being the Greek translation of his name. Josephus makes Gomer the father of the Galatians; but he, by the Galatians, must necessarily mean the Phrygians inhabiting that part of Phrygia which the Galatians had made themselves masters of; the descendants of Gomer being placed by Ezekiel northward of Judaea, near Togarmah (which Bochart takes to be Cappadocia), long before the Gauls passed over into Asia. We are willing to let Gomer enjoy the fine country which Bochart is pleased to give him, and allow him the honour of being the progenitor of the Phrygians, since we know no other person on whom it can be conferred with any degree of probability.\n\nThe ancient Phrygians are described as superstitious, voluptuous, and effeminate, without any prudence or foresight, and of such a servile temper, that nothing but stripes and ill usage could make them comply with their duty; which gave rise to several trite and well-known proverbs (A). They are said to have been the first inventors of divination by the fingering, flying, and feeding of birds. Their music, commonly called the Phrygian mood, is alleged by some as an argument of their effeminacy.\n\nThis government was certainly monarchical; for all Phrygia was, during the reigns of some kings, subject to one prince. Ninnacus, Midas, Manis, Gordius, and his descendants, were undoubtedly sovereigns of all Phrygia. But some time before the Trojan war, we find this country divided into several petty kingdoms, and read of divers princes reigning at the same time. Apollodorus mentions a king of Phrygia contemporary with Ilus king of Troy. Cedrenus and others speak of one Teuthrans, king of a small country in Phrygia, whose territories were ravaged by Ajax, himself slain in single combat, his royal seat laid in ashes, and his daughter, by name Tecmessa, carried away captive by the conqueror. Homer makes mention of Phoreys and Arcanius, both princes and leaders of the Phrygian auxiliaries that came to the relief of Troy. Tantalus was king of Sipylus only, and its district; a prince no less famous for his great wealth, than infamous for his covetousness and other detestable vices. That Phrygia was subdued either by Ninus, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, or by the Amazons, as we read in Suidas, is not sufficiently warranted. Most authors that speak of Gordius tell us, that the Phrygians having sent to consult an oracle in order to know how they might put an end to the intestine broils which rent their country into many factions and parties, received for answer, that the most effectual means to deliver themselves and their country from the calamities they groaned under, was to commit the government to a king. This advice they followed accordingly, and placed Gordius on the throne.\n\nApamea was the chief emporium of all Asia Minor.\u2014Thither resorted merchants and traders from all parts of Greece, Italy, and the neighbouring islands. Besides, we know from Syncellus, that the Phrygians were for some time masters of the sea; and none but trading nations ever prevailed on that element. The country produced many choice and useful commodities, which afforded considerable exports. They had a safe coast, convenient harbours, and whatever may incline us to think that they carried on a considerable trade. But as most of the Phrygian records are lost, we will not dwell on conjectures so difficult to be ascertained.\n\nWe have no set form of their laws; and as to their learning, since we are told that for some time they enjoyed the sovereignty of the sea, we may at least allow them a competent skill in geography, geometry, and astronomy; and add to these, from what we have said above, a more than ordinary knowledge of music.\n\nSome have been of opinion that the Phrygian language bore a great resemblance to the Greek; but\n\n(A) \"Phryges fero sapiunt, Phryx verberatus melior, Phryx non minus quam Syntharus, &c.:\u201d which proverbs intimate their servile temper; and show that they were more fit to bewail misfortunes in an unmanly manner, than to prevent them by proper measures. Their music, too, was suited to their effeminate temper. The Doric mood was a kind of grave and solid music; the Lydian a doleful and lamentable harmony; but the Phrygian chiefly calculated to effeminate and enervate the mind. But this character is contradicted by others.\nthe contrary is manifest from the few Phrygian words which have been transmitted to us, and carefully collected by Bochart and Rudbeckius. To these we may add the authority of Strabo, who, after attempting to derive the name of a Phrygian city from the Greek, concludes, that it is a difficult matter to discover any similitude between the barbarous words of the Phrygian language and the Greek. The Phrygian tongue, after the experiment made by Ptolemy king of Egypt, was looked upon by the Egyptians as the most ancient language of the world. But other nations, particularly the Scythians, refused to submit to their opinion, as founded on an argument of no real weight. \"As the two children (say they) had never heard the voice of any human creature, the word *b\u0113k*, or *bektor*, the first they uttered, was only an imitation of the goats that had suckled them, and happened to be a Phrygian word signifying bread (b).\"\n\nWe have already said, that the Phrygians were superstitious; their idols were consequently very numerous. The chief of these was Cybele, who went by a variety of names. (See CYBELE.) They also worshipped Bacchus under the name of Sabazios; and his priests they called Saboi.\n\nThe history of their kings is dark and uncertain, and the dates of their several reigns and actions cannot now be fixed; we shall refer such of our readers, therefore, as wish to know what is certain respecting them, to the Ancient Universal History, already quoted more than once in the present article.

His mother apprized him of Ino's intentions upon his life; or, according to others, his preceptor; and the better to make his escape, he secured part of his father's treasures, and privately left Boeotia with his foster Helle, to go to their friend and relation \u00c6etes king of Colchis. They embarked on board a ship, or, as we are informed by the fabulous account of the poets and mythologists, they mounted on the back of a ram, whose fleece was of gold; and proceeded on their journey through the air. The height to which they were carried made Helle dizzy, and she fell into the sea. Phryxus gave his sister a decent burial on the sea-shore, and after he had called the place Hellepont from her name, he continued his flight, and arrived safe in the kingdom of \u00c6etes, where he offered the ram on the altars of Mars. The king received him with great tenderness, and gave him Chalciope his daughter in marriage. She had by him Phrontis Melas, Argos Cylindrus, whom some call Cytorus. He was afterwards murdered by his father-in-law, who envied him the possession of the golden fleece; and Chalciope, to prevent her children from sharing their father's fate, sent them privately from Colchis to Boeotia, as nothing was to be dreaded there from the jealousy or resentment of Ino, who was then dead. The fable of the flight of Phryxus to Colchis on a ram has been explained by some, who observe, that the ship on which he embarked was either called by that name, or carried on her prow a figure of that animal. The fleece of gold is accounted for, by observing that Phryxus carried away immense treasures from Thebes. Phryxus was placed among the constellations of heaven after death. The ram which carried him to Asia is said to have been the fruit of Neptune's amours with Theophane the daughter of Altis. This ram the gods had given to Athamas in order to reward his piety and religious life; and Nephele procured it for her.\n\n(b) Goropius Becanus makes use of the same argument, to prove that the High Dutch is the original or mother-tongue of the world, because the word *beker* in that language signifies \"a baker.\"","sp":21,"ep":21},{"h":"PHTHIRIASIS","t":"the Lousy Evil, from \u03c6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1, \"a louse.\" Children are frequently its subjects, but adults are sometimes troubled with it.

After some months of mutual tenderness and affection, Demophoon set sail for Athens, where his domestic affairs recalled him. He promised faithfully to return as soon as a month was expired; but either his dislike for Phyllis, or the irreparable situation of his affairs, obliged him to violate his engagement: and the queen, grown desperate on account of his absence, hanged herself, or, according to others, threw herself down a precipice into the sea and perished. Her friends raised a tomb over her body, where there grew up certain trees, whose leaves, at a particular season of the year, suddenly became wet as if shedding tears for the death of Phyllis.

It is the name of a science which occupied much of the attention of ancient philosophers, and which, since the revival of learning, has in a great degree been disfavored. Till of late it has seldom in modern times been mentioned, except in conjunction with the exploded arts of magic, alchemy, and judicial astrology. Within the last two centuries, no doubt, the bounds of human knowledge have been greatly extended by means of the patient pursuit of fact and experiment, instead of the hasty adoption of conjecture and hypotheses. We have certainly discovered many of the ancient systems to be merely creatures of imagination. Perhaps, however, in some instances, we have decided too rapidly, and rejected real knowledge, which we would have found it tedious and troublesome to acquire. Such has been the fate of the science of physiognomy; which certainly merits to be considered in a light very different from alchemy and those other fanciful studies with which it had accidentally been coupled. The work lately published by M. Lavater on the subject has indeed excited attention, and may perhaps tend to replace physiognomy in that rank in the circle of the sciences to which it seems to be intitled.\n\nIt does not appear that the ancients extended the compass of physiognomy beyond man, or at least animated nature; But the study of that art was revived in the middle ages, when, misled probably by the comprehensiveness of the etymological meaning of the word, or incited by the prevalent taste for the marvellous, those who treated of the subject stretched the range of their speculation far beyond the ancient limits. The extension of the signification of the term was adopted universally by those naturalists who admitted the theory of signatures (see SIGNATURE); and physiognomy came thus to mean, the knowledge of the internal properties of any corporeal existence from the external appearances. Joannes Baptista Porta, for instance, who was a physiognomist and philosopher of considerable eminence, wrote a treatise on the physiognomy of plants (physiognomica), in which he employs physiognomy as the generic term. There is a treatise likewise De Physiognomia Animalium, written we believe by the same person. In the Magia Physiognomica of Galpar Schottus, physiognomia humana is made a subdivision of the science.\n\nBoyle too adopts the extensive signification mentioned, which indeed seems to have been at one time the usual acceptation of the word (A). At present physiognomy seems to mean no more than \"a knowledge of the moral character and extent of intellectual powers of human beings, from their external appearance and manners.\" In the Berlin Transactions for the years 1769 and 1770 there appears a long controversial discussion on the subject of the definition of physiognomy between M. Pernety and M. Le Cat, two modern authors of some note. Pernety contends that all knowledge whatever is physiognomy; Le Cat confines the subject to the human face. Neither seems to have hit the medium of truth. Soon after the celebrated book of Lavater appeared. He indeed defines physiognomy to be, \"the art of discovering the interior of man by means of his exterior;\" but in different passages of his work he evidently favours the extended signification of Pernety. This work gave occasion to M. Formey's attack upon the science itself in the same Berlin Transactions for 1775. Formey strenuously controverts the extent assigned by Lavater to his favorite science.\n\nBefore the era of Pythagoras the Greeks had little or Pythagoras no science, and of course could not be scientifical physiognomists. Physiognomy, however, was much cultivated in Egypt and India; and from these countries the science spread to Greece.\n\n(A) They'll find i' the physiognomies O' th' planets all men's destinies. HUDIBRAS.\npage of Samos probably introduced the rudiments of this science; as he did those of many others, generally deemed more important, into Greece.\n\nIn the time of Socrates it appears even to have been adopted as a profession. Of this the well-known anecdote of the decision of Zopyrus, on the real character of Socrates himself, judging from his countenance, is sufficient evidence. Plato mentions the subject; and by Aristotle it is formally treated of in a book allotted to the purpose.\n\nIt may be worth while to give a brief outline of Aristotle's sentiments on the subject.\n\nPhysiognomy, he in substance observes, had been treated of in three ways: Some philosophers classified animals into genera, and ascribed to each genus a certain mental disposition corresponding to their corporeal appearance. Others made a farther distinction of dividing the genera into species. Among men, for instance, they distinguished the Thracians, the Scythians, the Egyptians, and whatever nations were strikingly different in manners and habits, to whom accordingly they assigned the distinctive physiognomical characteristics. A third set of physiognomists judged of the actions and manners of the individual, and presumed that certain manners proceeded from certain dispositions. But the method of treating the subject adopted by Aristotle himself was this: A peculiar form of body is invariably accompanied by a peculiar disposition of mind; a human intellect is never found in the corporeal form of a beast. The mind and body reciprocally affect each other: thus in intoxication and mania the mind exhibits the affections of the body; and in fear, joy, &c., the body displays the affections of the mind.\n\nFrom such facts he argues, that when in man a particular bodily character appears, which by prior experience and observation has been found uniformly accompanied by a certain mental disposition, with which therefore it must have been necessarily connected; we are intitled in all such cases to infer the disposition from the appearance. Our observations, he conceives, may be drawn from other animals as well as from men: for as a lion possesses one bodily form and mental character, a hare another, the corporeal characteristics of the lion, such as strong hair, deep voice, large extremities, discernible in a human creature, denote the strength and courage of that noble animal; while the slender extremities, feet down, and other features of the hare, visible in a man, betray the mental character of that pusillanimous creature.\n\nUpon this principle Aristotle treats of the corporeal features of man, and the correspondent dispositions, so far as observed: he illustrates them by the analogy just mentioned, and in some instances attempts to account for them by physiological reasoning.\n\nAt the early period in which Aristotle wrote, his theory, plausible certainly, and even probable, displays his usual penetration and a considerable degree of knowledge. He distinctly notices individual physiognomy, national physiognomy, and comparative physiognomy. The state of knowledge in his time did not admit of a complete elucidation of his general principles; on that account his enumeration of particular observations and precepts is by no means so well founded or so accurate as his method of study. Even his style, concise and energetic, was inimical to the subject; which, to be made clearly comprehensible, must require frequent paraphrases. Aristotle's performance, however, such as it is, has been taken as the groundwork and model of every physiognomical treatise that has since appeared.\n\nThe imitators of this great man in the 16th and 17th centuries have even copied his language and manner, which areentious, indiscriminate, and obscure. His comparative physiognomy of men with beasts has been frequently though not universally adopted. Besides his treatise expressly on the subject, many incidental observations on physiognomy will be found interposed through his other works, particularly in his history of animals.\n\nNext after Aristotle, his disciple and successor Theophrastus would deserve to be particularly mentioned as an ethicist as a writer on the subject in question. His ethical characters, a singular and entertaining performance, composed at the age of 99, form a distinct treatise on a branch of most important branch of physiognomy, the physiognomy of manners: but the translations and imitations of Laumy, Bruyere, are so excellent, that by referring to them we do greater justice than would otherwise be in our power, both to Theophrastus and to our readers. We cannot, however, omit observing, that the accuracy of observation and liveliness of description displayed in the work of Theophrastus will preserve it high in classical rank, while the science of man and the prominent characteristics of human society continue to be objects of attention.\n\nPolemon of Athens, Adamantius the sophist, and several others, wrote on the subject about the same period. Lately there was published a collection of all the authors on Greek authors on physiognomy: the book is entitled Physiognomiae veteris scriptores Graeci, Gr. et Lat. Francisci Altenb. 1782, 8vo. From the number of these authors, it appears that the science was much cultivated in Greece; but the professors seem soon to have connected with it something of the marvellous. This we have from some cause to suspect from the story told by Apion of Alexandria, the marvellous thing of the day: Imaginem adeo similitudinis indicietem pinxit, ut (incredibile dictu) Apion Grammaticus Scriptum reliquerit quemdam ex facie hominum ad divinationem (quos melapof, copos vocant) ex illis dixisse aut futurae mortis annori, aut pretenderet*. The novices of the Pythagorean school were subjected to the physiognomic observation of their teachers, and it is probable the first physiognomists by lib. 35, profession among the Greeks were of this sect. They, \u00a7 35, par., too, to whom, from the nature of their doctrines and discipline, mystery was familiar, were the first, it is likely, who exposed the science of physiognomy in Greece to disgrace, by blending with it the art of divination.\n\nFrom the period of which we have been treating to the close of the Roman republic, nothing worthy of notice occurs in the literary history of physiognomy. About the last mentioned era, however, and from thence to the decline of the empire under the later emperors, the science appears to have been cultivated as an important branch of erudition, and assumed as a profession by persons who had acquired a superior knowledge in it.\n\nIn the works of Hippocrates and Galen, many physiognomical observations occur. Cicero appears to have been peculiarly attached to the science. In his oration...\ntion against Piso, and in that in favour of Rofcius, the reader will at the same time perceive in what manner the orator employs phylognomy to his purposes, and find a curious instance of the ancient manner of oratorical abuse.\n\nMany phylognomic remarks are to be found likewise in the writings of Sallust, Suetonius, Seneca, Pliny, Aulus Gellius, Petronius, Plutarch, and others.\n\nThat in the Roman empire the science was practised as a profession, ample evidence appears in the writings of several of the authors just mentioned. Suetonius, for instance, in his Life of Titus, mentions that Narcissus employed a physiognomist to examine the features of Britannicus, who predicted that Britannicus would not succeed, but that the empire would devolve on Titus.\n\nThe science of phylognomy shared the same fate with all others, when the Roman empire was overthrown by the northern barbarians. About the beginning of the 16th century it began again to be noticed.\u2014From that time till the close of the 17th, it was one of the most fashionable studies. Within that space have appeared almost all the approved modern authors on the subject (B).\n\nIt has been unfortunate for phylognomy, that by many of these writers it was held to be connected with doctrines of which the philosophy of the present day would be ashamed. With these doctrines it had almost sunk into oblivion.\n\nIn every period of the history of literature there may be marked a prevalence of particular studies. In the early period, for instance, of Grecian literature, mythological morality claimed the chief attention of the philosophers. In the more advanced state of learning in Greece and in Rome, poetry, history, and oratory, held the pre-eminence. Under the latter emperors, and for some time afterwards, the history of theological controversies occupied the greatest part of works of the learned. Next succeeded metaphysics, and metaphysical theology. These gave place to alchemy, magic, judicial astrology, the doctrine of signatures and sympathies, the mystic, theosophic, and Rosicrucian theology, with phylognomy. Such were the pursuits contemporary with the science which is the object of our present inquiry. It is no matter of surprise, that, so associated, it should have fallen into contempt. It is not unusual for mankind hastily to reject valuable opinions, when accidentally or artificially connected with others which are absurd and untenable. Of the truth of this remark, the history of theology, and the present tone of theological opinions in Europe, furnish a pregnant example.\n\nTo phylognomy, and the exploded sciences last mentioned, succeeded clastic philology; which gave place to modern poetry and natural philosophy; to which recently have been added the studies of rational theology, chro-\n\n(B) They are, Bartholem. Cocles, Baptista Porta, Honoratus Nuquetius, Jacobus de Indagine, Alstedius, Michael Schottus, Gaetar Schottus, Cardan, Talhierus, Fludd, Behmen, Barclay, Claromontius, Conringius, the commentaries of Augustin Niphus, and Camillus Balbus on the Physiognomica of Aristotle,\u2014Spontanus, Andreas Henricus, Joannes Digandar, Rud.

Lavater professes not to give a complete synthetical treatise on physiognomy, but, aware that the science is yet in its infancy, he exhibits fragments only, illustrative of its different parts. His performance is no doubt delusory and unconnected. It contains, however, many particulars much superior to anything that had ever before appeared on the subject.\n\nWith the scholastic and systematic method adopted by the physiognomists of the last and preceding centuries, Lavater has rejected their manner of writing, which was dry, concise, indeterminate, and general: His remarks, on the contrary, are, for the most part, precise and particular, frequently founded on distinctions extremely acute. He has omitted entirely (as was to be expected from a writer of the present day) the astrological reveries, and such like, which deform the writings of former physiognomists; and he has with much propriety deduced his physiognomical observations but seldom from anatomical or physiological reasoning. Such reasoning may perhaps at some future period become important; but at present our knowledge of facts, although extensive, is not so universal, as to become the stable foundation of particular deductions. Lavater has illustrated his remarks by engravings; a method first adopted by Baptista Porta.\u2014Lavater's engravings are very numerous, often expressive, and tolerably executed.\n\nThe opinions of this celebrated physiognomist are evidently the result of actual observation. He appears indeed to have made the science his peculiar study, and the grand pursuit of his life. His performance exhibits an extended comprehension of the subject, by a particular attention to official physiognomy, and the effect of profiles and contours. His style in general is forcible and lively, although somewhat declamatory and digressive. His expressions are frequently precise, and strikingly characteristic; and the spirit of piety and benevolence which pervade the whole performance render it highly interesting.\n\nThe defects of the work, however, detract much from the weight which Lavater's opinions might otherwise challenge. His imagination has frequently so far outstript his judgement, that an ordinary reader would often be apt to reject the whole system as the extravagant reverie of an ingenious theorist. He has clothed his favourite science in that affected mysterious air of importance, which was so usual with his predecessors, and describes the whole material world to be objects of the universal dominion of physiognomy*. He whimsically conceives it necessary for a physiognomist to be a well-shaped handsome man\u2020. He employs a language which is often much too peremptory and decisive, disproportionate to the real subsistence of his remarks, or to the occasion of making them. The remarks themselves are frequently opposite in appearance to common observation, and yet unsupported by any illustrations of his.\n\nLavater certainly errs in placing too great a reliance on single features, as the foundation of decision on character. His opinions on the physiognomy of the ears, hands, nails, and feet of the human species, on handwriting, on the physiognomy of birds, insects, reptiles, and fishes, are obviously premature, as hitherto no sufficient number of accurate observations have been made, in regard to either of these particulars, to authorise any conclusion. He has erred in the opposite extreme, when treating of the important topic of national physiognomy, where he has by no means prosecuted the subject so far as facts might have warranted. We must farther take the liberty to object to the frequent introduction of the author's own physiognomy throughout the course of his work. His singular remarks on his own face do not serve to prejudice the reader in favour of his judgement, however much his character may justify the truth of them. We must regret likewise, for the credit of the science, that the author's singularly fanciful theory of apparitions should so nearly resemble a revival of the antiquated opinions of the sympathists.\n\nTo these blemishes, which we have reluctantly enumerated, perhaps may be added that high impassioned tone of enthusiasm in favour of his science everywhere displayed throughout the work of this author, which is certainly very opposite to the cool patient investigation befitting philosophy. To that enthusiasm, however, it is probable that in this instance (as is, indeed, no unfrequent effect of enthusiasm) we are indebted for the excellency which the author has attained in his pursuit; and it poetifies the salutary tendency of putting us on our guard against a too implicit acquiescence in his physiological decisions.\n\nIn the Berlin Transactions for 1775, there appears a formal attack upon Lavater's work by M. Formey, was attacked. This essay we have already mentioned. After disputing on the propriety of the extensive signification applied by Britain Lavater and Permetty to the term physiognomy, M. Formey adopts nearly the same definition which we conceive to be the most proper, and which we have put down as such near the beginning of this article. He allows that the mental character is intimately connected with, and visibly influenced by, every fibre of the body; but his principal argument against physiognomy is, that the human frame is liable to innumerable accidents, by which it may be changed in its external appearance, without any correspondent change of the disposition; so that it surpasses the extent of the skill of mortals to distinguish the modifications of feature that are natural, from those which may be accidental. Although, therefore, the science of physiognomy may be founded in truth, he infers that the deity only can exercise it.\n\nM. Formey further contends, that education, diet, climate, and sudden emotions, nay even the temperaments of ancestors, affect the cast of human features; so that the influence of mental character on these features may be so involved with, or hidden by, accidental circumstances, that the study of physiognomy must ever be attended by hopeless uncertainty. These objections are worthy of notice, but they are by no means conclusive.\n\nWe shall give a specimen of M. Lavater's manner of treating the subject on the opposite side of the question: A specimen, not in Lavater's precise words, but conveying more shortly an idea at once of his sentiments, and of his manner of expressing them.\n\nNo study, says he, excepting mathematics, more justly deserves to be termed a science than physiognomy. It is a department of physics, including theology and edified belles lettres, and in the same manner with these sciences ence.\nmay be reduced to rule. It may acquire a fixed and appropriate character: It may be communicated and taught.\n\nTruth or knowledge, explained by fixed principles, becomes science. Words, lines, rules, definitions, are the medium of communication. The question, then, with respect to phsyognomy, will thus be fairly stated. Can the striking and marked differences which are visible between one human face, one human form, and another, be explained, not by obscure and confused conceptions, but by certain characters, signs, and expressions? Are these signs capable of communicating the vigour or imbecility, the sickness or health, of the body; the wisdom, the folly, the magnanimity, the meanness, the virtue, or the vice, of the mind?\n\nIt is only to a certain extent that even the experimental philosopher can pursue his researches. The active and vigorous mind, employed in such studies, will often form conceptions which he shall be incapable of expressing in words, so as to communicate his ideas to the feeblest mind, which was itself unable to make the discovery: But the lofty, the exalted mind, which soars beyond all written rule, which possesses feelings and energies reducible to no law, must be pronounced unscientific.\n\nIt will be admitted, then, that to a certain degree phsyognomical truth may as a science be defined and communicated. Of the truth of the science there cannot exist a doubt. Every countenance, every form, every created existence, is individually different, as well as different, in respect of class, race, and kind. No one being in nature is precisely similar to another. This proposition, in so far as regards man, is the foundation-stone of phsyognomy. There may exist an intimate analogy, a striking similarity, between two men, who yet being brought together, and accurately compared, will appear to be remarkably different. No two minds perfectly resemble each other. Now, is it possible to doubt that there must be a certain native analogy between the external varieties of countenance and form and the internal varieties of the mind? By anger the muscles are rendered protuberant: Are not, then, the angry mind, and the protuberant muscles, as cause and effect? The man of acute wit has frequently a quick and lively eye. Is it possible to resist the conclusion, that between such a mind and such a countenance there is a determinate relation?\n\nEvery thing in nature is estimated by its phsyognomy; that is, its external appearance. The trader judges by the colour, the fineness, the exterior, the phsyognomy of every article of traffic; and he at once decides that the buyer \"has an honest look,\" or \"a pleasing or forbidding countenance.\"\n\nThat knowledge and science are detrimental to man, that a state of rudeness and ignorance are preferable and productive of more happiness, are tenets now deservedly exploded. They do not merit serious opposition. The extension and increase of knowledge, then, is an object of importance to man: And what object can be so important as the knowledge of man himself? If knowledge can influence his happiness, the knowledge of himself must influence it the most. This useful knowledge is the peculiar province of the science of phsyognomy. To conceive a just idea of the advantages of phsyognomy, let us for a moment suppose that all phsyognomical knowledge were totally forgotten among men; what confusion, what uncertainty, what numberless mistakes, would be the consequence? Men destined to live in society must hold mutual intercourse. The knowledge of man imparts to this intercourse its spirit, its pleasures, its advantages.\n\nPhsyognomy is a source of pure and exalted mental gratification. It affords a new view of the perfection of great men; it displays a new scene of harmony and beauty in his works; it reveals internal motives, which without it would only have been discovered in the world to come. The phsyognomist distinguishes accurately the permanent from the habitual, the habitual from the accidental, in character. Difficulties, no doubt, attend the study of this science. The most minute shades, scarcely discernible to the unexperienced eye, denote often total opposition of character. A small inflexion, diminution, lengthening or sharpening, even though but of a hair's-breadth, may alter in an astonishing degree the expression of countenance and character. How difficult then, how impossible indeed, must this variety of the same countenance render precision? The feet of character is often so hidden, so masked, that it can only be detected in certain, perhaps uncommon, positions of countenance. These positions may be so quickly changed, the signs may so instantaneously disappear, and their impression on the mind of the observer may be so slight, or these distinguishing traits themselves so difficult to seize, that it shall be impossible to paint them or describe them in language. Innumerable great and small accidents, whether physical or moral, various incidents and passions, the diversity of dress, of position, of light or shade, tend to display the countenance often in so disadvantageous a point of view, that the phsyognomist is betrayed into an erroneous judgement of the true qualities of the countenance and character. Such causes often occasion him to overlook the essential traits of character, and to form a decision on what is purely accidental.\u2014How surprisingly, for instance, may the smallpox disfigure the countenance, and destroy or confound, or render imperceptible, traits otherwise the most decisive?\n\nWe shall, then, continues Lavater, grant to the opponent of phsyognomy all he can ask; and yet we do not deny the existence of hopes that many of the difficulties shall be visited, resolved which at first appeared inexplicable.\n\nHe then proceeds to a specific illustration of his subject under a great variety of titles, in which he treats of Lavater's human nature in general, and of each particular feature separately.\n\nTo enumerate the different divisions of his book would not be more satisfactory to our readers than the perusal of the contents of the book itself; and an attempt to epitomize even the essential substance of the vast multiplicity of matter contained in his essays, (which are yet only fragments, and to which indeed he himself does not pretend to give any higher appellation), would extend this article to a disproportionate length. Such an abridgement, after all, would convey no solid information on a subject which merits all the time and study that an attentive perusal of Lavater's works at large would require.\n\nFrom the historical deduction of the literary progress of phsyognomy which we have thus attempted to lay before our readers, it appears, that although the science which this has fallen into disrepute, there can scarcely be mentioned as having fallen.\ned a period in which any cultivation of science took place when physiognomy was not likewise the study, nay sometimes even the profession, of men of the most eminent abilities and the greatest learning.\n\nThe reasons why at present so little attention is paid to the subject probably are,\n\n1st, That it has been treated in conjunction with subjects now with propriety exploded: And,\n\n2dly, That it has been injured by the injudicious assertions and arguments of those who have undertaken its defence.\n\nSometimes, however, the wise and the learned may err. The use of anything must not be rejected for no better reason than that it is capable of abuse. Perhaps the era is not distant when physiognomy shall be reinstated in the rank which she merits among the valuable branches of human knowledge, and be studied with that degree of attention and perseverance which a subject deserves so essentially connected with the science of man.\n\nThat there is an intimate relation between the dispositions of the mind and the features of the countenance is a fact which cannot be questioned. He who is sunk under a load of grief for the death of an affectionate wife or a dutiful child, has very different cast of features from the man who is happy in the prospect of meeting his mistress. A person boiling with anger has a threatening air in his countenance, which the most heedless observer never mistakes; and if any particular disposition be indulged till it become habitual, there cannot be a doubt but that the corresponding traces will be so fixed in the face as to be discernible by the skilful physiognomist, under every effort made to disguise them. But when we attempt to decide on a man's intellectual powers by the rules of this science, we are often deceived; and in this respect we have reason to believe that Lavater himself has fallen into the grossest mistakes.\n\nConnected with physiognomy, we may consider the craniometric system of Dr Gall of Vienna, which is so called, because, from the exterior form of the cranium, he infers the powers and dispositions of the mind. The brain, he observes, is the material organ of the action of the mind; and as it increases in direct proportion to the faculties of animals, he has endeavoured to prove, that the faculties are distinct and independent on each other; that each has its proper material organ, and that the expansion of the organ is in proportion to the strength of the faculty. This system is attempted to be established by the following reasoning.\n\n\"The internal faculties, (says Dr Bojanus, the author of a view of this system), do not always exist in the same proportion to each other. There are some men who have a great deal of genius without having a memory, who have courage without circumspection, and who possess a metaphysical spirit without being good observers.\n\nBesides, the phenomena of dreaming, of somnambulism, of delirium, &c., prove to us that the internal faculties do not always act together; that there is often a very great activity of one, while the rest are not sensible.\n\nThus, in old age, and sometimes in disease, such, for example as madness, several faculties are lost, while others subsist; besides, a continued employment of the same faculty sensibly diminishes its energy: If we employ another, we find it has all the force of which it is susceptible; and if we return to the former faculty, it is observed that it has resumed its usual vigour. It is thus that, when fatigued with reading an abstract philosophical work, we proceed with pleasure to a poetical one, and then resume with the same attention our former occupation.\"\n\n\"All these phenomena prove that the faculties are distinct and independent of each other, and we are inclined to believe that the case is the same with their material organs.\"\n\n\"We do not entirely agree with this idea of Dr Gall, and we believe, on the contrary, that the separation of the material organs ought to be considered as the cause of the division of the internal faculties. It appears, to us at least, that by supposing the faculties themselves as originally separated, we cannot save ourselves from falling into materialism, which exists when the mind is no longer considered as unity.\"\n\n\"The expansion of the organs contained in the cranium is in the direct ratio of the force of their corresponding faculties.\"\n\n\"This principle, dictated by analogy, rests on this axiom, that throughout all nature the faculties are always found to be proportioned to their relative organs; and the truth of it is proved in a special manner by the particular observations of Dr Gall.\n\n\"It is however to be remarked, that exercise has a great influence on the force of the faculties, and that an organ moderately expanded, but often exercised, can give a faculty superior to that which accompanies a very extensive organ never put in action; as we see that a man of a weak conformation acquires, by continued exercise, strength superior to another of a more athletic structure.\"\n\n\"We must here mention an opinion which seems to result immediately from this principle, and which, however, is false: It is, that the volume of the brain, in general, is in the direct ratio of the energy of its faculties. Observation has proved to Dr Gall, that we cannot judge of the strength of the faculties but by the development of the separate organs which form distinct eminences in the cranium; and that a cranium perfectly round, of whatever size it may be, is never a proof of many or of great faculties.\n\n\"We do not recollect to have heard the reason assigned by Dr Gall; but, in our opinion, these brains may be considered as in a state analogous to obesity; and as we do not judge of the muscular force of a man or an animal by the volume of their members, but by the development of the muscles in particular, one would think we ought, in like manner, to judge of the strength of the faculties by the development of the relative organs.\n\n\"In the last place, the 4th principle, the most important for practice in regard to the system of Dr Gall, is:\n\n\"We may judge of these different organs and of their faculties by the exterior form of the cranium.\n\n\"The truth of this principle is founded upon another, viz. that the conformation of the cranium depends on that of the brain; a truth generally acknowledged, and proved by the anterior part of the brain, by the impressions in the anterior part of the cranium, and by other facts.\n\n[There are skulls, it is true, in which an external protuberance","sp":44,"ep":50},{"h":"PHYSIOGNOMY","t":"protuberance of the bone corresponds to an interior one; and this irregularity, which is found sometimes as a dif-\nficult, and most commonly at an advanced age, when the cerebral organs do not oppose the same resistance to the\ncranium, renders the practice of Dr Gall's system, in some measure, uncertain.]\n\n\"Guided by these principles, Dr Gall examines the nature of the skull, compares the crania of animals and those of men analogous and different in faculties. His researches have proved to him, in a manner almost incontestable, not only the above truths, but that the faculties of animals are analogous to those of man; that what we call instinct in animals is found also in the latter, such as attachment, cunning, circumcision, courage, &c.; that the quantity of the organs fixes the difference of the genus of animals, their reciprocal proportion that of individuals; that the disposition originally given to each faculty by nature may be called forth by exercise and favourable circumstances, and sometimes by disease, but that it never can be created in the case where it has not been given by nature (c); that the accumulation of the organs takes place in a constant manner from the hind part forwards, from the bottom to the top, in such a manner, that animals in proportion as they approach man in the quantity of their faculties have the superior and anterior part of the brain more expanded; and, in the last place, that in the most perfect animal, man, there are organs in the anterior and superior parts of the frontal bone, and of the parietals, destined for faculties which belong to them exclusively. It is under the latter point of view that the discoveries of Dr Gall agree perfectly with the theory of the facial angle, which seems still further to establish the truth of them.\"\n\nMost of our readers will probably be satisfied with the short view which we have now given of this fanciful and visionary system; but such as wish for a fuller exposition of it, may consult the Philosophical Magazine, vol. xiv., p. 77, from which the above is extracted. We shall only add the names of a few of the organs, which the author of the system thinks he has discovered. Organ of the tenacity of life. Organ of music. Organ of fighting. Organ of murder. Organ of cunning. Organ of arithmetic. Organ of thieving, &c.","sp":50,"ep":51},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"INTRODUCTION.\n\n1. Physiology is that part of physical science which treats of the nature, properties, and functions of living bodies; comprehending under this term, animals and vegetables. The word is derived from \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \"nature,\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \"a discourse;\" and signified originally what we may call natural knowledge.\n\nThe object of this science is to examine and compare the phenomena of life; to discover the properties, powers, and operations of the bodies that are actuated by this principle, and to pursue the development, progress, and decay of vital energy, from brute matter, which possesses no portion of vitality, to the most perfect animal, which seems to have it in the greatest perfection.\n\n2. Physiology may be considered under three heads; historical, philosophical or rational, and practical physiology.\n\n3. Historical physiology is occupied in giving a simple relation of the facts and phenomena that take place in living bodies; in bringing them together, and comparing those which succeed each other without interruption during the existence of vitality.\n\n4. It is the business of philosophical physiology to consider the nature of these phenomena, and endeavour to deduce from them some general conclusions, by which they may be explained or elucidated; to draw from them natural consequences, and unfold successively their analogies and relations; to arrange, distribute, and classify them, and thus acquire sufficient data by which to discover the causes which produce them.\n\nThe practical part of physiology is intended to point out the application of the principles of the science to the useful purposes of life, especially to medicine and agriculture. Of these divisions the first is the most important, as, until we have acquired a pretty complete knowledge of the facts relating to living beings, and arranged these in a natural manner, it cannot be expected that we should make any great progress in explaining them, or investigating their causes. From the multitude, variety, and complex nature of these phenomena, a complete view of them is extremely difficult, and requires the united efforts of genius, dexterity, patience, and discernment.\n\nPhysiology is intimately related to several other departments of natural knowledge. Its relation to anatomy is the most strict and natural; and indeed the knowledge of the structure of living bodies is a necessary introduction to that of their properties and functions. So close is the union between these two sciences, that it is generally thought that the study of them should go hand in hand. Certain it is, that, without physiology, anatomy is a dry and uninteresting study; while, on the other hand, physiology, unaided by anatomy, is obscure and uncertain. It is by means of anatomy that we learn the structure and organization of the animal machine; the disposition and form of its several members; the parts that concur in the composition of them; the arrangement and the connection of these: it is by means of anatomy that we know how to estimate the advantages\n\n(c) The germ of every organ must exist in embryo, if the expansion of that organ is to be afterwards called forth.","sp":51,"ep":51},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Whenever the economy of living bodies indicates design, and cannot result from any combination or structure of organs, it must be supposed the effect of something different from matter, and whose explanation belongs to that science which is called metaphysics, or which we might term the philosophy of the mind. By ascribing, indeed, to the glandular contents within the cranium, and to that fiction animal spirits, the motives of action, the superficial and ill-informed may have been led to an opinion that perception, memory, and imagination, are the functions of the cerebrum, the medulla oblongata, and cerebellum; that the soul is a consequence of organization; and the science which treats of it only a particular branch of physiology. But mind and its faculties are now so well understood and investigated, that this opinion can seldom prevail but where penetration is not remarkable for its acuteness, or where reflection, reading, and research, have long been confined within the limits of a narrow circle.\n\nSome metaphysical physiologists contend, that every living system of organs supposes mind, and indeed in the study of such systems the physiologist must often meet with many phenomena that are less singular than simple perception, and yet for which he cannot account by any knowledge he possesses of organic powers. This truth we partly acknowledge, when, like ancient Athens erecting her altars to unknown gods, we retreat to those asylum of ignorance, the vis insita, the vis nervosa, the vis vitalis, the vis medicatrix, and a number of others of the same kind.\n\nPhysiology, in the general sense in which we have and natural defined it, is a science that investigates the nature and history, the functions of all living beings. It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that it must have an intimate connection with natural history, and in fact, it is to this branch of physics that it has been perhaps more indebted than to any other. A comparative view of the various gradations among organized beings has taught us to appreciate the value of the several functions that characterize vitality, and has shewn us, that in proportion as the structure is more complex, the functions are more numerous, and more complete. Repeated observations, and multiplied experiments on various tribes of animated nature have cleared up many doubtful and obscure phenomena in the economy of man, and a continuation of this truly philosophical method of research promises to place physiology on the solid basis of experience, and enable us to reason, where only we can reason with safety, by a deduction from facts. The more numerous these facts, and the more complete their arrangement, the more extensive, and the more secure will be the foundation which they afford for physiological conclusions. In short (to use the language of Dumas, who has illustrated this relation at great length), \"the physiologist who is conversant with natural history, is so much the better fortified against uncertain opinions inasmuch as he has more fully observed the operations of nature in connection and in detail. An hypothesis which to others appears perfectly adequate to the object in view, is not convincing to him. He rises above the particular object to which it is accommodated, in order to appreciate its value; and it is often among circumstances which are foreign to the original subject, that he seeks for exceptions or contradictions that overturn the hypothesis. Every thing that may serve to complete the knowledge...\"\nknowledge of the animal economy enters into his plan; and as the nature of man is so much the less comprehensible as we employ a greater number of comparative ideas in its exposition, it is doubtless in the power of natural history to elucidate that subject, by revealing a multitude of unknown relations between man and those beings which resemble or which differ from him.*\n\nThe importance and utility of physiology will scarcely be questioned, and need therefore but little illustration. To all who desire to become acquainted with the operations that take place in the animal economy, or to trace the progress of vegetation, and examine the various changes produced on the seed or bud from the action of air, heat, and moisture, (and what studies can be more deserving of a rational and an enlightened mind?) physiology must afford the most interesting subjects of contemplation. To the anatomist and the botanist, it relieves the tedium of dry description and severe classification; to the physician it holds out the surest lights to direct his researches into the circumstances that are favourable to life and health, into the nature and phenomena of death, and of course, the means of avoiding or delaying its attack; to the agriculturist it furnishes some of the most certain principles to direct him (with the aid of chemistry) in the choice of soils, and the application of manures; while to the genuine naturalist, no subject presents such a field of amusement and instruction. When it shall have been rendered as complete as the state of contemporary science will allow, it will exhibit the general result of all those experiments and observations that have purposely been made to illustrate the phenomena of animated matter, or have accidentally contributed to that illustration; and when it shall reach that summit of perfection to which the efforts of genius may carry it, it may diffuse a light, of which at the present day we can form no just or adequate conception.\n\nOn many occasions it may introduce order for confusion, certainty for doubt; and may establish science, in various departments that are now occupied by fancy and conjecture.\n\nAfter having pointed out the nature, division, relations, and utility of physiology, it may not be improper to make a few remarks on the best methods of pursuing the study of it, and the works that are most worthy of a perusal.\n\nFrom what has been said of the relations between physiology and other sciences, it will be inferred that the student of our present subject should come prepared with a moderate share of knowledge in anatomy, both human and comparative, of chemistry, of mechanical philosophy, especially dynamics, optics, pneumatics, and acoustics; and natural history, especially zoology and botany. At least the rudiments of these branches should be well understood, and the student will then have laid a foundation on which to raise a firm and durable superstructure.\n\nHe has now to make himself acquainted with what is already known; and in this inquiry it is of much consequence that he should select those works that embrace the whole subject, without being too diffuse on the one hand or too brief and general on the other. The Elements Physiologiques of Haller contains a mass of information that will ever render it valuable as a book of reference, though it will scarcely at the present day be studied as a system of physiology. His Prime Lineae Physiologiae, though first written, is chiefly a compendium of the larger work, and is better adapted to the general student, though, from its not containing the later discoveries in the science, it is far from complete. The Influentiae Physiologicae of Blumenbach is a useful work, though it has now given place to the later and more accurate publications of Cuvier and Dumas. The Anatomie Comparee of the former writer contains an excellent digest of comparative physiology, and the preliminary observations prefixed to the anatomical details contained in this work, may be read with considerable advantage. Probably, however, the Principes de Physiologie of Dumas is the most perfect and scientific modern production that has appeared on the subject. We cannot say so much of the Elements of Physiology lately published by Richrand, and translated into English by Mr Kernion; for although it contains considerable information, and a great display of reading, and even of original observation and experiment, it is neither scientific nor always very accurate. The works of Bichat, especially his Anatomie Generale, Anatomie Descriptive, and his Recherches Physiologiques sur la Vie et la Mort, abound with excellent physiological remarks, and allowing for the great extent to which he has carried some peculiar doctrines, are among the best that have appeared on the animal economy.\n\nIn our own country, we have many valuable treatises and papers on different parts of physiology, and the names of Hunter, Monro, Home, Cooper, Abernethy, Carlisle, Sanders, Barclay, Jones, and many others, will ever reflect honour on the country and on the age in which they lived. We can scarcely, however, point out a complete work in our language on the general subject of physiology, though we doubt not that many will be disposed to confide the Zoonomia of Dr Darwin as entitled to that appellation. We allow that this is a stupendous monument of the genius and industry of its author, and it contains an ample store of valuable facts, which, if they could be divested of the hypothesis with which they are to much blended, would be extremely useful to the cause of physiological science. At present many of them tend to mislead, by a shew of metaphysical acuteness, and by the new fashions in which several terms are employed. Another of Dr Darwin's works, not less valuable, in a physiological point of view, is his Physiologia, in which he treats of the economy of vegetation with ability and success.\n\nHe who is desirous of advancing and improving the Means of science of physiology, must, in the first place, have re-advancing course to a patient, and, as far as may be, an accurate and impartial observation of the phenomena that take place in organized beings; but the multitude, the variety, and complicated nature of these phenomena, place in his way obstructions that it is difficult to surmount. It is only through time, and patience, and assiduity, that he can attain his object; and it requires considerable dexterity and acuteness to detect the appearances under which these phenomena sometimes present themselves, to pierce through the obscurity in which they are often involved, and to avoid, in a route so uncertain, both the illusions of fashion and the errors of genius. The living body has properties peculiar to itself, while it also possesses others that are common to it with brute matter. The phenomena by which it manifests these two orders of properties, are therefore of two kinds, as they relate particu-","sp":51,"ep":53},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Introduction.\n\nlarly to the state of vitality, and as they are found in every object that exists. These latter are subject to the general laws of matter, are confounded with the phenomena of universal nature, and may be denominated physical phenomena. Among the former, some are confined to the arrangement or disposition of the parts in organs, and depend on the structure or form of these organs. These may be called organic phenomena. Others depend on the particular laws that govern vital beings, and are not the result of any peculiar organization; these are vital phenomena.\n\nObservation alone is sufficient to indicate the presence or the existence of these phenomena; but to unveil them fully there is required an unceasing attention, that is resolved to pursue them through the changes produced by age, sex, climate, situation, and all those circumstances that can affect the living system.\n\nTo observation, he must add, wherever this can be done with a chance of accuracy, a patient investigation of nature by experiment. From the experiments of Spallanzani and Stevens on digestion; of Goodwin, Menzies, Spallanzani, and Davy on respiration; of Monro, Galvani, Volta, and a hundred others on animal irritability, with many other experiments made both at home and abroad, more light has been thrown on the economy of living bodies, than by all the hypotheses and theories that the most ingenious speculators have contrived since the first dawn of infant science.\n\nIn following out Bacon's great plan of observation and experiment, we must, however, take care in physiological, as in all other physical inquiries, not to be too hasty in our conclusions, and not to suppose that we have reached the bottom of the well of truth, when we have barely got within its verge. Further observations on this subject are unnecessary here, as we have already treated it at some length in the articles PHILOSOPHY and PHYSICS.\n\nWe shall conclude these introductory remarks with a brief sketch of the principal arrangements of modern physiologists, and a tabular outline of the subject as we propose to treat it in the following pages.\n\nThere are two modes of arrangement that have usually been adopted in treating physiology; one according to the order of the functions, and another according to that of the organs by which these are performed. The latter of these was adopted by Haller; the former is that of Dumas, Cuvier, and most of our later physiologists.\n\nDumas, after a long introductory discourse, in which he treats of the best method of pursuing the study of anatomy and physiology, divides his subject into six parts. In the first of these he offers some general views respecting anatomy, physiology, and all the branches of physics which are employed in illustrating the nature and properties of organized and living beings. In this part he gives a copious history of the progressive improvements in anatomy and physiology, points out the relations that take place between these sciences, and the auxiliary branches of mathematics, mechanical philosophy, chemistry, and natural history; he considers the principal differences that distinguish organized from inorganic matter; the nature, effects, and duration of life, and of the general and particular powers or faculties of nature, both in living and brute matter.\n\nIn the second part he lays down the fundamental principles on which the physical constitution and particular economy of man depend; treats of man considered individually; of his formation, structure, and varieties; of the modifications produced in the nature of man by age, sex, habit, and temperament; of the relations between man and external objects; of the action and reaction of the organic systems on each other; of the organic structure of man, and of its several varieties in the different parts and organs; of the natural composition of the different fluids and solids of the human body; and gives a methodical division of the functions, with a critical examination of the modes of classification commonly received.\n\nIn the third part he treats of the phenomena of the animal economy, in the relation which they bear to the perpetual commerce established between man and the organs that surround him, or of sensation and motion. Here he considers the action of external objects upon man, whence result the phenomena of sensation, and the action of man on external objects, from which arise the phenomena of motion.\n\nIn the fourth part he treats of the phenomena of the animal economy, in the relation which they bear to the consistence of the fluids, the cohesion of its solids, and the temperature of the whole system. Here he considers the mutual action between the vessels and the blood, from which result both in the solids and fluids, that degree of cohesion and pliability that favours the necessary expansibility of the living body, or the function of circulation; the action of the air, and of caloric, on the solids and fluids, from which results the degree of expansion necessary to life, or the function of respiration.\n\nIn the fifth part he treats of the phenomena of the animal economy in the relation which they bear to the healthy and entire state of the material substance and composition of the body. Here he considers the action of alimentary substances on the human body, in repairing its loss, and preserving its substance, from which result the phenomena of digestion, absorption, and nutrition; and of the action of certain organs on the fluids of the body, in separating those which do not serve the purposes of nutrition, from which result the phenomena of secretion and excretion.\n\nIn the sixth and last part, he treats of the phenomena of the animal economy in the relation which they bear to the commerce established between the individual and the species. Here he considers the mutual physical action of the two sexes, from which arise the phenomena of generation; and the mutual moral action of several individuals, from which result the phenomena of speech, and mutual intelligence.\n\nFrom this sketch of the arrangement of Dumas it will be seen, that although he takes a very extensive view of the subject, his observations are chiefly confined to the human body.\n\nThough the lectures of Cuvier do not contain a complete system of physiology, the anatomical matter in them is, however, so much blended with observations on the animal economy, that it will be of importance for the physiological student to be acquainted with his arrangement.\n\nThe whole work is divided into 30 lectures: the first of which is occupied with preliminary observations on the animal economy, comprehending a general view of the functions of animal bodies; a general idea of the organs of which the animal body is composed; a view\nof the principal differences exhibited by these organs, and of the relations which exist among those variations, together with a division of animals founded on their organization. The second lecture treats of the organs of motion in general; the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth lectures are merely anatomical, exhibiting a comparative view of these organs in the several classes of animals.\n\nThe seventh lecture is strictly physiological, and treats of the organs of motion considered in the several actions of standing, walking, seizing and climbing, leaping, swimming, and flying.\n\nThe eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth lectures, are occupied in considering the anatomy and physiology of the function of sensation. Of these, part of the ninth treats of the nervous system in general, and of its action; part of the twelfth gives the physiology of vision; part of the thirteenth, that of hearing; part of the fourteenth, that of touch; and part of the fifteenth, that of smell and taste.\n\nThe sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first lectures treat of the organs and phenomena of digestion, mastication, inhalation, and deglutition. The twenty-second lecture treats of what have been called the afflatus chylopoietic viscera, namely, the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, and their offices. The twenty-fourth treats of the organs and phenomena of circulation in general; the twenty-fifth of those of respiration in general; the twenty-eighth of the organs of voice.\n\nThe twenty-ninth treats of the organs and phenomena of generation, and the thirtieth, of those of excretion, comprehending a general view, both of secretion and excretion.\n\nSubjoined to Bichat's introduction to his Anatomie Generale, there is a tabular view of physiology, in which, after some preliminary outline of the general structure of the organs and of the phenomena of vitality, he divides the functions into classes, orders, and genera.\n\nThe first class consists of the functions that relate to the individual; the first order of which, comprising the functions of animal life, comprehends five genera, viz. sensations, cerebral functions, locomotion, voice, and nervous transmission, besides sleep. The second order of this class contains the functions of organic life, and comprehends eight genera, viz. digestion, respiration, circulation, exhalation, absorption, secretion, nutrition, and calorification.\n\nThe second class contains the functions that relate to the species in general, and is divided into three orders. The first of these, comprising the functions peculiar to the male, comprehends only one genus, viz. the production of the seminal fluid. The second comprises the functions peculiar to the female, and contains three genera, viz. menstruation, the production of milk, and of the female generative fluids. The third order comprises the functions that relate to the union of the two sexes, and the product of that union; and it comprehends also three genera, viz. generation, gestation, and delivery.\n\nRelating the peculiar doctrines of this writer we shall speak hereafter.\n\nThere is still another mode of arranging the phenomena of living bodies, that deserves to be noticed, namely, that in which they are arranged according to the artificial systems of natural history. This mode of arrangement, though of infinite advantage to the zoologist, by shewing him at once the extent of his subject, and giving to his memory a power of recollection which it could not otherwise possess, is yet not such as the physiologist would wish to be observed. Zoological arrangements are useful chiefly as they facilitate the study of the manners, dispositions, and habits of different animals; and all that part of the outward economy which indicates something of the wisdom and design displayed by the Creator, in their structure and adaptation to the modes of life which they are intended to pursue; but they do not sufficiently illustrate the internal structure on which this outward economy depends, nor do they sufficiently explain the more secret functions, which being independent of the will of the creature, only display the power and omniscience of him who made it. This will be readily conceived from considering the difference between zoology and physiology, as we have defined it. Zoology is chiefly led to examine the animal kingdom as it usually presents itself to the eye, including a great variety of objects; physiology examines only that part of the animal economy which is principally made known by anatomy and chemistry. Zoology has been accustomed to divide its kingdom into so many classes or orders of animals; physiology would naturally divide its economy into so many functions. Zoology has usually subdivided its classes by certain obvious external marks, as the teeth and claws; physiology would naturally subdivide its functions by the varieties of those organs which are destined to perform them, as the several kinds of lungs and stomachs. Zoology mentions the functions only in a cursory manner, as forming a part of the history of animals; physiology takes notice of animals, only when they are of use to illustrate the functions. To these differences we may add another; that physiology, in the extended sense which we have given it, goes beyond zoology in comprehending the economy of the vegetable creation. From this comparison it will be admitted, that things which are primary in a zoological method, will often be secondary in a physiological arrangement, and vice versa. This is very conspicuously the case in one of the grand divisions of Linnaeus, viz. mammalia, where the important secretory organs of the milky fluid are noticed only like the colour of the hair, or the length of the tail, as a good outward mark of distinction, and likewise in the excellent table by D'Aubenton in his introductory view of natural history, in the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, in which the function of digestion is not even mentioned.\n\nIt is, however, extremely useful, both to the naturalist and physiologist, that the arrangements of both of the sciences should be, as far as possible, adapted to each other, by marking the relative importance of the several physiological functions in the various classes of living beings. This has been very ably performed by Vieq d'Azyr, a modification of whose table has been given in the comparative part of our Anatomy. See Vol. II. p. 280.\n\nWith respect to all physiological arrangements we may observe, that as the phenomena of living beings are so intimately dependent on each other, as to form the links of one continued chain, it is of little consequence which of the functions or phenomena we make the point from which we set out in our examination. But as the organs of sensation in most animals, and those of digestion in almost all living creatures, are among the first","sp":53,"ep":55},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"That are evolved, it appears most convenient to begin with one of these. The following is the arrangement that we shall adopt in the present article.\n\nAfter giving a sketch of the progress of physiological discoveries and opinions, we shall divide the remaining part of the article into 16 chapters.

In the second we shall consider the phenomena of sensation, the action of the nervous system, and the external senses of feeling, tasting, smelling, hearing, and sight. In the third and fourth chapters we shall treat of irritability, and the phenomena of motion. In the fifth we shall treat of digestion; in the sixth of absorption; in the seventh of circulation; in the eighth of respiration and voice; and in the ninth of nutrition, as completed by the successive performance of the four preceding functions. In the tenth chapter we shall treat of the phenomena of secretion; and in the eleventh, of those of excretion. In the twelfth we shall consider the various means by which living beings defend themselves from external injury, or the phenomena that attend the evolution and change of the integuments, to which function we shall give the name of integumentation. In the thirteenth chapter we shall consider the transformations that take place in some tribes of living beings, especially insects and reptiles. In the fourteenth we shall briefly examine the phenomena of reproduction, and the hypotheses to which they have given birth. In the fifteenth we shall consider the nature of sleep, and the phenomena of dreams; and in the sixteenth we shall terminate our inquiries by a few observations on the nature and phenomena of death.\n\nThe following table is intended to exhibit an outline of the principal circumstances attending the phenomena of life, in the order in which we have enumerated them.\n\n| Universal | Diffused through the body.

A speculative metaphysician, accustomed to wander over the field of abstraction, to enlarge the sphere of his intellectual notions, to transform sensible objects into ideas, this author could never persuade himself that a being could not proportion and adapt its organs to the operations they are to perform, without professing a knowledge of their operations, and having already exercised a judgment with respect to them. It is from this that he confounds the principle of life with the thinking soul, which being incessantly present in every part of the body, directs and disposes them according to its own views, and to the end that it proposes in the continual development of the actions it is to conduct.\n\nThe formation, the structure, duration, and movements of the body, do not belong peculiarly to it, as it is only a passive subject on which the foul impresses and realizes the idea of the phenomena that he has conceived. Every thing is derived from the union of the body with the active foreseeing principle, which governs, according to special laws, those phenomena which are more particularly vital, and which are most independent of the will. The immediate action of this latter faculty does not require the affluence of any other substance. The intervention of an intermediate principle would be there superfluous; and Stahl rejects that of the animal spirits, which had been introduced to explain the mechanism of vitality, and which, by overcharging the science, embarraces it with a useless hypothesis.\n\nTwo faculties are sufficient for the soul to act upon the body, and to preserve it in a living state, viz. those of sense and motion. By the former the animal learns to know the properties of the objects by which he is surrounded, or in which he is interested, and to estimate the relations that subsist between these objects and himself; the latter produces the motion of the whole machine, and determines all the changes of situation which it has to undergo in its whole, and in its parts.\n\nThe faculty of sensation has two modifications, relative to the two kinds of knowledge which the soul may receive by means of that function. The first of these resides in the organs of sense, and is adapted to external objects; the second establishes its seat in the interior organs, and refers to objects that are within, or ideas. Sometimes the moving power enveloped in the muscular system is displayed by the sensible actions that regulate the position of the body with respect to the objects of the universe, of which it makes a part; sometimes concentrated within these organs, it excites internal motions, which maintain among their constituent parts, those relations, and that equilibrium, which are necessary to preserve the healthy state, comfort, and tone of each organ. The muscular apparatus is subservient to the exercise of the senses; and the different motions which it impresses on the body, for the purpose of transporting it towards, or to a distance from, certain objects, are always determined by the convenience or inconvenience which the body, by means of the senses, experiences from those objects. The tonic motion, determined by the confused ideas of the principle of life, is displayed in the most hidden organic parts, in the most perfect repose and profound silence of the voluntary movements.\n\nThe soul gives to its organs the disposition that is favourable to the sensations it wishes to receive, by virtue of the judgement that it exerts respecting these sensations, before it has experienced them. This judgement is exerted on the relations between the objects that excite these impressions, and the actual state of the body; and it is the intuitive knowledge of these relations that determines, in all their infinitely diversified shades, the pleasure or the pain which the animal experiences from the objects that surround it.","sp":63,"ep":64},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"6. A sympathy takes place between those parts which are supplied by branches of the same nerve. Thus, a violent scratching of the head often produces sneezing; powerful odours inhaled at the nose produce a flow of tears; the head sympathizes with the stomach; the mammae with the uterus, &c.\n\nThere are all the phenomena respecting sensation which we can at present notice; we shall mention others when we come to consider the relation between this function and those of motion, digestion, circulation, &c.\n\nWhat have been called the internal senses, as memory, imagination, and judgement, are rather qualities of the mind, than operations of the brain; and the consideration of them belongs rather to metaphysics than physiology. To that article, therefore, we refer the reader; and we shall conclude this account of the phenomena of sensation with the following comparative view of that function in the inferior animals.\n\nIn all animals that have nerves, voluntary motions and direct sensations take place by the same means as in man. The differences in their motions depend partly on the intrinsic mobility of their fibres, and partly on the disposition of their muscles, and the parts to which they are attached.\n\nThe differences in their sensations depend on the number of their senses, and the perfection of the organs belonging to each sense. The animals that approach nearest to man have their senses equal in number to his. In certain species, some of their senses are even more perfect in the structure of their organs, and susceptible of more lively and delicate impressions than ours; on the contrary, in proportion as animals are removed from us, the number of their senses and the perfection of certain organs are diminished; but perhaps some animals, at the same time, possess senses of which we can form no idea.\n\nWe know not whether there are differences in the intrinsic sensibility of the nervous system of different animals, i.e., whether an equal impression made on an organ equally perfect, would affect every animal with the same force.\n\nThe animals next in order to man have, like him, spontaneous, or what we call internal, sensations. Images are excited in them at times, when they receive no immediate impression from external objects. Thus, dogs and parrots dream. We are not certain, indeed, that the more inferior animals experience similar sensations.\n\nThe passions produce effects in animals similar to those which they excite in man. Love is manifested in the same manner in all classes; fear occasions a discharge of excrements in quadrupeds and birds; it makes them tremble, and even renders insects immovable; but the other animals afford fewer examples of these kind of phenomena than man, because they are not masters of their imagination, cannot direct it towards certain objects, and create for themselves fictitious passions. We are even ignorant whether their imaginations can, like ours, be brought up to such a pitch as to make them experience emotions of anger, desire, or fear, from simple ideas or simple recollections; and whether the real presence of the objects which cause these passions, is not always necessary to excite them in the inferior animals; we know, however, that those which approach nearest to us, the mammalia and the birds, have their fellows. The affection they feel on the absence or loss of a companion, friend, or benefactor, is manifested by evident signs, in the same manner as they testify their attachment without any temporary inducement.\n\nThe same animals exhibit frequent proofs of a very perfect memory; some even appear to possess a certain degree of judgement. But does anything similar exist in the interior classes, and particularly in the lowest? Of this we shall probably remain always ignorant.\n\nWith so much resemblance in the structure of the nervous system, in its mode of action, and in the number and structure of the principal external organs, why is there so vast a difference, as to the total result, between man and the most perfect animal?\n\nIs this owing to a more accurate proportion in the relative perfection of the external organs, so that one does not so much surpass another? Or has the internal organ, in which are performed all the intermediate operations between the sensation received and the movement executed, that is to say, the organ of perception, memory and judgement, greater differences than we have yet observed? Or, finally, is the substance by which these processes are effected of a different nature? These, however, are not anatomical questions.\n\nThe sympathies or effects resulting from the connections of nerves with each other, and the influence of the nerves on vegetative functions, are subject to the same laws in man and the other animals.\n\nThe theory of sensation is perhaps more imperfect than that of any other function. On this subject we can derive little light from the structure of the brain and nerves, accurately as this has been examined. Anatomy has taught us, that the principal part of these organs consists of very delicate fibres, intermixed with a medullary pulp, and incased in membranes; and that they are furnished with a great proportion of blood-vessels; but whether the seat of sensation resides in the fibrous or medullary part, we cannot ascertain.\n\nIt was formerly the opinion, that the nervous power was propagated between the brain and the external organs, by vibrations of the nerves; but as the structure of these chords, and their connection with surrounding parts, must wholly disqualify them for such vibrations, this theory has long been abandoned.\n\nAnother hypothesis that has been very generally received is, that the nervous fibres are the conductors of fluid, a very subtle fluid, called the nervous fluid, the motions of which are the cause of sensation. This was the opinion of Dr Haller, (Feylin, chap. x.) and was frequently maintained by Dr Cullen. We shall present our readers with the following modification of it, as given by an able disciple of Cullen.\n\n\"It is probable, (says this writer), that in each nervous fibril, an elastic fluid is inherent, forming, from the moment of animation, a part of it; differing, however, according to the state of the constitution, in power, mobility, and, perhaps, in other qualities. Of this fluid the nerves are conductors, and are surrounded in their course by non-conducting membranes, while the same membrane lines every part of the brain, and is carried into the deepest cavities, guarding with particular attention the slightest aperture. In this view sanguiferous vessels are chiefly useful in nourishing this medullary substance, and they appear to be necessary also in adapting...\"","sp":79,"ep":80},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Chap. II. Of Sensation.\n\nThe nerves to their office; for, when the circulation is greatly increased, the sensibility is more acute; and when it languishes, or is destroyed, the nervous energy soon shares the same fate.\n\n\"This fluid must necessarily be an elastic one; and impressions are apparently conveyed through it by vibrations. It does not follow from hence, that the nerves vibrate like muscular cords; or that, in every flight-like motion, a portion is conveyed from the brain. The elasticity of the fluid is proved from the momentary continuance of the impression after the cause is removed; and vibration is a term employed in many branches of philosophy as a means of communicating motion, without any distinct application. If we touch an object with a flick, or with a metallic rod, we perceive through it the impression, and, in a general way, the nature of the substance. The impression must be conveyed by something; and whatever that something is, it may as well convey impressions through the nerves as through the rod. But through the nerves only can it affect the brain, and produce an idea, or some change in the brain, or its fluid connected with the nature of the object, and which conveys to the mind some peculiar and discriminated impression which it afterwards retains.\"\n\nA third hypothesis, which is at present very fashionable, is, that sensation is produced by a change in the substance of the brain and nerves. M. Cuvier is an advocate for this doctrine, which he illustrates in the following manner.\n\nThe nervous system is susceptible of two kinds of action; one which is confined to our sensitive faculty, and another which affects our vital and vegetative functions only. External sensations are produced by the impressions of external bodies, on our senses; internal sensations, by changes which take place, in the state of the internal parts of the body, to which the nerves are distributed; and spontaneous sensations are caused by a change in the nerves, or in the brain itself, without any external excitement.\n\nThese circumstances, added to the phenomena arising from the cutting or tying of nerves, show, that sensation does not reside in the external organs, but nearly in the centre of the nervous system, and that the external organs serve only to receive the action of the external bodies, and to convey it to the nerves, by which it is propagated to a greater distance. They also demonstrate, that this propagation is not produced by any matter or concussion, but by a change in the state of the nervous substance. This change may arise from internal causes, or it may be produced by external causes, different from those which usually occasion it. The nerves are not merely passive agents, nor the conductors or reservoirs of any particular matter; but it appears, that the substance which produces sensation, is liable to be consumed, or to lose its activity by exertion.\n\nThere are phenomena which show that the general susceptibility of the nerves, for receiving sensations, may vary in consequence of causes external to the nerves themselves, and which can operate only by altering their substance. Certain medicines weaken or revive that susceptibility; inflammation frequently increases it to an excessive degree. Does this take place in consequence of an increased secretion of the nervous matter? The most remarkable change that occurs in the susceptibility of nerves, is sleep. It is not unnatural to suppose that this change may be occasioned by the temporary loss of the substance which is essentially sensitive. But how does it happen that sleep depends, in a certain degree, on the will? Why do we awake suddenly, or from causes which do not appear calculated to restore that substance? Why does cold produce sleep? From these observations, may it not rather be supposed that this state is the effect of a change in the chemical nature of the nervous substance?\n\nBut whether the substance contained in the nerves is exhausted by sensations, or whether it merely undergoes an alteration in its chemical composition, and becomes, as it were, neutralized, it must remain in the nerve throughout the whole of its course, and leave it only at one of its extremities. It does not, however, resemble the blood in the vessels, either as to the manner in which it is retained, or in which it moves in the nerve. There is no evidence of the nerves being tubular. No phenomena indicate that any matter escapes from them when they are divided. Besides, what vessels could have parietes sufficiently compact to retain so subtle a fluid as that of the nerves must be. It is far more probable that it is retained in the nerves, in the same manner as the electric matter is in electric bodies, by communication and inflation; and that the nervous system is its only conductor, while all the other parts of the animal body are, with respect to it, coherent substances.\n\nThe theory of sensatorial power, brought forward by Dr Darwin, has already been noticed.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Irritability.\n\n1. When any part of a living animal body that contains muscular fibres, as a part of its composition, is touched with a sharp instrument, with a hot iron, or of irritability with a corrosive liquor; or when a shock of electricity or galvanism is made to pass through it, a contraction takes place in the part, and this contraction is discontinued when the stimulus is removed, but is renewed on repeating the application.\n\n2. The same contractions take place in certain parts of a living animal body, from an exertion of the will.\n\n3. Many parts in which the presence of muscular fibres has not been ascertained, possess the same capacity of being excited to motion by stimuli. Such are the ureters, the biliary ducts, the small blood-vessels, and probably the lymphatics; all of which, though not evidently muscular, have a fibrous structure.\n\n4. Some parts of the living animal body which appear rather nervous than muscular, possess a contractile power, as the retina.\n\n5. When the nerves which form a communication between a contractile part and the brain, in the higher orders of animals, are divided or compressed, those parts which before contracted in obedience to the will, lose this power; but,\n\n6. These parts, as well as every muscular part, still contract on the application of stimuli, particularly electricity and galvanism.\n\n7. Such parts of an animal body as have muscular fibres, are thrown into contraction on the application of stimuli, for some time after having been separated from the living body, provided that nervous filaments remain connected with the muscular fibres.\n\n8. It has been found, that the fibre of the blood is susceptible.\nsusceptible of contraction on the application of the galvanic stimulus, after having been separated from the living body.\n\n9. In some animals in which a nervous system has not been detected, as polypes, this contractile power seems to pervade every part of the animal.\n\n10. Plants, in a greater or less degree, possess the power of moving on the application of stimuli; and in some species this motion is very remarkable. See No. 57.\n\nThe above are some of the principal phenomena which take place in organized beings with respect to irritability. They are so analogous, that we may attribute them to the same cause or the same vital power. This susceptibility of being thrown into contraction on the application of stimuli is called irritability; and it is possessed in a greater or less degree by every organized being with which we are acquainted.\n\nWe have restricted the term irritability to denote the susceptibility of the fibrous structure to contraction on the application of stimuli; but it is proper to remark that this term has not always been used in the same sense.\n\nIrritability has long been employed in medicine, as applications in common language, in reference to the passions, especially that of anger; and this appears to have been the original meaning of the term.\n\nMulta fero ut placem genus irritable vatum. Hor.\n\nIt is perhaps still more common to apply it to a morbid sensibility of the system; and we speak of a person being of a very irritable habit, or possessing a great degree of irritability, when we mean to say that he possesses a more than ordinary share of sensibility, liable to a more keen sensation of the same impressions.\n\n\"Or are your nerves too irritably strung,\" Armstrong.\n\nEven the accurate Dr Whytt, to whom the proper distinction between irritability and sensibility must have been familiar, and by whom it is in general strictly regarded, sometimes falls into this inaccuracy. He speaks, in his work on nervous diseases, of \"a delicate or easily irritable nervous system.\" In fact, this confusion of irritability with sensibility, appears to be a stumbling block to most physiological writers. We shall presently inquire how far they are independent of each other.\n\nThe term irritability, in its most received acceptation, as a property of the muscular fibre, seems to have been first employed by Giffon, about the middle of the 17th century. He distinguishes two kinds of irritability, primary or direct, and secondary or sympathetic. Haller was, however, the first who treated of irritability with any degree of accuracy. He confines it to the muscular fibre; though at the same time he will not allow it to many parts, the muscularity of which has never been questioned, and which, since his time, have, by decisive experiments, been proved to possess a considerable degree of contractile power. He completely distinguishes irritability from sensibility, with which he will have it to be totally unconnected; and he attempts to make a distinction between the irritability of the living, and that of the dead fibre.\n\nDr Whytt, whose controversy with Haller respecting the nature of irritability and sensibility is famous in the annals of medical warfare, admits three kinds of irritability: 1. That power of alternate contraction and dilatation which is peculiar to those organs we call muscles; 2. That uniform contraction which takes place in the dartos (one of the coats of the scrotum) and the pores of the skin; and, 3. That redness and inflammation which is excited in every sensible part of the body, as often as acid things are applied to it; although this last is allowed by him to be only an effect of the first kind of irritability taking place in the small vessels of the part. Thus, he reduces the three kinds to two, and we may perhaps consider his second kind only as a modification of the first.\n\nAmong those who seem to have a sufficiently just idea of the nature of irritability, the word itself is not unfrequently misapplied. Thus, Vicq d'Azyr, and Dumas, in enumerating the functions of the animal body, called those of motion and sensation, irritability and sensibility. These latter are powers or capacities of living beings, and as such should be distinguished from the functions that depend on them.\n\nIn considering the phenomena of irritability, it is necessary to take notice of the several kinds of stimuli which excite it. These have been reduced by Cuvier to five orders, viz. volition; external actions operating on nerves; external actions operating on the fibre itself; mixed actions operating on both the nerves and fibres, and certain diseases or violent emotions.\n\nWhen the animal body is in a state of health, and Volition awake, the will exercises a prompt and constant influence over the greater part of the muscles, which, on that account, are denominated voluntary muscles. A small number of muscles, viz. those which produce the internal movements necessary to life, and which cannot be interrupted, such as the heart and the alimentary canal, are not subject to the will. It must be observed, however, that some of the muscles, that in man and most other animals are involuntary, are subject to the will in others. This is the case with the stomach in ruminating animals, the movements of which may be exerted at pleasure in two different directions. In some muscles, as in those of respiration, there seems to be a mixed action with respect to the will, as this faculty can interrupt their motion for a time, though, in general, this is continued from habit, without the will, or even consciousness of the animal. Those muscles that are absolutely involuntary, are continually excited by an extraneous irritating cause; for the blood which is brought to the heart on every dilatation, determines that organ to contraction, and the alimentary canal is affected in the same manner by its contents. It seems, therefore, that the will is not essential to the action of these muscles, and that it cannot interrupt their motion (c).\n\n(c) There are facts which show that the will has often considerable influence even on muscles that are universally styled involuntary. The abbe Fontana, when making experiments with wheel polypes, was led to believe that the heart, in these animalcules, is a voluntary muscle, and from this belief he learned, in some degree, to accelerate.\nA muscle laid bare, and exposed to an irritating cause, will contract itself, even in the living subject, without being influenced by the will. It should seem, therefore, that though the muscles which we call voluntary, are usually put in motion by the will, they may yet be excited to action in opposition to that faculty.\n\nThe will itself seems to act only through the medium of the nerves; and it is found that those nerves which supply the voluntary muscles, are generally the largest.\n\nThe external stimuli that act on the muscular fibre through the medium of the nerves, and on the fibre itself, are chiefly of a mechanical and chemical nature, as concussions, punctures, lacerations, all of which are capable of producing convulsive motions in all the muscular parts to which the nerves extend.\n\nOne of the most remarkable of these stimuli is the galvanic influence. It is well known that the experiments by which this influence is made to act on the muscular fibre, consist in establishing between a muscle and the trunk of the nerves which extend to it, an external communication with one, or a series of substances placed close to each other. Metals are not the only means that may be employed in this operation; and in general, the conductors are not the same as those of electricity. Experiments have sometimes been successfully performed, when an interval was left in the series of exciters: this circumstance, in the opinion of Cuvier, proves the existence of an atmosphere.\n\nThe moment the contact takes place, the muscle suffers violent convulsions. These experiments succeed on the living body, or animals recently dead, and even on parts separated from the body, precisely in the manner of those which Haller accounts for on the principle of irritability. Neither pointed instruments nor acid liquors are necessary; and the galvanic experiments even succeed when these means have failed.\n\nDiffusion has been observed to have a powerful effect in exciting irritability.\n\nViolent passions may, to a certain degree, be considered as the acts of the will strongly excited. These, in some cases, have an influence even on the involuntary muscles; for it is no unusual thing for palpitation of the heart, and sometimes even a suspension of its motion, to be the consequence of strong passions. These actions, however, are to be prevented by moderating the excess of sensibility by which they are occasioned. Even in nervous diseases, which appear to be the least connected with those passions whose influence is more immediately felt, the will is often capable of preventing or retarding the approach of nervous symptoms, when the patient is determined to resist the paroxysm.\n\nFrom what has been said, it appears that, in the superior classes of animals, all the orders of stimuli, either act through the medium of the nerves, or that they are capable of being modified or controlled by the will, the exertion of which depends on nervous influence.\n\nWith respect to the immediate cause of irritability, there have been several opinions. One of those which has been most generally received is, that irritability is intimately connected with sensibility; or, that it is an immediate effect of the nervous power. This was the opinion of Whytt and Cullen, the former of whom endeavours to prove it by the following arguments.\n\n1. We almost always observe the irritability of the Whytt's muscular organs of the human body to bear a proportion to their sensibility. Thus, children, and people of nervous delicate nerves and very quick feelings, are most subject to convulsive and spasmodic diseases, while on the other hand old people, and those of less delicate sensibility, have a muscular system that is not so irritable.\n\n2. Whatever increases the sensibility of the muscles, also increases their irritability.\n\n3. Whatever lessens or destroys the sensibility of the muscles, also lessens or destroys their irritability or power of motion.\n\n4. That the motions of irritated muscles are owing to the sensation excited by the stimulus applied to them; Dr Whytt thinks highly probable, if it be considered that we are in fact conscious of many involuntary motions in our own bodies, proceeding from a particular sensation, either in the organs moved, or in the neighbouring parts.*\n\nDr Cullen was so fully convinced of the necessity of nervous influence to produce muscular contraction, that he considered the muscular fibre to be only a continuation of the nervous fibre. See Medicine, No. 73.\n\nHaller, as we have said, strenuously maintained, that Haller's irritability was quite independent of the nerves, and was an inherent power or vis insita of the muscular fibre. Indeed there are several circumstances which would induce us to believe that irritability is at least, in some cases, independent of nervous influence. We have seen (No. 111.) that it takes place in those animals in which there is no appearance of nerves; and that it is very remarkable in some species of vegetables, in which none but the most fanciful physiologists have dreamed of finding a nervous system. Nay, it appears that the fibrine of the blood, which we can scarcely suppose to be affected by the nervous power, when taken out of the body, is still susceptible of irritation.\n\nFrom a comparison of all these circumstances, we General must either conclude, that the irritability of living muscles, and of the superior animals, is different from that of the fibrine, of polypes and plants; or, if we admit that nervous influence is essential to irritability, we must allow that this influence extends to the latter class of organized bodies.\n\nBefore we quit the subject of irritability, we must notice the chemical hypotheses that have been lately proposed, to explain the immediate cause of this faculty.\n\nThe first of these is that of Girtanner, who considered oxygen as the principle of irritability. The Girtanner's arguments opinions.\n\n* Physiologicaal Effects of Nervous Influence on Muscular Contraction.\n\n\u2020 Ita.\narguments on which he founded this opinion are the following:\n\n1. The irritability of organized bodies is always in a direct ratio to the quantity of oxygen they contain.\n2. Every thing that augments the quantity of oxygen in organized bodies augments at the same time their irritability.\n3. Every thing that diminishes the quantity of oxygen diminishes likewise their irritability.\n\nHe distinguishes the organized fibre by three different states:\n1. A state of health, or the tone of the fibre, in which the oxygen exists in its proper quantity.\n2. A state of accumulation, in which the fibre is overcharged with the oxygen or irritable principle.\n3. A state of exhaustion, in which the fibre is more or less deprived of it.\n\nHe likewise arranges the substances, that are capable of coming into contact with the irritable fibre, into three classes.\n\nThe first comprehends those substances that have the same degree of affinity for the irritable principle or oxygen, as the organized fibre itself; hence the substances produce no effect upon it.\n\nThe second comprehends those substances that have a less degree of affinity for oxygen than the organized fibre has: hence these, when they come into contact with it, surcharge it with oxygen, and produce a state of accumulation. They are called negative stimuli.\n\nThe third comprehends substances for which oxygen has a greater affinity than it has for the organized fibre. These, therefore, deprive the fibre of its oxygen, and produce a state of exhaustion. They are called positive stimuli.\n\nBy way of answer to this fanciful doctrine, we may observe, that if oxygen were so essential to irritability as is supposed in Girtnaner's positions, those animals which require most oxygen should possess most irritability, and those which are capable of living for a long time in deoxygenated air, should have their irritability very low. Now, the reverse of this is found to take place. The muscular fibres of birds which respire more oxygen than most other animals, possess but little irritability, while reptiles and worms, which can live for a long time without oxygen, are universally and strongly irritable.\n\nThe other opinion is that of Humboldt, who considers the galvanic fluid as the source of nervous power, and the primary cause of irritability. He lays down three principles as necessary to excite irritability; viz:\n1. Oxygen, which forms combinations with different acidifiable bases.\n2. The acidifiable bases (carbon, hydrogen, azote, and phosphorus) of the fibre, with which the oxygen may combine.\n3. The galvanic fluid.\n\nThe galvanic fluid produces, according to Humboldt, the same effect in the animal economy, as the electric fluid in the mixture of azote and oxygen. It is this galvanic fluid that, being conveyed by the nerves, brings about the combinations of the oxygen with the different acidifiable bases of the fibres; but when the nerve of a part is tied, it prevents the fluid from passing, which explains the reason of the irritability being destroyed.\n\nThe oxygen necessary for these unions is carried by the arterial blood in the course of circulation; and the acidifiable bases, which are to unite with it, are found to be already present in the fibre.\n\nHe found that every thing that augments too much the quantity of the acidifiable bases diminishes the irritability; and that every thing that increases too much the quantity of oxygen, likewise diminishes it; and he thinks it very probable, that the same takes place with respect to the proportion of the galvanic fluid.\n\nIt is therefore only in a just equilibrium of these principles that the necessary irritability of the parts consists.\n\nUpon these principles this philosopher thus explains the production of muscular motion. \"In a state of repose, the nerve being inserted in the muscles, the galvanic fluid is put into equilibrium in organs that touch each other. The spontaneous motion is made by a surcharge of galvanic fluid into the nerve. It appears that the instant we wish to make a motion, the galvanic fluid produced in the brain, is carried en masse towards the part that ought to move, and surcharges the nervous fibres. A discharge from the nerve is then made into the muscles. The particles of these last, animated by increased affinities, approach each other, and it is this that constitutes the phenomena of muscular motion.\"\n\nDumas lays down the following fundamental laws reflecting animal irritability.\n\n1. The essential characteristic of irritability consists in a series of contractions and dilatations, determined either by the impression of an external stimulus, or by the simple exertion of the will.\n\n2. Irritability is independent of the action of the nerves; and though generally diffused throughout the animal organization, it belongs rather to the muscular fibre than to any other structure. Its action is in proportion to the number of fibres upon which the irritating causes can exert their influence.\n\n3. Irritability is a relative faculty which is not indiscriminately obedient to every species of excitation, but only to those which have some relation to it in the different parts of the living body.\n\n4. There belongs to each organ a specific irritability which requires a peculiar stimulus, accommodated to its nature, and to the kind of functions which it exercises.\n\n5. Irritability has certain vicissitudes of diminution and increase, which vary in the different species of animals, in the different organs of the same animals, and under the different circumstances that successively occur in the life of an individual.\n\n6. Irritability is developed with most energy at the moment of death, and immediately after this has taken place.\n\n7. It is multiplied and revived in proportion as the organ which has lost it is divided into a greater number of pieces.\n\n8. It diffuses itself in each part with a velocity proportioned to the activity, number, and duration, of the irritations by which it is excited.\n\n9. There exist mutual relations with respect to influence between sensibility and irritability, though each of them is essentially distinct from the other.\n\n10. The exercise of this faculty supposes in the organs a moderate degree of cohesion, above or below which the action of this force is enfeebled, obstructed, or opposed.\"\nThe organs of motion vary considerably in their nature and connection in the different classes of animals. In some tribes, as in the animalcules and polypes, no distinct organs can be observed. In all above these, however, there are evident muscular fibres, and in many there are hard parts or strong membranes, which serve as points of attachment and fulcrum of motion to these fibres. The muscular fibres are to be considered as the essential moving organs, while the parts to which they are attached are merely the passive functions of this organ. It would be out of place here to enter on a comparative account of the organs of motion; and there is the less occasion for it, as they have been more or less fully described in the former part of the work. The bones, ligaments, muscles, and tendons, with their appendages, as they appear in man, have been amply described in the first and second chapters of the First Part of Anatomy; and those of other animals have been briefly noticed in the Second Part of that article. Such of our readers as wish for a more particular account, may consult Cuvier's Lectures vol. i. or Blumenbach's Comparative Anatomy, chap. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 22.\n\nMany of the phenomena of muscular motion, as they take place in man, have also been related under Anatomy, No. 85 and 86. We shall therefore only enumerate and briefly illustrate these phenomena, and shall then proceed to consider a most interesting part of the physiology of motion, the progression of different animals.\n\nDr Barclay, in his late excellent work on the muscular motions of the human body, has considered the general subject of muscular action under the following heads, which may be considered as fundamental principles.\n\n1. Flethy fibres that are continued into tendon by a straight line, shorten the muscle which they compose, in the same degree in which they shorten themselves; those fibres which enter the tendon obliquely, shorten it more, and still more in proportion to their degree of contraction, as they deviate more from the line of the tendon, and approach nearer to the perpendicular, in which last direction they would shorten the muscle most with the least contraction.\n\nThis may be illustrated in the following manner. Let AB (fig. 1) represent a tendon, and CD a flethy fibre; and let us suppose that AB is the diameter, and CD the radius of the same circle ADB. It is evident that if the fibre CD should contract so as to bring the point C of the tendon to the point G in the straight line, the extremities of the tendon A, B, (which are supposed to be moveable) would come respectively to E and F; and the situation of the tendon itself would be represented by the angle EGF. If the fibre could be supposed to contract so as to bring the point C to D, the two parts of the tendon CA and CB, would come in contact. If, on the other hand the fibre CH, which enters the tendon obliquely, were to contract to H, so as to bring the point C to H, the point A would be drawn but a little beyond the middle point C, so that although this latter fibre is contracted to as great an extent as the former, it has not brought the extremities of the tendon so near together.\n\n2. When two fibres enter a tendon on opposite sides and contract at the same time, they will draw the tendon in the diagonal, and the more nearly the angles which they form with the tendon approach to right angles, the more will the length of the muscle be shortened in proportion to the degree of contraction of the fibres.\n\nLet the fibres BC, BD, BE, BF, BG, (fig. 2.) be flethy fibres, inserted into the tendon AB, at the point B, and let us suppose that all these fibres co-operate in bringing the point B to the point G, in the straight line BG. Now the straight fibre BG will be so much shortened when B comes to G, as to be obliterated, while the oblique fibres EB and FB will be shortened only to Ea and Fb, and the more oblique fibres CB and DB will remain of the length of Cc and Dd.\n\n3. All muscles that are inserted into bones, are thereby furnished with levers, and as in the action of all levers there are also a fulcrum, a power, and a resistance, these in different cases will be differently situated with respect to one another.\n\na. In the motions of the head backward and forward on the atlas, the fulcrum is situated between the power and the resistance; or the lever is of what is called in mechanics, the first kind. See Mechanics, No. 33.\n\nb. When the tibia rests upon the astragalus, and the heel is raised by the muscles of the calf of the leg acting on the tendon achillis, the resistance (which in this case is the prelude of the tibia) is situated between the power and the fulcrum, which are here respectively at the heel and at the toes; or the lever is of the second kind.\n\nc. In raising a weight at the palm of the hand, and bending the arm at the joint of the elbow, the power of action in this joint is situated between the resistance and the fulcrum, which are here respectively at the palm of the hand and the distal extremity of the humerus (D), or the lever is of the third kind.\n\nThe shortness of the lever, and consequently the great force of the muscular power required to overcome the resistance in this last case, may be thus illustrated. Let AB (fig. 3.) represent the radius articulated at B with the humerus BC; let DFE represent the biceps flexor muscle hanging along the humerus, and attached to the radius at E; and suppose a weight W hung to the distal extremity A of the radius. Now, BH will represent the lever of resistance, and BG perpendicular to it the lever of the muscle, which is in this case extremely short.\n\n4. As, other things being equal, all muscles produce a greater extent of motion by a less proportional degree of contraction, and consequently a less proportional change in their fibres, than if they were shorter; those muscles which follow a direct course are seldom attached at the nearest points of the two bones with which\n\n(d) In Dr Barclay's nomenclature, that extremity of a bone which is towards the trunk is called proximal, and that extremity which looks from the trunk is called distal.\nOf Animal which they are connected. Hence, beside the advantages already mentioned, relations are thus formed between parts at a distance, and the mutual dependence of the functions and their organs is extended and strengthened. On the contrary, those muscles that are not extended along the surface of the bones to which they are attached, are observed to follow an oblique direction, by which they acquire not only contractibility and length, but at the same time a shorter lever than if they had been inserted at the same place with a less obliquity.\n\n5. Of muscles attached to ribs that are parallel, equally moveable, and at right angles to the vertebral column, those that follow a direct course from one to the other, will act on each by equal levers, and make them approach with the same velocity; while those that observe an oblique course will act on each by different levers, and make them approach with different velocities.\n\nLet AB and CD (fig. 4.) represent two parallel ribs, articulated with the vertebral column at A and C, where they are equally moveable; and let DB and DE be two muscles, the former observing a direct, and the latter an oblique course. The levers of DB will be AB and CD, which, as AC is parallel to BD, are evidently equal; but the levers of DE will be CF and AG, which being of different lengths, the muscle must act with different degrees of force on the different ribs, so that it will make CD, on which it acts with the longest lever, approach AB, faster than it will make this latter approach the former.\n\nCorollary.\u2014When bones are not parallel, the muscles that cross in the interval between them, must fall obliquely on both, as it is impossible for a straight line to be at the same time perpendicular to two other lines, unless these be parallel.\n\n6. As all bones move on a centre or axis of motion, while the muscular attachments move in a circumference, the muscles, in changing the relative position of any two bones, must at the same time, be changing the direction of their own action, and varying their lever.\n\nLet AB and CD (fig. 5.) represent parts of two parallel ribs, and let AB be moveable on the centre A, and let CF and GE be two muscles inserted obliquely into AB at F and E. Now suppose that by the action of these muscles, AB is brought into the position Ab. The points of attachment of the two muscles to AB, will now be f and e, and the muscles will be Cf and Ge, having changed their length, situation, obliquity, and lever.\n\n7. All muscles where the points of attachment move in a circle, draw either towards the centre, or towards the circumference.\n\n8. If any two bones could, by the action of their muscles, be made to approach in a parallel direction, the oblique muscles attached to their parallel, and approaching surfaces, would perform a greater extent of motion with a less shortening of their fibres, than any straight muscles attached to the same parallel surfaces.\n\nLet AB and CD (fig. 6. and 7.) be parts of two ribs that are parallel, and that will continue parallel till they are brought in contact by the action of the straight muscles AC, EF, and BD, or by the action of the oblique muscles CE and DE (fig. 7.) and FA and FB (fig. 6.). It is evident, that when the point E comes in contact with F, the length of the straight muscles must be obliterated, while that of the oblique muscles will only be shortened by cE and dE in fig. 7. and fA and gB in fig. 6.\n\n9. As, however, no two bones can approach one another in a parallel direction, at least by the action of a single muscle, and as no muscle can continue to act in a direction perpendicular to their two approximating surfaces; a muscle entering them at right angles, when they are parallel, may be placed so near to the centre of motion as to carry the bones through a given space, with a less shortening of fibres than any oblique muscle that has the same origin, but is inserted at a distance, and acts through the medium of a longer lever. Further, a muscle with a less obliquity may be situated as to carry the bones through a given space, with a less shortening of fibres than any other muscle of the same origin, but of a much greater obliquity.\n\nLet AB and CD (fig. 8.) be two ribs, of which AB is moveable about the centre A; and suppose that by the shortening of the straight muscle EF, and of the two oblique muscles, EG and EH, AB is brought into the position Ab. The points of attachment, after moving in the segments Ef, Gg, and Hh, will now be respectively at f, g, and h. Now, on the centre E, with the radii Ef, Eg, and Eh, describe three different circular segments. The difference between the present and former lengths of the most oblique muscle EH, will be eH, while the differences between the present and former lengths of the muscles EG and EF, will be only eG and eF respectively.\n\n10. The shortenings which any muscle suffers in carrying round the point of its attachment through a given space, will partly depend on the length of its lever, partly upon its degree of obliquity, partly on its drawing peripheral or central, and partly on its acting without or with a pulley (E).\n\n11. The lever of a muscle, which is varied with every degree of obliquity, is also varied by every change in the centre of motion. Where bones are connected by large surfaces, the centre of motion frequently shifts from one part to another; but in general it approaches towards that aspect whither the bone is moving at the time; and as it advances, the muscles recede, to increase their force.\n\na. The lever of resistance, as well as of the power, is varied by the several changes of position; is sometimes shortened at the time that the lever of the power is lengthened; and vice versa.\n\n(e) The terms peripheral and central, are employed by Dr Barclay, to denote the aspects of any organ, according as they respect the circumference or the centre of the organ; and when the termination of these words is changed from l into d, they denote, like the other terms of his nomenclature, the direction in which the action of these parts is exerted. See Barclay's Anatomical Nomenclature.\nIf A.B (fig. 9.) represent the radius, B.C the humerus, D.E the biceps flexor muscle, and R the resistance hung to the distal extremity of the radius, it will be evident that, when B.A is, by the action of the flexor muscle, brought into the position B.a, the lever of resistance will no longer be B.A, but B.H, equal to a perpendicular straight line drawn from B, the centre of motion, to the plane of resistance; and, as the lever of resistance has been shortened, the lever of the muscle has been proportionally lengthened. Were the radius to resume its former position, the reverse of these circumstances would take place.\n\nb. Sometimes again, the lever of the power and of the resistance are lengthened or shortened at the same time.\n\nLet A.B (fig. 10.) represent the fibula, B.C the femur, and D.E.F the cruris muscle; and that the femur, with the weight of the body, is to be raised to the situation B.e; the centre of motion will, during extension, approach towards the muscle at the rotular aspect, while the plane of resistance, as is evident from the figure, will be approaching to the centre of motion.\n\nc. In the changes of attitude, while a bone is turning on its centre of motion, the centre itself is often at the same time describing either the segment of a circle, or a line composed of circular segments.\n\nLet A.B (fig. 11.) represent the foot, B.C the tibia, C.D the thigh bone, and D.E the trunk; and let us suppose that it is required to bring the three last, by the action of their muscles, to the perpendicular B.F, so that B.C shall occupy the situation of B.G, C.D the situation of G.I, and D.E the situation of I.F; the point C on the centre B will move in the segment C.G, and as C is changing its position in C.G, the point D, which moves round the point C as its centre, will, if the extensions be regularly performed in the same time, describe such a curve as D.I; for as the point D must necessarily move alternately and alternately round the point C as it passes along the segment C.G.\n\nIn like manner, if the extensions of C.D and D.E be regularly performed in the same time, the point E will describe such a curve as E.F, the points in E.F being in the circumferences of the several circles successively described round the point D as it moves along the curve D.I.\n\n12. When we examine the structure of the animal system, we shall generally find that the motions of the bones, as produced by the muscles, are the combined effects of different forces, and hence that a small number of muscles is enabled to produce, with steadiness and accuracy, an almost infinite variety of changes.\n\nFor more on the general subject of muscular action, and for an account of the principal motions of the human body, we must refer to Dr Barclay's publication.\n\nOne of the most interesting enquiries respecting animal motion, is that of the progression of different animals, or of the powers of locomotion.\n\nThose animals which possess the faculty of changing their place, exercise this faculty by very different organs. Some can only creep, as worms, and many mollusca; others can only swim, as all fishes, many of the mollusca, and some of the testacea. Most birds can both fly, walk, and run, while a few do not possess the power of exercising the first of these motions. All the mammalia, and most reptiles, properly so called, can walk, run, climb, leap, and perform a variety of other motions; and a few of the former class can imitate the flying of birds. We shall briefly examine the mechanism of these different actions, but by way of introduction, we shall first consider how the action of standing is performed.\n\nStanding, in most animals, is solely the effect of the continued action of the extensor muscles of all the joints, as is evident from the circumstance, that if an animal, while standing, suddenly dies, or in consequence of some powerful cause, as a strong electric shock, ceases to make the necessary efforts for preserving the upright position, all the articulations of the legs yield to the weight of the body, and bend under it. In some animals, however, the extention of the muscles is so much assisted by powerful ligaments attached to the articulations of the legs, that they are enabled to continue standing for a much longer time, and with much less fatigue than most others. This is the case with birds that perch, and it is particularly remarkable in the stork, which by means of this peculiar mechanism is able to stand on one foot for several days together.\n\nThe action of standing is somewhat different, according as the animal stands on two feet or on four.\n\nThat a body may be supported in a vertical position, standing on it is necessary that it be so disposed as to be in a state of two feet equilibrium, or that it be so balanced that a perpendicular line from the centre of gravity shall fall within its base. See Mechanics, No. 193, et seq. It is evident that the more extensive the base on which the body stands, the less is the danger of its losing its balance. Man can very easily preserve himself in the vertical position, from the broad basis formed by his feet, and from the great power he possesses of separating these to a considerable distance. This latter depends chiefly on the greater weight of his pelvis, and the length and obliquity of the neck of the thigh bone, by which this bone is carried more outward, and removed farther in its articulation, than in any other animal. In man, too, the foot is peculiarly adapted to stand firmly on the ground, from the flatness of its inferior surface, and from having the heel bone so formed as to come in perfect contact with the ground. The muscles that move the foot are also very advantageously inserted, and the extensor muscles of the heel are proportionally thicker than in most of the mammalia.\n\nThe thigh of man, when in the erect posture, is in a straight line with the trunk and the leg, whereas in quadrupeds, it is situated close upon the flank, and forms an acute angle with the spine. On this account, the thigh bone of quadrupeds is flat, and proportionally weaker than that of man. The extensor muscles of the thigh are proportionally stronger in man than in the other animals; and as the thigh bone moves upon the pelvis in every direction, these extensors are in man so considerable, that he is the only animal that possesses what are properly called hips.\n\nIn consequence of this structure, the human sacral extremities are furnished with a sufficient base, and form\nOf Animal very solid bodies for supporting the trunk. Man also possesses several advantages for maintaining the general equilibrium of the body, especially the facility with which he holds his head in the erect posture, owing to the position of the occipital bone, and the horizontal direction of the eyes and mouth. See the article MAN, No 5 and 6.\n\nThe quadrupeds that sometimes try to stand on their hind feet only, in order that they may either employ their fore feet in taking hold of some object, or avoid keeping their head too low, seem rather to fit than to stand. Their trunk rests at the same time on their hind feet, as far as the heel, and on the buttocks; it is still necessary, however, that their head and neck should be proportionally small, as in monkeys, squirrels, opossums, etc., otherwise the weight of those parts would be too great for the force employed in their elevation; but even when seated, the animal is generally obliged to rest on the fore feet, as may be observed in dogs, cats, etc.\n\nSome quadrupeds use their tail as a third foot, to enlarge the base of the body: and when it is strong, it is capable of contributing to their support for some time. We find examples of this in the kangaroos and jerboas.\n\nWe have already noticed the mechanism in the feet of birds, which enables these animals to support themselves on two legs, though they do not stand in a vertical position, and though the atlantal part of their bodies is advanced more beyond the centre of gravity than the sacral part. Other advantages possessed by birds in this respect are, the great flexion of the thigh bone and tarsus; the length of the anterior toes, and the length and flexibility of the neck.\n\nAn animal which stands on four feet is supported on a very considerable base; but from the great weight of the head and neck in these animals, their centre of gravity is nearer to the atlantal than to the sacral extremities (f). It is evident from this, that in quadrupeds, the former must sustain almost the whole weight of the body; and we find, accordingly, that they are furnished with very strong muscles. In short, all that the sacral extremities seem to want in muscular force, appears to be transferred to the atlantal.\n\nAs in most quadrupeds the head inclines towards the horizon, and the neck is often very long, very powerful means are required to sustain the former. These means are furnished by the great size and extensive attachments of the muscles of the neck, and especially in many quadrupeds by the cervical ligament. In the mole, which employs its head to raise considerable burdens of earth, the cervical muscles are peculiarly strong, and the ligament is converted into bone.\n\nThe body of a quadruped hangs between the four legs, and by its weight tends to draw the spine downwards. This is counteracted by the abdominal muscles, especially by the straight muscles, which produce a curvature in the opposite direction. The abdominal muscles act with peculiar force in arching the spine upwards in those mammalia that are covered with scales or spines, and are accustomed to roll themselves upon the approach of danger, as the hedgehog, the armadillos, and of Animal Motion.\n\nGiraffes quadrupeds or reptiles, have their thighs directed outward, and the inflections of the limbs take place in planes that are perpendicular to the spine. In these, therefore, the weight of the body must act with a much longer lever, in opposing the extension of the knee-joints; and accordingly they have the knees always bent, and the belly dragging on the ground between their legs, whence their name of reptiles.\n\nIn walking on a fixed surface, the centre of gravity Walking is alternately moved by one part of the extremities, and sustained by the other, the body never being at any time completely suspended over the ground.\n\nAnimals which can stand erect on two legs, such as man and birds, walk also on two legs. But several quadrupeds that cannot stand on two feet but with great difficulty, may yet move in that posture for some time with sufficient ease. This arises from its being in general less painful to walk than to stand, the same muscles not being continued so long in action. And also it is less difficult to correct the unsteady motions by contrary and alternate oscillations (a thing easy in walking), than it is to prevent them altogether.\n\nWhen man intends to walk on even ground, he first advances one foot; his body then rests equally on both legs, the advanced leg making an obtuse angle with the tarsus, and the other an acute one. The ground not yielding to the point of the foot, the heel and the rest of the leg must of necessity be raised, otherwise the heel could not be extended. The pelvis and trunk are consequently thrown upward, forward, and somewhat in a lateral direction. In this manner they move round the fixed foot as a centre, with a radius consisting of a leg belonging to that foot, which, during this operation, continually diminishes the angle formed with the tarsus. The leg which communicated this impulse is then thrown forward, and rests its foot upon the ground; while the other which now forms an acute angle with its foot, has the heel extended in its turn, and in like manner makes the pelvis and trunk turn round upon the former leg.\n\nAs each leg supports the body in its turn, as in standing on one foot, the extensor muscles of the thigh and knee are brought into action, to prevent these articulations from yielding; and the flexors act immediately after, when the leg having thrown the weight of the body on its fellow must be raised before it can again be carried forward. As the undulatory motion that necessarily attends a man's walking, cannot be perfectly regulated on both sides, he cannot walk in a perfect straight line, nor can he walk in a direct course with his eyes shut.\n\nIn walking down an inclined plane, or descending a staircase, as the advanced leg is placed lower than that which remains behind, the extensors of the leg must act more powerfully to prevent the body from falling backwards. Again, on ascending such situations it is requisite at each step, not only to transport the body horizontally,\n\n(f) These terms signify the same as superior and inferior in man, anterior and posterior in quadrupeds; but are more convenient, as applying indiscriminately to both. Atlantal denotes what is next the atlas; sacral what is next the sacrum. See Barclay's Nomenclature.\nOf Animal Motions\n\nMotion\n\nRunning is only a succession of short leaps, and it will be understood from what we shall presently say of leaping.\n\nWalking on four feet.\n\nWhen a quadruped walks, he first slightly bends the articulations of the hind legs, and then extends them, in order to carry forward the body, which motion is considerably aided by the extensors of the knee and the heel. The break being thus thrown forward, the fore legs incline backward, and the animal would fall, did it not instantly throw them forward in order to support itself. It then draws up the trunk upon the fore legs, and renews its former efforts.\n\nIn this walking, each step is performed by two legs, one belonging to the fore, and the other to the hind pair. Sometimes these are of the same side, and sometimes those of opposite sides. The motion of a horse who steps forward in the latter way, is termed a pace.\n\nIn the animals that have the fore feet longer than the hind; and have their strength chiefly in the anterior part of the body, the principal impulse is given by extending the fore foot. The hind foot then rises to follow it, and it is not until the moment that the latter extends itself in its turn, that the fore foot is raised. This is the manner in which the giraffe is said to move.\n\nBut when the fore legs are considerably disproportioned to the others, and particularly when the posterior extremities are feebly and badly articulated, as in the sloths, the animal is obliged to drag itself forward, by first extending the fore legs, and then bending them so as to draw the body after them. Hence the progression of the sloth is so laborious.\n\nThose animals which have their fore legs very short in proportion to their hind legs, would be incapable of sufficiently supporting their bodies, and must fall forward on each impulse of the latter, had they not the precaution to make a prancing movement; that is, to raise the anterior extremities entirely off the ground, previously to their being impelled onward by means of the hind feet. Accordingly, such animals cannot in propriety of language be said to walk; they only move forward by leaps. This is the case with hares, rats, and particularly jerboas. Indeed, these animals cannot be said to walk at all, except in the action of ascending. When they attempt to walk slowly on level ground, they are obliged to move themselves by the fore feet, and merely to drag after them the hind pair. This may be observed in rabbits, and still more distinctly in frogs.\n\nIn leaping, the body rises completely from the earth, and remains without any support for a short period, the duration of which depends on the force with which the leap has been made. This action is performed by a sudden extension of all the muscles belonging to the facial articulations, immediately after they have undergone an unusual degree of flexion. By this general extension the articulations receive a violent motion, the impulse of which is communicated to the center of gravity of the body, and it is thus projected with a determined velocity, which is more or less in opposition to its weight.\n\nThe projectile force and extent of the leap depend on the proportional length of the bones, and strength of the muscles. Those animals, therefore, leap best that have the facial extremities longer and thicker than the atlantal; as the kangaroos, jerboas, frogs, alligators, grylls, fleas, &c.\n\nSmall animals leap proportionally much farther than the larger species; and we know of none whose muscular strength, in this way, can be put in competition with that of a flea, which on a moderate computation is known to leap to a distance of at least 250 times its own length.\n\nThe direction of a leap depends on the situation of the centre of gravity with respect to the member by which the impulse is given. Hence, only man and birds can leap vertically, because they alone have the trunk situated above the members by which the leap is effected. Quadrupeds, and most insects, can only leap forward; but spiders, which have several long feet on each side of their body, can also leap sideways.\n\nRunning consists of a series of low leaps performed alternately by each leg. It differs from walking, in the body being projected forward at each step, and in the hind foot being raised before the anterior touches the ground. It is more rapid than the quickest walk, because the acquired velocity is preserved, and increased at each bound by a new velocity. Running, therefore, cannot be instantaneously suspended, though a stop may be put to walking at each step.\n\nIn running, the animal inclines its body forward, that the centre of gravity may be in a proper position for receiving an impulse in that direction from the hind leg; and it is obliged to move the fore leg rapidly forward, to guard against falling.\n\nMan varies his manner of running, only by taking longer or shorter steps, or giving to this motion a greater or lesser degree of rapidity; but quadrupeds vary this motion by the different order in which they raise each foot, or bring it to the ground.\n\nTrotting is a mode of running in which the feet diagonally opposite rise at once, and fall at once, each pair alternately, but in such a manner, that for a moment all the four feet are off the ground. This produces a regular motion, and the sound of the animal\u2019s steps are heard two and two in succession.\n\nGalloping is a running motion in which the animal raises the anterior feet at each step, and throws the body forward by the extension of the posterior feet. When the two fore-feet descend at the same time, and are followed by the two hind feet also descending together, the motion is called a full gallop, which is the most rapid a horse can perform, and the only mode of running in dogs, hares, &c. In this kind of gallop the steps of the horse are likewise heard by two beats at a time. The common gallop is when the two fore-feet are lifted unequally, and fall one after another. This may be divided into gallops in which the horse\u2019s footsteps are heard by a series of three or four beats, because the posterior feet may fall to the ground either both together, or one after the other.","sp":80,"ep":89},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Chap. IV.\n\ndulations, which they unbend all at once, according as they wish to give more or less velocity to their motion; some may be assisted by the scales of their belly, which they can elevate and depress, but only a few genera are capable of employing this means.\n\nSome fishes also leap to the tops of cataracts by bending their bodies strongly, and afterwards unbending them with an elastic spring.\n\nThe long-tailed cray-fishes, particularly the shrimps, leap by extending the tail after it has been previously bent under the body.\n\nThe larva of the fly, vulgarly called the maggot, forms itself into a circle, contracts itself as much as possible, then suddenly unbending, darts forward to a considerable distance.\n\nThe motion of climbing, so useful to many of the inferior animals, consists in hanging from, and strongly grasping any object susceptible of being seized by the fingers, toes, or tail, and thus rising, by successive efforts, in a direction opposite to the animal's weight. From this explanation it is evident that those animals which have the divisions of their extremities most distinct and flexible, will be the best climbers; and accordingly we find that the animals called quadrumanous, as the apes, lemurs, and a few others, perform this action in the most perfect manner. Man is but an indifferent climber, as he can only grasp with his hands. In oppofiums, ant-eaters, and sloths, one of the toes is distinct, like the thumb in man, apes, and lemurs; or else they have a considerable protuberance on the heel, which has the same effect. Many animals, as some of the monkeys, some species of oppofium and ant-eater, the manir, &c., have a very flexible prehensile tail, which assists them in climbing. The animals of the cat genus have very sharp talons, by which they are materially assisted in this kind of progression, as they enable them to adhere firmly to the bark of trees, &c. Creepers, nut-hatches, woodpeckers, and other climbing birds, support themselves in a similar manner.\n\nThe motion of flying, by which an animal can support itself for some considerable time in the air, can properly be said to be performed only by birds; for though bats can imitate this motion with tolerable success, and the galopithicus, flying-squirrels, and flying-oppofiums, appear to fly from one tree to another, the motion of the former cannot be supported for so long a time as that of birds; and the motion of the latter animals can be considered only as a leap, assisted and prolonged by the opposition given to the air, by the membranous expansion between their limbs.\n\nWhen a bird designs to fly, it first darts into the air, either by leaping from the ground, or by throwing itself from some height. In the mean time it raises the whole of the wings which had till then remained folded, and which it unfolds in a horizontal direction by extending the bones. When the wings have thus acquired all the sinuosity extent of which they are susceptible, they are suddenly depressed, till they form, with the vertical plane of the body, an angle that is obtuse upward, and acute downward. The resistance which the air gives to this motion suddenly performed in it, produces a reaction on the body of the bird, and thus moves it forward as in ordinary leaps. This impulse once given, the bird refolds the wings by bending the joints, and repeats its efforts by another stroke. As the velocity of Animal Motion thus acquired in ascending is gradually diminished by the effect of gravitation, a moment occurs in which it ceases, and in which the bird tends neither to ascend nor descend. If at this moment it gives a new stroke with the wings, it acquires a new ascending velocity, by which it will be carried as far as before, and by repeating these efforts, it will ascend in a uniform manner. If this second stroke be made before the velocity first acquired is lost, an additional impulse will be received; and by a continuance of this action the bird will ascend with an accelerated motion. If the wings do not vibrate when the ascending velocity is lost, the bird will begin to descend; and if it allow itself to fall down to the point from which it let out, it cannot ascend as high as at first, but by a much stronger exertion of the wings; but if it seizes in the fall a point situated that the acquired descending velocity, and the small space which it has to fall down reciprocally balance each other, it may, by a series of equal vibrations, keep itself at the same height.\n\nWhen a bird wishes to descend rapidly, as when it darts upon its prey, it altogether suppresses the vibration of its wings, and thus falls by its own gravity. While descending, however, it may suddenly break its fall by extending its wings, and this suspension is called a recover.\n\nWe have as yet considered only the vertical flight of a bird. To fly horizontally, it must rise in an oblique direction, and make a new movement of its wings, when it is ready to descend below the point from which it departed; but in this way it will not fly in a straight line, but will describe a series of curves so very much depressed, that the horizontal will overcome the vertical motion. In order to ascend obliquely, the bird must make quicker vibrations of its wings, and to descend in a similar direction, the vibrations must be slower.\n\nThe deviations of flight to the right or left are chiefly produced by the unequal vibrations of the opposite wing; those of the left wing carrying the bird to the right, and vice versa. The more rapid the flight is forward, the greater is the difficulty of one wing surpassing the other in the velocity of its vibrations, and of course the deviation sideways is the more difficult. Hence birds which fly with the greatest velocity make large circles in turning.\n\nThe tail, when spread out, contributes to sustain the posterior part of the body. If it is depressed when the bird has acquired a progressive velocity, it presents an obstacle which elevates the posterior part of the body, and depresses the anterior. If it is turned up, the contrary effect is produced. Some birds incline to one side, to assist them like a rudder, when they wish to change their horizontal direction.\n\nThe structure of most birds peculiarly adapts them for rapid motion through the air, and for sustaining themselves in this element with the greatest facility.\n\nSee Ornithology, No. 37.\n\nThe action of swimming, like that of flying, nearly resembles leaping, except that, like flying, the leap does not take place on a fixed surface. A great variety of animals, besides fish, and most of the other inhabitants of the waters, are capable of swimming. This action is performed with considerable ease by several of the mammalia,\nChap. IV. PHYSIOLOGY.\n\nOf Animal motion; even by the bulky elephant, and the unwieldly hippopotamus; by many tribes of birds; by several reptiles and serpents, and by some insects.\n\nThe organs employed by fishes, in making their way through the water, are their fins, tail, and air-bladder; the two former exerting the necessary motions like the wings of birds, while the latter, by being compressed or expanded, causes the necessary changes in the specific gravity of the body, and thereby renders the animal more or less buoyant. The swimming of fishes has been treated of with sufficient minuteness under Ichthyology, chap. iii. sect. 3, to which we refer the reader.","sp":89,"ep":91},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Chap. VII. Of Circulation.\n\nWe have traced the nutritious particles of the food from the intestines through the lacteals, the mesenteric glands, and the thoracic duct, into the left jugular vein, where we find the chyle is mixed with the venous blood, and carried to the right auricle of the heart. We must now consider how the fluids are conveyed to every part of the body, or we must examine the function of circulation.\n\nThis function takes place in all the vertebral animals, organs, and in mollusca, worms, and crustacea; but there appears to be no real circulation in insects, zoophytes, and plants.\n\nThe organs by which circulation is performed differ essentially in the several classes of animals. Those of the human system have been described in the first part of Anatomy, sect. x. and xi., and a brief comparative view of these organs in the inferior animals, has been given in the second part of that article, No. 154, 201\u2014204, 300, &c., and in the articles Cetology, Entomology, Ichthyology, and Ornithology. For a fuller account of these latter, we may refer to Cuvier's Lecons, &c., xxiv. and xxv., and to the Comparative Anatomy of Blumenbach, chap. xii.\n\nIt is well known that, in the red-blooded animals, the pulmonic blood is not of the same shade of red in every part of the body; but that what has passed through the lungs, and mic parts, is circulating through the arteries that proceed from the aorta, is of a florid red colour, while that which is sent to the lungs by the pulmonary artery, as well as that which is returning from the extremities of the arteries through the veins, is of a purple or crimson colour. As one fet of organs always contains fluid, and another fet always crimson blood, it is convenient to distinguish each fet by an appropriate name. Dr Barclay has done this, and he calls that fet of organs which are employed to convey the blood from the arteries, and distributed to the lungs, pulmonic, comprising the pulmonic veins, viz., the vena cava and its branches, pulmonic auricle, pulmonic ventricle, and pulmonic arteries; while he designates that fet of organs which return the blood from the lungs, and distribute it to the system, systemic, comprehending the systemic veins (pulmonary veins), systemic auricle, systemic ventricle, and systemic arteries, (the aorta and its ramifications). One great advantage of this nomenclature, is that it prevents the ambiguity of the expressions right and left, anterior and posterior, applied to the auricles and ventricles of the heart. We shall therefore employ them in the subsequent part of this chapter.*\n\nFor an account of the nature and properties of the blood, see Anatomy, Part I., sect. 14., and Chemistry, Motions, No. 2642.\n\nIt may not be improper, in this chapter, to notice the principal arguments that have been used to prove the circulation of the blood. They are as follow:\n\n1. When an artery is tied, the part of the artery that was betwixt the ligament and the heart, swells; but that part of it which is betwixt the ligature and the remote branches, becomes more flaccid than before. On the other hand, when a vein is tied, the part between the ligature...\ngature and the remote branches, swells, while the part between the ligature and the heart becomes flaccid.\n\n2. The valves placed at the mouths of the aorta and pulmonary artery, must prevent the blood from regurgitating into the ventricles, while they permit it to flow forward through the arteries, into the capillary branches of the veins. Again, the valves situated in the course of the veins prevent the blood from flowing back into the arteries, while they permit it to proceed forward through the venous trunks into the heart.\n\n3. By the assistance of a microscope, the blood may be seen in the pellucid parts of animals, as the feet of frogs, flowing from the arteries into the veins.\n\n4. When an artery of moderate size is wounded, and not secured by ligature or compression in proper time, the blood flows out till the animal be dead.\n\n5. Any thin liquid, when injected into an artery, does not pass backwards into the heart, but flows forward into the inoculating veins. On the other hand, such a liquid thrown into a vein, flows towards the heart, and not into the smaller branches of the vein.\n\nThe phenomena of circulation in the human body have been already mentioned under Anatomy, sect. xii. and xiii. and under Medicine, No. 95. We shall here only offer a compendious view of the course of the blood in the adult and in the fetal state.\n\nI. After birth, the blood coming from every part of the body through the numerous ramifications of the vena cava, is poured into the right or pulmonic auricle of the heart, by the contraction of which it is thrown into the right or pulmonic ventricle, which contracting, throws it into the pulmonary artery, being prevented from regurgitating into the auricle by the action of the tricuspid valves. It is now, by means of the ramifications of the pulmonary artery, distributed through the lungs, from which it is brought back by four principal pulmonary veins, and poured into the left or systemic ventricle, which contracting with great force, propels it into the aorta, it being prevented from regurgitating into the auricle by the action of the mitral valves. The blood being propelled into the aorta, is by its trunks and branches, distributed to every part of the body, and brought back as before by the ramifications and trunks of the vena cava.\n\nII. In the fetal state, the blood being brought back from every part of the body by the ramifications and trunks of the vena cava, is poured into the pulmonic auricle of the heart, where it is mixed with the blood brought from the placenta. A part of this blood is conveyed from the sinus of the auricle while in a state of dilatation, through the oval hole, into the systemic auricle; while another part, by the contraction of the auricle, is thrown into the pulmonic ventricle, which contracting, propels it into the root of the pulmonary artery. From this the greater part of the blood passes through the arterial canal, that in the fetus joins the pulmonary artery to the aorta, into this latter; while the remainder is distributed by the ramifications of the pulmonary artery to the lungs, and brought back by the pulmonary veins to the systemic auricle of the heart. By the contraction of this auricle, the blood is thrown into the systemic ventricle, which contracting, propels it into the aorta. Now, while one part of the blood is distributed by the numerous ramifications of the aorta to every part of the body of the fetus, another part is carried from the internal iliac arteries, through the two umbilical arteries, into the placenta, from which it is conveyed through the umbilical vein to the sinus of the liver. Hence, one part of the blood, without entering the liver, is transmitted by a branch of the umbilical vein, called venous duct, into the left branch of the vena cava hepatica; thence into the inferior great vena cava; while another part, by another branch of the umbilical vein, flows into the left branch of the vena porta, by the numerous ramifications of which it is distributed to the liver. From the liver it is carried by the vena cava hepatica into the inferior great vena cava, whence it is conveyed with the rest of the blood, to the pulmonic auricle of the heart, to be distributed as before.\n\nWe must now briefly consider the powers by which the blood is made to circulate through such a multitude lying on the vessels, so infinitely ramified, and differing so much in their diameter. It seems generally allowed at the present day, that these powers are chiefly the immediate muscular action of the heart, the action of the arteries, the valves of the veins, and the pressure produced on some of the veins by the action of the muscles that lie contiguous to them.\n\n1. That the heart must possess very considerable force in propelling the blood through the arteries, may be the heart. Supposed from the great muscularity of its ventricles; and this force has been proved by experiment and observation. From experiments made by Hales, viz. that of inserting a glass tube into a large artery, and measuring the height to which the blood ascends at each pulsation, it has been calculated, that the human carotid artery is capable of projecting its blood to a perpendicular height of seven feet and a half; and if we estimate the surface of the systemic ventricle at 15 square inches, we shall find that it sustains a pressure of 1350 cubic inches, equal to 51 pounds weight, which it has to overcome by its contracting force*. This is a moderate computation of the force of the heart, for Borelli estimates it at 180,000 pounds, while Keill diminishes it to eight ounces. Senac again, from having observed, vol. ii. that if a weight of 50 pounds be attached to the foot, with the knee of that side placed over the opposite knee, the weight will be raised at each pulsation, and allowing for the distance at which the weight is placed from the centre of motion, computes the force of the heart at 400 pounds\u2020. Blumenbach has seen the blood projected from the carotid of an adult more than five feet \u2021. On a medium calculation, estimating the quantity of blood contained in the body at 30 pounds, the number of pulsations in each minute at 75, and the quantity of blood ejected from the systemic ventricle at each contraction at two ounces and a half, we shall find that the whole 30 pounds of blood will be carried through the whole body no less than 23 times in an hour, or the circulation will be completed in less than three minutes. From these circumstances we must infer that the impelling power of the heart is very great, and fully adequate to the office which it has to perform.\n\nVarious hypotheses have been formed to explain how the heart and arteries are excited to motion, but our limits will not permit us to detail them. Our readers will find them related at considerable length, and fully examined in the Principes de Physiologie of Dumas, tom. iii.\nThe general opinion at present entertained on this subject is, that the heart is excited to action by the stimulus of the blood.\n\n2. Although it is more than probable that the action of the heart is the principal instrument in carrying on the circulation, there can be no doubt that the arteries contribute essentially to this office. They are evidently muscular, and are possessed of considerable irritability; are supplied with numerous nervous filaments, and are nourished by small arterial branches, commonly called vasa vasorum. Nay, we know that they are susceptible of contraction; for when we divide an artery in the living body, the divided extremities gradually contract, till, if the animal is not killed by the experiment, the aperture is at length obliterated*. Lastly, there have been instances of fetuses without a heart; and as we must suppose that, during the life of the fetus, the circulation was going on, it is a natural inference that this was chiefly effected by the contraction of the arteries, and not entirely by the impelling power of the circulating system of the mother.\n\n3. It cannot be supposed that the veins have any immediate action on the blood, as they exhibit no circular fibres like the arteries, except in the immediate vicinity of the heart; but their valvular structure must contribute to the carrying on of the circulation, from the opposition it gives to the return of the blood, so that what is called the vis a tergo, or impelling power from behind, aided by the conical form of the veins, may have its full effect.\n\n4. That the action of the muscles has considerable influence in propelling the blood towards the heart, in those veins that lie in their neighbourhood, is evident from the effect that bodily exercise produces in accelerating the circulation, and from the efficacy of friction in removing congestions of blood in the veins of the extremities, and in the more familiar instance of promoting the swelling of the veins of the arm by the same means in the operation of bleeding.\n\nThe circulation in those animals whose structure approaches to that of man, differs little from what is above described. There are indeed some peculiarities, a few of which we shall presently notice. An account of the circulation in the cetacea will be found in the article CETOLOGY, No. 140\u2014145, that of the reptiles is described under ERPETOLOGY, page 309.\n\nThe mollusca possess an evident and powerful circulation. Most of them have a simple heart, consisting of one auricle and one ventricle; and in these the vena cava performs the office of an artery, carrying the returning blood to the gills, whence it passes to the auricle, and is afterwards thrown into the aorta. There is a peculiarity in the cuttle fish, which has a heart consisting of three ventricles, without any part that can properly be called an auricle. Two of the ventricles are placed at the roots of the two bronchiae, and have each a branch of the vena cava, by which they receive the blood from the body, and propel it into the bronchiae. The returning veins open into the middle ventricle, and from this the aorta proceeds.\n\nSome of the vermes, as the leech, and the tribes of the naias, nereis, and aphrodisae, and some species of lumbricus, have no heart, but they have circulating vessels with evident contraction and dilatation.\n\nIn the crustacea, the circulation is performed by a single ventricle, expelling the blood into the arteries of the body, and receiving it again after it has passed through the gills, in a manner very similar to the circulation of fishes.\n\nThere is no circulation in insects; but these animals have running along the back a membranous tube, in which alternate contractions and dilatations are perceptible. This tube, however, is closed at both ends, and has no vessels proceeding from it.\n\nFrom the researches which evince circulation to be a function so general among animals, some are disposed to think it takes place in all living bodies. But notwithstanding the fashionable language of circulating fluids, of veins, arteries, and even of valves, in the vegetable structure; yet nothing performing the office of a heart, and nothing that seems to conduct fluids in a circular course, has been found in plants. In the vegetable kingdom, the chyle is distributed to all the parts, from the numerous vessels which convey the sap; and these vessels, being fitted by their structure to carry the sap either downwards or upwards, from the branches to the roots, or from the roots to the branches, is the reason why plants inverted in the ground will send forth roots from the place of their branches, and send forth branches from the place of their roots. Even a similar distribution of the chyle takes place in some animals. In the nor in some human tenia, in the fasciola hepatica (duke) of sheep, animals and in most polypes, the chyle, without a circulating system, is conveyed directly to the different parts from the alimentary canal.\n\nFor an account of the motion of sap in plants, see Darwin's Phytologia, a paper by Mr Knight in the Philosophical Transactions for 1801, Wildenow's Principles of Botany, sect. 276, and the article PLANT in this Encyclopaedia.\n\nThe relations that subsist between the function of circulation, and those which we have already considered, are very important. We shall begin with those of circulation and fission. That the functions of the nervous system must be considerably influenced by the circulation of the blood, may be supposed a priori, from the large quantity of blood sent to the head, this being, on a moderate calculation, about one-tenth of the whole. A certain quantity of blood in the vessels of the brain seems essential to the due performance of the functions of that organ; and those animals, which, like man, have the blood sent in greatest quantity, and with greatest impulse, seem to possess the faculties of the brain in the greatest perfection, while those in whom the motions of the blood towards the head is much retarded, as in the sheep and cow, are remarkable for mildness and stupidity. When, however, the quantity of blood becomes too great, or its impetus too violent, the faculties of the brain are impaired, or altogether destroyed. No man, and very few other animals, can remain suspended with the head downwards for any long time, without dangerous, and commonly fatal consequences. The bat, indeed, is a remarkable exception to this rule, for this animal can hang by its hinder feet for days or weeks together, with perfect safety, a circumstance that may be accounted for from the very small quantity of blood contained in its circulating vessels. Again, the brain exerts an evident influence on the circulation. It is well known how much the action of the heart and arteries is quickened, impeded, or rendered irregular, by the\nThe relations between the circulating and digestive organs are proved by the sudden acceleration of the pulse from stimuli received into the stomach; from the diminished circulation or sudden cessation of the heart's motion from powerful sedatives received into the same organ, especially the prunus lauro-cerasus; from the irregularity produced in the circulation in consequence of digestion, dyspepsia, and many other considerations.\n\nThat there is an intimate relation between circulation and absorption, cannot be doubted, though the nature and effects of this relation are not yet well understood. We know that the vessels sympathize with the absorbents in their activity or languor; that when the absorbents are languid in their action, the blood-vessels, especially the exhalants, are in a feeble or relaxed state, and that the absorbents are often roused to greater action by remedies that first act on the circulation.\n\nNumerous experiments have shown how much the action of colour and consistence of the blood are altered by the mere action of the vessels; and this discovery has enabled us to conjecture with more probability than we did formerly, why in infants and phlegmatic persons the blood is paler, in the choleric more yellow, and in the sanguine vermilion red. It explains likewise in some measure, why the blood varies in the same individual, not only with regard to the state of health, but likewise at the same instant; and why the blood which circulates through the veins has not the same intensity of colour, nor the same consistence, as that of the arteries; and why the blood which flows through the organs of the breast differs from that which passes languidly through the viscera of the lower belly. This power of the vessels over the blood will bring us also to the true cause why the vessels vary in the density of their coats and in their diameters; why they are sometimes convoluted in a gland, and why they sometimes deposit their contents in a follicle; why they are sometimes of a spiral form; why the branches strike off at various angles; why they are variously anastomosed; why they sometimes carry the blood with dispatch, and sometimes slowly through a thousand windings. By these means their action is varied, and the blood prepared numerous ways to answer the ends of nutrition and secretion.\n\nOn the varieties of the pulse, and the morbid affections of circulation, see Medicine, No. 96\u2014104.\n\nCHAP. VIII. Of Respiration.\n\nWhile the fluids are passing through the body, by necessity what is called the greater circulation, they give out certain parts or principles, partly for the purpose of nutrition, and partly to free the system from noxious matters. In order to regain some of the principles which they have lost, it is necessary that they should be exposed to the influence of atmospheric air; for which purpose they are made to pass through appropriate organs, which, as we have already observed, are in general either lungs or gills. The action by which the fluids and the air are made to act on each other, is called respiration, and consists of two kinds, inspiration, by which the air is received into the body, and expiration, by which it is again thrown out.\n\nSo essential is respiration to the system, that snails, chameleons, and some other animals, can live for years without any apparent nourishment, provided they be not excluded.\nWe have seen a chameleon that lived, and was vigorous, for 22 months, without any food, and which might have continued to live much longer, but for an unfortunate bruise by a fall.\n\nOther phenomena equally demonstrate the importance of air to the living body. The frog leaps away wanting its heart; it survives the loss of the greatest part of its spinal marrow; without its head, it lives for some days, and its heart continues to circulate its blood. Borelli found, that eels and serpents, though their bodies be opened, and the whole of their bowels be taken out, are able to move for a day after, and yet, in all these animals, the life is observed to be suddenly extinguished when the all-vivifying air is excluded. Even the smallest insect has died, and the plant lost its vegetative power, when retained for any considerable time in a vacuum. Fishes themselves, when placed under an exhausted receiver, have started anxiously to the surface of the water in quest of fresh air; and finding none, have sunk to the bottom and expired in convulsions. It will presently appear that this necessity of air to life is general in all the classes of organized beings (k).\n\nThe organs of respiration belonging to the human system, viz. the larynx, windpipe, lungs, diaphragm, ribs, and numerous muscles, have been sufficiently described in various parts of the article ANATOMY; and some account of these organs in the inferior animals has been given in the second part of that article, No 155, 156, 206, 208, 271\u2014274, and in the articles CETOLOGY, ERPETOLOGY, and ICHTHYOLOGY. For a more complete account of the respiratory organs in the inferior animals, the reader is referred to Cuvier's Legons d'Anatomie Comparee, Lec. xxvi. et xxvii. and to Blumenbach's Comparative Anatomy, chap. xiv. and xv.\n\nIn examining the function of respiration in warm-blooded animals, two circumstances are principally to be considered; the mechanism of respiration, or the mechanical means by which the organs are enabled to receive and expel the air, and the effects produced by respiration on the circulating fluids, and on the system at large. Our principal object in this article is briefly to explain the mechanism of respiration; to notice the effects produced on the air by the respiration of different animals, with the effects produced on them, and the relations that take place between respiration and the preceding functions of sensation, motion, digestion, and circulation.\n\nIn order to make an inspiration, the intercostal muscles, and the muscular fibres of the diaphragm, are thrown into contraction, while at the same time the abdominal muscles, and the muscular fibres of the windpipe, are relaxed. By these means the diaphragm being drawn towards the sacrum, and rendered less convex towards the chest, and the ribs being drawn upwards (or forwards in quadrupeds), the cavity of the chest is enlarged, and the air remaining in the lungs being raised, the external air rushes in through the windpipe by its own gravity, and distends the lungs. In making what is called a very deep inspiration, other muscles that are connected with the atlantal ribs, viz. those called scaleni, trapezius, cervicale descendentes, serrati superiores, and pectoral muscles, assist to elevate the ribs more than in an ordinary inspiration. By the action of the intercostal muscles the ribs are drawn atlantad (upwards in man, and forwards in quadrupeds), because the most atlantal rib on each side of the thorax is fixed, and therefore all the other ribs are drawn towards it; and they are also drawn peripherad (outwards), because their greater curvature is in the direction of the sacrum, and because they turn on their vertebral extremities as on a fulcrum.\n\nIn order to make an expiration, the abdominal muscles, and the muscular fibres of the windpipe, are contracted, while the intercostal muscles, and the muscular fibres of the diaphragm are at the same time relaxed. By these means, aided by the elasticity of the cartilages of the ribs, and perhaps of the mediastinum, the ribs are drawn sacrad (towards the sacrum), while the diaphragm, partly by its own muscular action, and partly in consequence of the pressure of the bowels, is rendered convex towards the chest. Thus, this cavity is considerably diminished, the lungs are compressed, and part of the air is expelled through the windpipe. In making a strong expiration, little more is necessary than a more powerful contraction of the abdominal muscles.\n\nThe mechanism of respiration in mammalia is similar to that of man, that we need not enter into it; animals that of cetacea has been sufficiently explained under CETOLOGY, No 146\u2014151; that of birds may be gathered from what has been said on their structure, in the comparative part of ANATOMY, No 271, and in ORNITHOLOGY, No 37; that of reptiles has been fully explained under ERPETOLOGY, page 311; and that of fishes under ICHTHYOLOGY, page 73. The mechanism of this function in the classes of animals below these is so simple, that a consideration of it is unnecessary. In insects the air enters the numerous ramifications of the tracheae; is carried by them into every part of the body, and is then returned by the same passages. In some of the mollusca, respiration proceeds in a similar manner, by the ramifications of the pulmonary vessels that enter by the neck; but in most of these, and in all the lowest tribes, such as worms and zoophytes, respiration seems to be carried on entirely by the pores of the skin.\n\nMany attempts have been made to ascertain the quantity of air received and emitted in a single inspiration or expiration. See CHEMISTRY, No 2535. This point is not yet fully ascertained, but we may probably estimate the quantity expelled by each ordinary expiration at one-seventh part of the whole contents of the lungs, and that of the most violent expiration at about four-sevenths.\n\n(k) It was long ago observed by Pliny, that if the bodies of insects are besmeared with oil, they soon perish: \"oleo illito infecta omnia exanimantur.\" The same observation was afterwards made by Ray, who explained it by showing that in this way the pores through which the animals breathe are stopped. Mayow also found, that if the oil be applied only to some of these pores, the neighbouring parts become paralytic, while the rest of the body continued found. See Ray's Wisdom of God, and Mayow's Tractatus.","sp":99,"ep":104},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Of respiration of air consumed during a common inspiration or expiration is about 40 cubic inches.*\n\nAnother circumstance respecting the mechanism of respiration merits notice, viz., the ordinary number of respirations made in a minute by a healthy person. This varies considerably in different subjects, being in general greatest in children, and least in old persons. Dr Hales estimated the number of 20 in a minute; the subject of Dr Menzies' experiments respired only 14 times in the same period, while Mr Davy reckons his respirations at between 26 and 27; the subject of the experiments made by Mefris Allen and Pepys, breathed about 19 times in a minute, and with this Dr Thomson's experience agrees. The average of all these is about 22, which we may probably consider as a tolerably just estimate. Much, however, will depend on the circumstances in which the person is placed; on his habits of activity or indolence, of temperance or intemperance; on the state of the atmosphere, &c.\n\nThe chemical changes produced on the air by the respiration of animals have been described, so far as they were then known, under CHEMISTRY, No. 2536. Since that article was written, however, several valuable observations have been published, and the most important of these must be here noticed; but as we cannot, in this place, give any thing more than a summary sketch of these observations, we shall here enumerate the principal works that have appeared on this experimental part of our subject. The chemical physiologists who have been most conspicuous in these researches are, Mayow (in his Tractatus de Respiratione, or the Analysis of his works by Beddoes); Priestley (Experiments and Observations on Air); Lavoisier (Trait\u00e9 Elementaire de Chimie, Physique et Chimique \u00c9l\u00e9mens, and a work on Atmospheric Air); Goodwyn (On the Connection of Life with Respiration); Coleman (On Suspended Respiration); Menzies (On Respiration); Spallanzani (Memoires sur la Respiration, translated into French by Sen\u00e9bier, and since into English, and Rapports de l'Aire avec les \u00c9tres Organis\u00e9s, &c. also collected by Sen\u00e9bier); Davy (Researches Philosophical and Chemical, into the Nature of Nitrous Oxide; Ellis (Inquiry into the Effects produced on Atmospheric Air by Respiration), and Allen and Pepys (Philosophical Transactions, 1828, Part II. or Phil. Mag. vol. xxxii.). Most of the facts observed by these experimentalists, except those of the three last mentioned, have been collected by Dr Bottock, in his Essay on Respiration, by Dr Thomson in his System of Chemistry, vol. v. third edition, and by Mr Johnson in his Animal Chemistry, vol. iii.\n\nThe following changes produced on air that has been respired by warm-blooded animals, seem to have been fully ascertained; viz., 1. That the respired air generally suffers a sensible diminution of bulk; 2. That it loses a part of its oxygenous portion; 3. That it acquires an additional quantity of carbonic acid gas; 4. That it is charged with watery vapour. We shall resume these facts, and consider the additional information which has been acquired respecting them since the publication of our article CHEMISTRY.\n\n1. Atmospheric air generally suffers, by the respiration of warm-blooded animals, a sensible diminution in its bulk.\u2014The results of the experiments made by different chemists on the diminished volume of respired air, are exceedingly various. Mr Davy makes the diminution amount to one-eighth of the whole air inspired; Lavoisier and Goodwin estimate it at no more than one-twentieth, and Dr Bottock so low as one-eightiethth. Crawford and some later experimentalists could perceive no diminution. Dr Thomson states the results of his experiments upon this subject to be, that in some cases he could perceive no diminution at all, while in others it was perceptible. It was greatest when the animal was taken out repeatedly during the experiment, or when he employed air purer than that of the atmosphere. He is disposed to consider the diminution as accidental, and as owing to some absorption of air, altogether independent of respiration, and exceedingly various in different circumstances. In the experiments of Messieurs Allen and Pepys, the general average of the deficiency in the total amount of common air inspired, appeared to be very small, amounting to about six parts in 1000, and they are inclined to attribute it, in a great measure to the difficulty of exhausting the lungs so completely after an experiment as before it.\n\n2. Atmospheric air, by the respiration of warm-blooded animals, loses a part of its oxygen.\u2014From a comparison of the experiments of Mr Davy, with those made by Lavoisier just before his death, Dr Thomson estimates the quantity of oxygen consumed in a minute, by respiration, at 31.6 cubic inches, making in 24 hours 45,504 cubic inches; and he concludes that in a day a man consumes rather more than 25 cubic feet of oxygen, and that he renders unfit in the same time, for Chemistry, supporting combustion and respiration, no less than 121 cubic feet of air.\n\n3. Atmospheric air acquires, by respiration, an additional quantity of carbonic acid gas.\u2014The opinion of acid gas as Dr Menzies, that the bulk of carbonic acid gas procured by respiration, is precisely equal to that of the oxygen lost, appears now to be fully confirmed. In Mr Davy's experiments they corresponded very nearly, and in those of Mr Dalton and Dr Thomson, they corresponded exactly. The latter chemist found, on the whole, that the bulk of oxygen which disappeared was somewhat greater than that of the carbonic acid generated; but the difference varied considerably, and kept pace with the diminution of the bulk of air respired. Hence he considers it as owing to the abstraction of part of the air by some other way than respiration, and allowing for this abstraction, he has no doubt that the bulk of the carbonic acid formed is precisely equal to that of the oxygen that has disappeared. He is disposed to consider the absolute quantity of carbonic acid generated in 24 hours, as something less than 40,000 cubic inches on an average. The following results of the experiments made by Messieurs Allen and Pepys, as there were made on a large scale, may be considered as quite satisfactory on this head. 1. It appears that the quantity of carbonic acid gas emitted is exactly equal, bulk for bulk, to the oxygen consumed. 2. Atmospheric air once entering the lungs, returns charged with from 8 to 8.5 per cent. carbonic acid gas, and when the contacts are repeated almost as frequently as possible, only 10 per cent. is emitted. When the inspirations and expirations are more rapid than usual, a larger quantity of carbonic acid is emitted in a given time; but the proportion is nearly the same, or about eight\neight per cent. The proportions of carbonic acid gas, in the first and last portions of a deep inspiration, differ as widely as from 3.5 to 9.5 per cent. It appears that a middle-sized man, aged about 28 years, and whose pulse is 70 on an average, gives off 302 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas from his lungs in 11 minutes; and supposing the production uniform for 24 hours, the total quantity in that period would be 39,534 cubic inches, (agreeing almost exactly with Dr Thomson's estimate) weighing 18,683 grains, the carbuncle in which is 5363 grams, or rather more than 11 ounces troy; the oxygen consumed in the same time will be equal in volume to the carbonic acid gas; but it is evident, that the quantity of carbonic acid gas emitted in a given time, must depend very much upon the circumstances under which respiration is performed; and here it may be proper to notice, that all these experiments were made between breakfast and dinner. A larger proportion of carbonic acid gas is formed by the human subject, from oxygen than from atmospheric air.\n\n4. Atmospheric air returns from the lungs charged with aqueous vapour.\u2014Of this circumstance there is no doubt, but the quantity of water contained in the expired air, and the sources from which it is derived, are still in dispute. Dr Thomson estimates the former at about 19 ounces per day; but he does not lay much stress on the results of his own experiments, as they were not sufficiently varied to give a fair average. As to the sources of this watery vapour, it has been generally supposed, that the water is formed in the lungs by a combination of part of the oxygen consumed with hydrogen evolved from the venous blood. This, however, is mere hypothesis. It has not been proved that hydrogen is evolved from the blood; and as the quantity of oxygen consumed appears to be taken up in forming the carbonic acid gas that is expired, there is none left to form water. No hydrogen, or any other gas, except carbonic acid and azotic gas, appear to be evolved during the process of respiration.\n\nThere is another change supposed by most chemical physiologists, to be produced on the air by respiration, namely the loss of part of its azote; but this is still disputed. Dr Boffrost concludes it to be probable, that a small portion of azote is lost, which he estimates on an average at \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of the air respired, making in 24 hours, about 4.5 ounces, or four cubic feet. Mr Davy found the consumption of azote to amount to about one seventh of that of oxygen; and some late experiments of Dr Henderson afford a similar result, though in these the proportion is rather less. Dr Thomson also found a loss of azote, but it was extremely inconstant, sometimes being scarcely perceptible, at others considerable. It kept pace with the diminution of the bulk of the air respired, and with the difference between the bulk of the oxygen consumed, and the carbonic acid formed. He conceives that a portion of the air respired disappears without undergoing any change, and that this portion occasions the diminution of the azote, and the difference between the bulk of the carbonic acid formed, and that of the oxygen consumed. He thinks it conceivable, that the disappearing of such a portion may be confined to the unnatural circumstances occasioned by the experiment; that the difficulty of throwing out the air from the lungs in these circumstances, may be such as to induce absorbents to act, and remove a portion which in the ordinary state of the lungs would have been thrown out by expiration.\n\nExperiments on the changes produced on atmospheric air and oxygenous gas, by the respiration of the inferior animals, have been made chiefly by Vauquelin, Spallanzani, and Mr Davy, and some of them have been repeated and varied by Mr D. Ellis. From all these experiments we find, that, by the respiration of amphibia, fishes, insects, mollusca, and of worms, the air in which they have been confined suffers changes analogous to those produced in it by the respiration of the warm-blooded animals; that the oxygenous part is diminished, and that this diminution is most complete when insects and worms have been confined in it; that carbonic acid gas is in all cases produced, but that the quantity produced varies in different animals, that fishes live for the shortest time, and amphibia and worms for the longest, when confined in a certain quantity.\n\nFrom the latest experiments made by Spallanzani, on the effects both of living and dead animals, on atmospheric air, as collected by Senebier, that experimentalist has drawn the following conclusions. 1. In beginning with worms, and rising up to man, there is no species of animal which does not destroy the oxygen of the atmosphere after death, and destroy it entirely if it be kept inclosed in it, provided the quantity be not too great in proportion to the size of the animal; because a considerable time is required when the volume of air is large, and a less time when the quantity is small.\n\n2. This destruction of oxygen by dead animals, is under similar circumstances slower than that effected by living animals, if we regard merely the effects produced by the cutaneous organ, independent of the action of the lungs.\n\n3. He thought he had legitimately proved, that the destruction of oxygen by the cutaneous organ, is not occasioned by the combination of this gas with the carbuncle of the animal; but that it is a true absorption of that element, by the body of the animal deprived of life. It does not give out carbuncle, but carbonic acid, as he believed he had proved by unanswerable experiments.\n\n4. The absorption of oxygen by animals cut into small pieces, is greater than that occasioned by animals entire in similar circumstances.\n\n5. A cold blooded animal of the same bulk, and in the same circumstances as a warm-blooded animal, absorbs more oxygen than the latter after death.\n\n6. The skin is not the only part of an animal which absorbs oxygen; all the parts, solid, fluid, and soft, not excepting the driest horny parts, as the nails of quadrupeds, the bill and feet of birds, produce the same effect.\n\nIt has long been known that plants would not vegetate, if excluded from atmospheric air. Papin confined vegetation an entire plant in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, on the air, and it soon perished; but on keeping a similar plant in this vacuum, with only its leaves exposed to the air, it continued to live for a long time. When the leaves of a plant are stript off, or blighted by insects; when Phytophthora, they have the upper surface smeared with oil, with varnish, or laid upon water, the plant dies in a few days. Hence it is evident that the leaves of a plant are necessary organs, and that there is produced on the air in which\nof which the plant vegetates, some change essential to the healthy action of the plant. What this change is, has not been fully ascertained. It is the general opinion, that the leaves absorb a portion of the atmosphere, and give out certain gaseous products; and it is generally believed, that most plants have the property of giving out oxygenous gas during their exposure to the light, and azotic gas or some other irrespirable air in the dark. That oxygenous gas is necessary to vegetation, is fully proved; and it seems certain, especially from the experiments of Mr Ellis, that under the ordinary circumstances, carbonic acid gas is generated during their vegetation*. Mr Ellis, who is not satisfied with the accuracy of the experiments of Scheele and Priestley, seems to doubt whether plants at any time give out oxygenous gas; and thinks that the principal use of oxygen to them, is to combine with the superfluous carbure produced by vegetation, and thus form the carbonic acid evolved.\n\nHaving considered the effects produced on the air by the respiration of animals, and the vegetation of plants, we must now notice the effects produced by the exercise of the same function on the animal body, as the comparison of these effects with the changes produced on the air itself, affords us the only clue to a rational theory of respiration.\n\nWe have already stated (Chemistry 234), that during respiration, the blood changes from the dark colour which it has in the veins, to the bright scarlet of arterial blood. It has been found, that a clot of venous blood, when out of the body, assumes the bright tinge, when exposed to the action of oxygenous gas; and that venous blood confined within a bladder, undergoes a similar change, when the bladder is immersed in oxygenous gas. It has been also found, that when arterial blood out of the body is exposed to the action of irrespirable gases, it loses its bright colour, and assumes the purple hue of venous blood.\n\nIt is fully ascertained, that the heat of the body is chiefly kept up by respiration, See Chemistry, No 2345.\n\nLet us now consider the most probable theories of respiration, chiefly as they are applicable to the human system. Without flaying to notice the older hypotheses that have been advanced to explain this function, we shall only state the present most received doctrine, and mention the objections that have been lately made to it.\n\nThis doctrine is stated in the following manner by Dr Boltock, one of its most strenuous defenders. \"The blood arises at the right side of the heart, in a venalized state, loaded with a quantity of the oxide of carbure; as it passes through the pulmonary vessels, it becomes subjected to the action of the air contained in the bronchial cells; a portion of the oxygen is removed from the air, part of which, forming an intimate union with the oxide of carbure, is expelled in the form of carbonic acid gas, while the remainder is dissolved in the blood.\" It is here necessary to remark, that it is not oxygenous gas, but oxygen, which is supposed to be mixed with the blood. The calorific thus set at liberty is employed, part of it in maintaining the temperature of the lungs, which would otherwise be cooled by the admission of the external air; part of it in carrying off the aqueous vapour, and another portion in converting the carbonic acid into carbonic acid gas; but the greatest part of it is united, in the form of specific heat, to the arterial blood, which, by becoming arterialized, has its capacity for heat increased. The arterial blood is poured into the left cavity of the heart, and propelled through the arteries into the extreme parts of the body. The oxygen which was diffused in the whole mass of blood, during the circulation, gradually unites itself more intimately to a portion of the carbure in it, which it converts into the oxide of carbure, and thus the blood acquires the venous tinge. By this change, its capacity for caloric is diminished; the specific heat which it obtained in the lungs, is given out in the capillary vessels, to keep up the temperature of the body, and the blood returns to the right side of the heart completely venalized. This hypothesis is nearly similar to the one which was propounded by M. M. La Grange and Hafnianitz; it received some modifications from Mr Allen of Edinburgh, and was delivered by him nearly in the form which I have stated above, in his admirable course of physiological lectures. It was, I believe, first published in my Essay on Respiration*.\"\n\nThis doctrine, if sufficiently established, would explain the manner in which the blood becomes arterialized in the course of the circulation. It would also show how, under particular circumstances, the arterial blood may be venalized without leaving the arteries, and the venous blood arterialized without leaving the veins. It accounts for the gradual evolution of caloric in the capillary vessels, during the course of the circulation, by the union which takes place between the oxygen and the carbure; whereas in the other hypotheses, (see No 241.) this union is entirely completed in the lungs. It would allow a considerable time in which this union might be accomplished, and would likewise suppose the constituent parts to remain in perfect contact for an indefinite period. This hypothesis would also explain how the oxygen is disposed of, which is supposed not to be concerned in the formation of carbonic acid, and would likewise suppose the advantage of supposing the existence of a surplus quantity of oxygen, which being carried along the circulation, might be expended in a variety of useful purposes in the different parts of the animal economy. It would show how the supply of matter which is poured into the blood by the absorbents, is gradually incorporated with the mass; and after the separation of that portion, which is necessary for repairing the waste of the different organs, the remainder is united to oxygen, and keeps up the temperature of the body; and, having afterwards no farther useful purpose to serve, it is discharged by the lungs\u2020.\n\nSeveral objections, however, may be made to this theory. It is not proved that there is in natural respiration any absorption of oxygen by the blood; for though much of the oxygenous portion of the atmosphere is lost, the quantity of carbonic acid generated is sufficient to account for it. Mr Ellis has lately made very strong objections to this supposed absorption of oxygen, drawn chiefly from the anatomical structure of the blood vessels, and of the bronchial cells. He contends that the coats of the former, and the membranes bounding the latter, can scarcely admit the passage of air through them, much less that of the solid basis of oxygenous gas, which basis Dr Boltock supposes to be the principle absorbed. It is still more improbable, according to Mr Ellis, that two solid bases, namely those of oxygenous gas, and of oxide of carbure, should be at the same time passing through\nthrough these resisting membranes; a supposition that is necessary in the hypothesis just stated. Again, supposing that this absorption of oxygen should take place, from the affinity of the blood for this principle, it is not easy to conceive why this affinity should so soon cease, and why the blood should again part with the oxygen, to the base of carbonic oxide. These objections are certainly very forcible; let us see how they have been answered.\n\nDr Bostock, in an ingenious reply to Mr Ellis's objections, in invalidation of the first objection, quotes the well-known experiment of Dr Priestley, mentioned in No. 235, that venous blood becomes changed when exposed to oxygenous gas, even though a bladder be interposed between them; and in controverting the rest, he seems chiefly to rely on the supposition that a greater quantity of oxygen is consumed than is taken up in the formation of the carbonic acid. He also does not consider it as necessary to suppose that either the oxygenous gas, or the oxygen itself, should enter the blood vessels, and should afterwards be expelled from them; but only that a part of the oxygen should be attracted by the blood, and after entering into a variety of new combinations, should be discharged as a constituent of some of these new compounds. Without inquiring in what way the action between the blood and oxygen takes place; whether it be in consequence of the mechanical structure of the membranes, which permits the oxygen to pass through their pores, or whether it be owing to the affinity of the blood for oxygen, which causes it as it were to become saturated with this substance before it transmits it; it appears to him sufficient to state, that oxygen and blood can act on each other, through a membrane which is very much thicker, and probably much denser, than that which separates the blood in the lungs from the air in the bronchial cells.\n\nFrom a consideration of the principal experiments on respiration that have been made by the ablest chemical physiologists, and a comparison of these with what he has himself made, Mr Ellis contends that no part of the air enters into the blood, but all the oxygen which disappears is to be found in the carbonic acid produced; and that this carbonic acid is formed by the union of carburetted oxygen with the exhalant vesicles of the lungs, uniting with part of the oxygenous portion of the inspired air.\n\nTo this opinion Dr Bostock, in the paper already referred to, makes the following objections; that this opinion does not explain how the regular supply of carburetted oxygen is, at each successive circulation, brought to the lungs in a state proper to be discharged; and that it does not explain in what way the oxygen is employed, which is consumed in respiration.\n\nTo the first of these objections (which, if it be proved that the whole of the oxygen is taken up in forming carbonic acid, is the only objection that can properly lie against his opinion), Mr Ellis replies, that the supply of carburetted oxygen is derived from the digestive organs; but he does not conceive, as Dr Bostock seems to imagine, that this is no sooner received into the blood than excreted, or that the first operation which takes place in the vascular system after it has received the substance which is to afford nutriment to the body, is to discharge the greatest part of it. He regards carburetted oxygen as a constituent part of the animal fluids, and he has endeavoured to shew, that it is emitted by the exhalants of the skin and intestines, as well as by those of the lungs, producing in all cases similar changes on the air. Digestion he holds to be in no other way the source of the carburetted oxygen in these fluids, than as it is the source of all the other principles which they contain. We know that all the phenomena of respiration are often exhibited for long periods where no digestive process is carried on; but the functions of life must sooner or later come to an end, if the various means of exhaustion be not recruited by supplies through the digestive organs. It is only in this distant view that he considers digestion as the source of carburetted oxygen; its immediate sources are the exhalant functions of the body, which will afford carburetted oxygen as long as they are supported by the motion of the blood, and will no longer yield it when the motion of the blood has ceased. But whether the exhalant functions continue or cease, he considers that carburetted oxygen exists abundantly, if not equally, in the serum and lymphaticum, in arterial and venous blood.\n\nOn the whole, though the final causes of respiration, theory of the uses to which it is subservient in the animal economy, are now pretty well understood, we must acknowledge that the mode in which these beneficial effects are produced, has not yet been satisfactorily explained.\n\nThe principal uses of respiration appear to be, 1. To bring about some beneficial change in the fluids of the body, and through them on the folds; 2. To preserve the equable temperature of the body; and 3. In all those animals that breathe by lungs to produce those sounds which arise from what we call voice.\n\nThat animal heat is kept up chiefly by respiration, requires we think, no particular proof. It is well known, that those animals which consume most air during respiration, have the highest temperature. Birds in particular have the most extensive breathing organs, and the temperature of these animals is higher than that of any other class. The respiration of reptiles, fishes, and most of the lower classes, is slow and languid, and the temperature of these animals is proportionally low. The heat of each species is, however, pretty uniform under ordinary circumstances. That of the human body is generally about 98\u00b0 Fahrenheit. This however depends on the circumstances in which it is placed. When much chilled by the action of cold, the temperature of the human body falls a degree or two below the ordinary height; and under the influence of violent fever, it rises several degrees above it. The temperature is generally highest in children; and instances are recorded of these having survived, while their mothers, to whose breasts they clung, have perished from the severity of cold.\n\nOne of the most interesting facts relating to the subject of animal heat, is the capacity of preserving the equable temperature of their bodies, possessed by most animals. Man himself can live with little inconvenience in the frozen regions of Spitzbergen, and under the equatorial heats of Africa. He can even support a greater degree of heat than is perhaps ever known to take place from the rays of the sun, as is proved by the experiment of Drs Blagden and Fordyce in heated rooms; these gentlemen having remained for 15 minutes together in a heat exceeding 133\u00b0. The heat supported by some of the inferior animals is still more extraordinary. A dog has been known to live for a considerable time in air heated to 260\u00b0, and still the heat of his body was not raised more than 2\u00b0 above its natural standard. A frog has lived for more than 25 minutes when laid on flannel,\nof mel, heated from $95^\\circ$ to $105^\\circ$. Fishes live very well at Respiration, $72^\\circ$; and Lucas, in his history of mineral waters, speaks of carp that were living in a hot bath, whose temperature was at least equal to that of the human body.\n\nHow this equable temperature is preserved, cannot be completely explained. We know that the heat of the human body is commonly moderated by perspiration; but in some cases, as in that of Dr Fordyce alluded to above, where the heated atmosphere was filled with watery vapour, this could have little effect. We can ascribe it only to the action of the living principle.\n\nIt was long ago observed by Aristotle, that those animals only who puff their lungs, have a true voice, and this opinion is confirmed by the experience of modern naturalists. We find, that only mammalia, cetacea, birds, reptiles and serpents, can utter vocal sounds. Several tribes below these do indeed emit certain sounds, especially insects; but they are owing to vibrations of the air in consequence of the agitation of their external organs. It is only in mammalia and birds that the voice becomes an interesting object of enquiry; for that of the cetacea is little more than blowing and grunting, and that of the other two classes is either hissing or croaking.\n\nNothing can exceed, in variety and execution, the human voice; as will readily be allowed, if we consider the complicated structure of the human vocal organs, and the almost infinite variety of changes of which they are susceptible. Dr Barclay has calculated these with great accuracy, proceeding on the principle, that where a number of moveable parts constitutes an organ defined to some particular function, and where this function is varied and modified by every change in the relative situation of the moveable parts, the number of changes producible on the organ must at least equal the number of muscles employed, together with all the combinations into which they can enter. Now, the muscles proper to the five cartilages of the larynx, are at least seven pairs; and fourteen muscles that can act separately or in pairs, in combination with the whole, or with any two or more of the rest, are capable of producing 16,383 different movements; not reckoning as changes the various degrees of force and velocity, nor the infinitely varied order of succession by which they may occasionally be brought into action. The number appears almost incredible; but to lessen the surprize, it must be recollected that we speak not here of the powers possessed by any individual, which will depend on habits and circumstances, but of the powers of the vocal organs, considered in the abstract, free from all the influence of custom, equally indifferent, and equally disposed to act in any order of succession, in any combination, and with any degree of force and velocity of which their original powers were susceptible.\n\nIf the powers we have mentioned appear astonishing, and able to account for many thousands of these varieties observed among the voices of the human species, we have further to add, that the muscles alluded to are only the proper muscles of the larynx, or the muscles restricted in their attachments to its five cartilages. There are but a few of the muscles of voice. In speaking we use a great many more. Fifteen pairs of different muscles, attached to the cartilages, or os hyoidei, and acting as agents, antagonists, or directors, are constantly employed in preserving the cartilages of the larynx steady, in regulating the place of their situation, or moving them as occasion requires, upwards and downwards, backwards and forwards, and in every way, directly and obliquely, according to the course of the muscular fibres, or in the diagonal between different forces. These muscles, independent of the former, are susceptible of 1,073,741,823 different combinations; and co-operating with the seven pairs of the larynx, of 17,592,186,044,415, exclusive of the changes which must arise from the different degrees of force and velocity, and the infinitely varied order of succession in which they may be brought into action.\n\nBut these are not all that co-operate with the larynx, either in forming or changing the voice; the diaphragm, the abdominal muscles, the intercostals, and all that directly or indirectly act on the air, or on the parts to which the chondral and hyoidal muscles are attached, contribute their share. The os hyoidei could not be raised unless the inferior jaw-bone were previously fixed by the temporals, mastoids, and internal pterygoids; and a similar assistance is likewise furnished by several other auxiliary muscles that fix the head, sternum, and scapula; to these we must add some pairs belonging to the pharynx and styloides faucium, and some also belonging to the tongue, which, combining with others, give to that organ an inconceivable variety of movement; and so quickly, that, in rapid utterance, they change its state 3000 times in a minute. Thus Haller could articulate 1500 letters in a minute, which required 1500 contractions, and as many relaxations of the lingual muscles.\n\nThe principal organ of voice is the larynx, which is mechanism proved by the circumstance that, when this is injured, voice is either lost, or rendered very indistinct. In speech, ordinary respiration the chink of the glottis seems to be in a relaxed state, and when this chink is contracted, voice is produced, and the sound of the voice is more or less shrill, according as the glottis is more or less contracted. By this contraction of the glottis alone we can produce only inarticulate sounds, varied indeed almost infinitely with respect to intensity and tone, by the action of the muscles. The production of speech requires the action of the tongue, the lips, the palate, and the teeth; and the articulations are most complete, when all these parts are most perfect in their structure, and in the most healthy condition. Too great length or shortness of the tongue, swelling of this organ in consequence of inflammation, &c. imperfection of the palate, loss of the teeth, swelling of the lips, all serve to render speech imperfect and inarticulate. The strength of the voice depends on the quantity of air expired, and on the contraction of the glottis; and consequently those animals who have the most capacious and most dilatable lungs, together with an ample cartilaginous and elastic larynx, will, other things being equal, have the strongest voice.\n\nAmong the various effects of the human voice, there is none more calculated to produce surprize in the hearers, than that extraordinary talent which some men profess of deceiving their hearers into a belief, that the sounds which they utter do not proceed from the real speaker, but from situations at a distance. This talent has been termed ventriloquism, from an idea that the voice of the speaker proceeded not from the mouth, but from the belly. The most remarkable instance of this rare talent of which we have heard, is that of M. Fitz-James, who was formerly at Paris, and exhibited in London in the year 1803. Mr Nicholson has given an amusing\namusing account of the performance of this ventriloquism, which we shall notice presently, and on the difficulty of ascertaining the direction of the sound, Mr Nicholson thus proceeds:\u2014\u201cWe should scarcely be disposed to ascribe any definite direction to it; and consequently are readily led to suppose it to come from the place best adapted to what was said. So that when he went to the door, and asked in French (in which the whole performance was carried on), \u2018are you there?\u2019 to a person supposed to be in the passage, the answer in the unusual voice was immediately ascribed by the audience to a person actually in the passage; and upon shutting the door and withdrawing from it, when he turned round, directing his voice to the door, and said, \u2018stay there till I call you,\u2019 the answer which was lower, and well adapted to the supposed distance, and obstacle interposed, appeared still more strikingly to be out of the room. He then looked up to the ceiling and called out in his own voice, \u2018what are you doing above?\u2019 \u2018do you intend to come down?\u2019 to which an immediate answer was given, which seemed to be in the room above, \u2018I am coming down directly.\u2019 The same deception was practised on the supposition of a person being under the floor, who answered in the unusual, but a very different voice from the other, that he was down in the cellar putting away some wine. An excellent deception of the watchman crying the hour in the street, and approaching nearer the house, till he came opposite the window, was practised. Our attention was directed to the street by the marked attention which Fitz-James himself appeared to pay to the sound. He threw up the latch and asked the hour, which was immediately answered in the same tone, but clearer and louder; but on his shutting the window down again, the watchman proceeded less audibly, and all at once the voice became very faint, and Fitz-James in his natural voice said, \u2018he has turned the corner.\u2019 In all these instances as well as others which were exhibited to the very great entertainment and surprise of the audience, the acute observer will perceive that the direction of the sound was imaginary, and arose entirely from the well-studied and skilful combinations of the performer. Other scenes which were to follow required the imagination to be too completely misled to admit of the actor being seen. He went behind a folding screen in one corner of the room, when he counterfeited the knocking at a door. One person called from within, and was answered by a different person from without, who was admitted, and we found from the conversation of the parties, that the latter was in pain, and desirous of having a tooth extracted. The dialogue, and all the particulars of the operation that followed, would require a long discourse if I were to attempt to describe them to the reader. The imitation of the natural and modulated voice of the operator, encouraging, soothing, and talking with the patient; the confusion, terror, and apprehension of the sufferer; the inarticulate noises produced by the chairs and apparatus, upon the whole, constituted a mass of sound which produced a strange but comic effect. Some observers would not have hesitated to assert, that they heard more than one voice at a time; and though this certainly could not be the case, and it did not appear so to me, yet the transitions were so instantaneous, without the least pause between them, that the notion might very easily be generated. The removal of the screen satisfied the audience that one performer had effected the whole.\n\nHis principal performance, however, consisted in the debates at the meeting of Nantes, in which there were twenty different speakers, and certainly the number of different voices was very great. Much entertainment was afforded by the subject, which was taken from the late times of anarchy and convulsion in France; when the lowest, the most ignorant part of society, was called upon to decide the fate of a whole people by the energies of folly and brute violence. The same remark may be applied to this debate, as to the other scene respecting tooth-drawing; namely, that the quick and sudden transitions, and the great differences in the voices, gave the audience various notions, as well with regard to the number of speakers, as to their positions and the direction of their voices.\u201d\n\nVarious explanations of this peculiar modification of voice have been given. From the report of Fitz-James himself, it appeared to Mr Nicholson, that by long practice he had acquired the faculty of speaking during the inspiration of the breath, with nearly the same articulation, though not so loud, nor so variously modulated, as the ordinary voice, formed by expiration of the air. M. Richerand, who heard Fitz-James at Paris, gives a different account of the matter. He says that every time the ventriloquist exerted this unusual peculiarity, he suffered distention in the epiglottic region; that sometimes he perceived the wind rolling even lower, and that he could not long continue the exertion without fatigue. Richerand believes that the whole mechanism of this art consists in a slow, gradual expiration, drawn in such a way, that the artifl either makes use of the influence exerted by volition over the muscles of the parietes of the thorax, or that he keeps the epiglottis down by the base of the tongue, the apex of which is not carried beyond the dental arches.\n\nHe always made a strong inspiration just before this long expiration, and thus conveyed into the lungs a considerable mass of air, the exit of which he afterwards managed with such address. Therefore repulsion of the stomach greatly incommode the talent of M. Fitz-James, by preventing the diaphragm from descending sufficiently to admit of a dilatation of the thorax, in proportion to the quantity of air that the lungs should receive. By accelerating or retarding the exit of the air, he can imitate different voices, and induce his auditors to a belief, that the interlocutors of a dialogue kept up by himself alone, are placed at different distances.\n\nMr Gough in an ingenious paper, containing an investigation of the method whereby men judge, by the ear, of the position of sonorous bodies, relative to their own persons, explains the phenomena of ventriloquism, on the principles of reverberated sound, and considers it as consisting in the talent of making the voice issue only from the mouth; whereas he thinks that in ordinary cases the different vibrations which are excited by the joint functions of the several vocal organs in action, pass along the bones and cartilages from the parts in motion, to the external teguments of the head, face, neck, and chest, from which a succession of similar vibrations is imparted to the contiguous air, thereby converting the upper half of the speaker\u2019s body into an extensive seat of sound. He thinks that the sounds proceeding from the mouth...\nmouth of a ventriloquist are uttered in such a direction that the hearers may receive the impression of some echo with much more force than they can receive the original sound*. It may be doubted whether such echoes can take place in an ordinary room filled with a large assembly; and on the whole we are inclined to consider this phenomenon as being effected partly by the gradual emulsion and a skilful management of a large quantity of air taken in by a full inspiration, and partly by the influence which the performer is capable of exerting over the imagination of his hearers.\n\nSeveral of the mammalia have a characteristic voice, which is formed by particular organs. These are in some animals tense membranes; in others peculiar cavities opening into the larynx, and sometimes appearing like continuations of the laryngeal ventricles. Thus the neighing of the horse is effected by a delicate and nearly falciform membrane, which is attached by its middle to the thyroid cartilage, and has its extremities running along the outer margins of the opening of the glottis. The braying of the ass is produced by means of a similar membrane, under which there is an excavation in the thyroid cartilage. In this animal there are also two large membranous sacs opening into the larynx. The purring of the cat seems to be owing to two delicate membranes that lie below the ligaments of the glottis. Some of the monkey tribe, especially the *femina feniculus* and beelzebul, have the middle and fore part of the os hyoides formed into a spherical bony cavity, by which these animals are enabled to produce those horrible and penetrating tones, which can be heard at vast distances, and have gained them the name of howling apes\u2020. See Mammalia, No\u00b0 33.\n\nThe simplest vocal organ seems to be that of birds. These animals have, on the sides of the windpipe next the lungs, and at the opening of the bronchiole, two membranous folds which partly close the pulmonary aperture of the windpipe, and the aperture next the head is susceptible of great contraction and dilatation. In short, the vocal organ of birds may be considered as one of the most perfect wind instruments, very much resembling, both in its structure and effect, a clarinet or hautboy, the opening next the lungs being similar to the reed of these instruments. For some remarks on the song of birds, see Ornithology, No\u00b0 42; and for farther observations on the voice, see Anatomy, Part I., No\u00b0 122.\n\nIn tracing the relations of respiration with the preceding functions, we must deviate a little from our usual order, and begin with those between respiration and circulation, as it seems to be through the medium of the circulating system that respiration principally acts on the other functions. The relations between respiration and circulation are the most immediate and the most obvious. When the breathing is most free and rapid, the circulation is most vigorous and active; while in labored or interrupted respiration, the action of the heart and arteries becomes slow, feeble, irregular; and where the lungs are deprived of oxygenous gas, the arteries gradually cease to pulsate, and soon after the motion of the heart ceases. If the stimulus of oxygen be not too long withheld, so that the lungs can again be excited to action, first the heart, and then the arteries, gradually renew the exercise of their functions, and the circulation proceeds as before. On the application of these principles depends the recovery of those apparently dead from apoplexy (suffocation, drowning, &c.). When the circulation becomes languid from indolence, from depressing passions, or the want of accustomed stimuli, we feel about the breast a peculiar sensation, which physicians call anxiety, and which is relieved by a deep inspiration; by sighing, yawning, &c. Violent exertions of the respiratory organs, such as laughing, coughing, sneezing, talking unusually long or loudly, quicken the circulation, sometimes to an alarming degree, so as to occasion hemorrhage in such as are predisposed to that affection. Breathing in an atmosphere that is much rarified, as on the top of a high mountain, has often the effect of producing plethora and hemorrhage; though this, perhaps, is imputable rather to a want of the ordinary pressure on the surface of the body.\n\nWhen the circulation through the lungs is impeded or obstructed, a determination of blood takes place to other parts, especially to the head. The effects produced on the brain and other organs of sensation, by the breathing of impure air, are dreadful. When the same quantity of air is repeatedly respired, there is experienced, first, great anxiety about the breast, and this soon becomes intolerable; the face swells, becomes livid, or even black, and feels excessively hot; sparks of fire seem to dance before the eyes; the sight becomes depraved; giddiness, ringing in the ears, and confusion of thought succeed; and if fresh air be not soon supplied, the subject of the experiment loses both sensation and motion, and falls into a state resembling apoplexy\u2021. When rarefied air is breathed, the nervous system experiences a kind of excitement; agreeable sensations are Death, produced, with a disposition to mirth and cheerfulness; but if the person continue for some time in such a situation, an unusual languor, heaviness, and disposition to sleep, come on\u2020. We need not here describe the pleasurable sensations excited by the respiration of nitrous oxide, as these have been already related under Chemistry, No\u00b0 366. The exhilarating effects which pure and serene atmosphere produce on the general system, and the uneasy sensations experienced under a thick and clouded sky, are partly referable to this head. The nervous system also acts on the organs of respiration. In some affections of the brain, respiration is much quickened, while in others, especially the coma-like affections, it is slow, laborious, and often attended with that peculiar noise called stertor. It is well known what effect anxiety, eagerness, hope, or desire, have on the respiration. According as one or other of these passions is predominant, the breathing becomes hurried, irregular, or suspended.\n\nAn evident relation takes place between respiration and motion. The breathing is quickened by exercise; and when there is a considerable debility of the muscular system, the slightest exertion produces hurried respiration, panting, &c. In those animals that possess the greatest powers of motion, respiration is most free, and the air most extensively diffused over the body. In birds, not only the lungs are very extensive, but the air is conveyed into the bones of the skull, and into the hollows of the larger cylindrical bones; and in insects which have the most rapid motions, the air penetrates to every part of the body. Motion, as well as sensation, becomes unusually free and vigorous in rarefied air, and during the respiration of nitrous oxide; while in cafes...\nof impeded or obstructed respiration, the action of the muscles is languid and feeble. Indeed, if we may implicitly rely on the experiments that have been made on the respiration of de-oxygenated gases, the muscular fibres are among the first organs that are injured. We are told that by the admission of black blood, or blood that has not undergone the necessary changes by healthy respiration, the muscles lose their power of contraction, and even their irritability.\n\nThe organs and function of respiration sympathise with those of digestion. When the former function is most free, the latter is generally most healthy; the respiration of pure or rarefied air, or of the nitrous oxide, is attended with an increase of appetite, and of the digestive powers, as was experienced by M. Sauflaire while wandering among the Alps, and by Davy while respiring the gas of Paradis. Again, when digestion is impaired, or when the stomach is overloaded, the breathing is rendered difficult, laborious, or irregular, and in many cases of affection of the stomach, cough is a very common symptom. These effects produced on the respiratory organs in consequence of impaired digestion, are ascertainable chiefly to the pressure on the diaphragm by the distended stomach.\n\nMany other relations might be pointed out between respiration and the other functions of the animal economy, but our limits do not permit us to enlarge further on the subject.\n\nFor an account of the morbid affections of respiration, such as sneezing, hiccup, coughing, anxiety, dyspnea, or difficulty of breathing, see the article MEDICINE.\n\n**CHAP. IX. Of Nutrition and Assimilation.**\n\nThe function by which the nutritious particles received by a living being are assimilated to the nature of that being, or become part of its substance, is properly called nutrition. This is the completion of the process which, in most animals, is the combined result of several other operations. Thus, in the superior animals, from man to the mollusca, the whole process of nutrition consists of digestion, absorption, circulation, and respiration; by the last of which the nourishment received is changed into perfect blood, and fitted for the support and renewal of the several parts of the system. From the account of the constituent parts of the blood given under CHEMISTRY, No 2660, it will appear, that this fluid contains within itself the principles of which every part of the body is composed. Thus it contains fibrine, which is the chief principle of the muscular parts; phosphate of lime, which forms the basis of the bones; albumen and gelatine, the chief constituents of cartilages, ligaments and tendons, &c. These principles are conveyed by the arterial blood, during its circulation, to those parts of the system where they are required, for renewing waste, or supplying deficiencies, and thus they are assimilated to the nature of the body.\n\nThe power of assimilation, so remarkable in living bodies, is not the same in every assimilating organ; but each has the property of converting the materials it receives (provided they be susceptible of this conversion) into a peculiar substance. Thus, the stomach always converts the food into chyme; the intestines change it into chyle; but if chyle, or what is very similar to it, fresh milk, be received into the stomach, this organ exerts on it the usual change, and does not pass it forward into the intestines unaltered, though we know by experiment, that fresh milk is capable of being taken up unchanged by the absorbents of the bowels.\n\nAgain, blood is always perfected within the circulating vessels; and if chyle or fresh milk be injected into the arteries, it produces dangerous effects, while the fresh blood of another living animal may be transfused into these vessels without injury. In like manner, if a piece of fresh muscular flesh be cut from a living animal, and applied to the muscles of another living animal, also newly divided, the two parts unite, and are immediately assimilated; and even fresh bone may, in the same manner be ingrafted on the living bones of the same, or of a different species of animal; while substances that are foreign to the nature of the animal body, when introduced into the blood-vessels, prove fatal, and when inserted into a wounded muscular or bony part, prevent the wound from healing.\n\nThese circumstances show that assimilation is a chemical process, though modified and regulated by the action of the living principle. The chemical nature of the process of assimilation is most distinctly proved by the well-known experiment of colouring the bones of an animal, by feeding it on madder. The particles of the madder, which we know to have a strong affinity for phosphate of lime, are carried unchanged from the stomach into the blood-vessels, and are thence conveyed, probably in combination with the phosphate of lime there contained, into the substance of the bones, where they are deposited, and remain for a considerable time.\n\nWe have considered nutrition as performed by the circulating vessels. It has been supposed that the nerves are the organs of nutrition; but this strange hypothesis is completely overturned by an experiment of the second Monro, which proves that the limb of a frog may be preserved alive and nourished by the blood-vessels, after its communication with the brain has been cut off by dividing the nerves.\n\nIn insects and zoophytes, where there are no circulating vessels, nutrition must be a very simple operation, according to Cuvier, it is performed by imbibition; the zoophytes of the animal's body receiving immediately the nutritious fluids on which it feeds.\n\nIn plants and animals, the assimilating power has allways certain limits precribed to it; its influence is very generally confined to the sort of food congenial to the species, and its strength is varied according to circumstances, as the age, the habits, and the state of health. Those which are young assimilate faster than those which are old; and one species, which may partly be owing to the nature of their food, will assimilate much faster than another. Certain worms that feed on animal and vegetable substances will, in twenty-four hours after their escape from the egg, become not only double their former size, but will weigh, according to Redi, from 155 to 210 times more than before. Most oils are of very difficult assimilation; and those which are volatile will often resist the long-continued and the varied action of the living organs; will mingle with the parts, and, undecomposed, communicate their flavour.\n\nOther circumstances respecting nutrition have been noticed.\nChap. X. Of Secretion.\n\nThat function by which any organ, or set of organs, separates from the general mass of blood certain principles intended to perform some important office in the animal economy, is called secretion; and the substances so separated, are called secretions.\n\nThe secretory organs in the more perfect animals are very numerous, and some of them very complex. The most simple of them seem to be the cellular texture, and the mucous membranes. The next in simplicity are the conglomerate glands, and perhaps the spleen, while the more complex organs are the liver, the testicles, the atrabiliary capsules, &c. An account of all these organs, as they occur in the human body, has been given in the first part of the article Anatomy; and the corresponding organs of the inferior animals, with others not found in man, are described by writers on comparative anatomy, especially Cuvier and Blumenbach.\n\nSecretion appears to be of three kinds: 1. Transudation, in which the secreted matters merely ooze through the pores of the secreting organ. This takes place in the lowest classes of animals, as in zoophytes, insects, and some worms, but rarely in the human subject. 2. Exhalation, in which the secreted fluids are poured out into cavities by certain branches of the arteries with open mouths, called exhalants. This appears to take place in many organs of the most perfect animals, especially from the mucous membranes, the synovial glands, &c. 3. Secretion, properly so called, in which the blood passes through glandular bodies, where a part of it is decomposed, and carried out in another form by particular tubes called excretory ducts. This is the case with most of the secreting organs, as the salivary glands, the lacrymal glands, the liver, the pancreas, the testicles, and a few others.\n\nThe secreted fluids are chiefly the following: lymph, serum, tears, mucus, saliva, pancreatic juice, gastric juice, enteric juice, bile, semen, synovia, fat, marrow, cerumen or ear-wax, and in the female, milk. The other matters secreted, which may rather be termed solid than fluid, are albumen, gelatine, fibrine, and phosphate of lime. On the nature and properties of all these substances, see the article Chemistry, Chap. xix. sect. 3.\n\nWith respect to the secretions in general, we may remark, that they are considerably influenced by age, sex, various affections of the mind, and various bodily diseases. They are formed by organs which are sometimes capable of supplying the deficiencies of each other; they are subjected to the influence of the atmosphere, and to the temperaments of the body; they are sometimes mixed together, and by this combination their nature is changed.\n\nWe shall now briefly examine the action of three of the secreting organs, viz. the cellular membrane, the liver, and the spleen.\n\nFrom the extensive distribution of the cellular membrane it is reasonable to conclude, that it is intended to perform several important offices in the animal economy. One of its most obvious uses is to form a general connecting medium between every part of the structure, while it at the same time separates and distinguishes every organ. From its elasticity, and the lubricating fluid which it holds within its cells, it facilitates motion, and thus assists the action of all the muscular parts and organs. That it is susceptible of great dilatation is proved by the phenomena of anasarca or dropsy; and the gradual evacuation of the water when anasarca limbs are punctured, as well as the passage of extraneous bodies below the skin from one part to another, seem to show that it possesses considerable contractile powers. It is chiefly, however, as a secreting organ that we are here to consider the cellular membrane; and in this way its function is of the utmost importance. The fatty matter, that is so copious in most of the superior animals, is contained within particular cells or bags of the cellular membrane, and is found in greatest quantities below the skin, especially on the sternum part of the belly, and about the kidneys. In some animals, as the hog, the seal, the walrus and the cetaceous tribes, it forms a layer several inches in thickness, and in all the water animals above mentioned it is nearly fluid. To these animals it not only serves the purpose of a warm covering by the flowness with which it conducts heat; but, by diminishing their specific gravity, renders their motions on the surface of the water much more easy and expeditious. One of the most important uses of the fat seems to be to supply nourishment to the body, when the ordinary channel is obstructed, or the system rendered incapable, from torpor or disease, of receiving food. When fat persons are attacked by fever, or similar acute diseases, they become emaciated, sometimes to so great a degree as to appear a mere skeleton; and those animals who sleep during winter, though very fat when they retire to their dormitories, are extremely lank and lean when they quit these on the return of spring. In all these cases the fat alone is absorbed, and supplies the waste that takes place in the body, and would otherwise prove fatal.\n\nOn the actions of the cellular membrane, see Bichat, Anatomie Generale, tom. i.\n\nSome physiologists have supposed that the bile secreted by the liver is not formed entirely from the blood of the liver, but partly from the hepatic artery. Dr Saunders, who has examined the arguments in favour of this supposition, decides against it, and considers the usual opinion of the bile being solely secreted from the blood of the vena portarum, as quite satisfactory. It has also been supposed, that the whole of the bile is not secreted by the liver, but that the gall bladder has a share in this office, and is not merely a reservoir, like the urinary bladder. This supposition is highly improbable, although we think there can be little doubt that the bile undergoes, within the gall bladder, some peculiar changes, which render it better fitted for the functions it has to perform. We know that the gall bladder is very muscular, and that there is an appearance of follicles within it. It is therefore probable that some matter is secreted from its internal surface, which produces a necessary change in the bile.\n\nThe principal use of the bile seems to be to stimulate the intestines, and thus keep up their energy and peristaltic motion, though it is probable that, besides this office, it performs several others of importance in the animal economy, such as assisting in the decomposition of the food, and thus forming chyle; and acting as a general...\ngeneral stimulus to the system. That it has this last effect is probable from the torpor, inactivity, and dejection that attend hypochondriacal and chlorotic affections, in which this secretion is defective. Too great a secretion, or rather excretion of bile, is attended with violent purging.\n\nOn the nature of the bile, and biliary concretions, see Chemistry, No. 2664.\n\nFew subjects in physiology have given rise to more discussion, and few have been considered with so little success, as the use of the spleen in the animal economy. That an organ so large, and so well supplied with blood, should be intended for some important function, is scarcely to be doubted; and yet the instances of animals that have lived, seemingly with little inconvenience, after the spleen had been cut out, seem to prove that this organ is not of such great importance as it appears to be. The conjectures respecting its uses are various, and some of them not a little ludicrous. Some have supposed that it acted by its weight and pressure on the stomach, and thus promoted digestion at one time, and counteracted hunger at another; some, that it was intended to dilute and attenuate the blood; others, to deprive that fluid of its superabundant oil; another party, that it contributed to form the red globules of the blood; and some of the older physiologists supposed that it secreted that fluid to which they gave the name of black bile. Dumas is of opinion that it is a sort of supplementary organ, both to the liver and the kidneys, separating from the blood part of its ferocity, and then delivering it over to the liver in a proper state for the formation of bile; and furnishing to the kidneys another portion of ferocity to form the watery part of the urine. That at least a part of these opinions of Dumas has some foundation, will appear from the following summary of the late experiments of Mr Everard Home.\n\nProceeding the inquiry respecting the state of the stomach during digestion, which we have formerly alluded to (see No. 161), Mr Home found that during digestion, the fluids taken into the stomach are principally contained in the cardiac portion; and he inferred, from the uniform confluence of the chyme in the pyloric portion, that a great part of the fluids are carried out of the stomach without ever reaching the pylorus. As he conceived very naturally, that the lymphatics of the stomach were inadequate to this office, he conjectured that the fluids might pass off by the spleen. He proved, by a decisive experiment, that liquids might pass through the stomach without going through the pylorus, and he also found at the same time, that the spleen was turgid, unusually large, and its external surface very irregular; and when cut into, small cells were everywhere met with, containing a watery fluid, and occupying a considerable portion of its substance. Rudiments of these cells had been seen before by Malpighi, who considered them to be glands, and by Cuvier, who calls them corpuscles; but the cells in a distended state seem not to have been examined till Mr Home was led to look for them, in consequence of the above experiment. Mr Home varied this experiment, by giving animals a decoction of madder, and an infusion of rhubarb, and obtained similar results. Part of the fluid swallowed was again rejected by vomiting; but of that which remained it was always found that a part had escaped, without any possibility of passing by the pylorus, as this was secured by ligature. It did not probably escape by the absorbents, as these were not so much distended by fluid as to be visible; and it certainly did enter the spleen, as there was there found a quantity of liquor, which was proved, by an alkaline test, to contain rhubarb. A large quantity of urine was found in the bladder, also impregnated with rhubarb.\n\nFrom these experiments it appears, that the spleen is capable of carrying off from the stomach, a part of its fluid contents, thus affording a much nearer passage to the bladder than through the absorbents. If this investigation, on further trials, shall prove equally satisfactory, it will explain why the bladder is often distended with urine in a short time after drinking; and will do away the necessity of having recourse to the disputed hypothesis of the retrograde action of the absorbents.\n\nIn the inferior classes of animals there are a number peculiar of peculiar secretions, which, from their utility in medical practice or the arts, or from their noxious or unpleasant effects, are deserving the attention of physiologists. We can here only mention a few of the more important. The nature and properties of most of them are explained under Chemistry.\n\nSome of the mammalia secrete matters that have a very strong smell, as musk, civet, civet, and in particular the fluid emitted from the hide of several of the weasel tribe, beside the civet cat. Ambergris is secreted by some species of whales. Birds, especially water fowls, secrete a large quantity of oily matter, which they use in dressing their feathers. Some reptiles, especially the toad, secrete an acrimonious fluid, which seems to serve them as a weapon of defense. Many serpents, as is well known, produce a most virulent poison, which they inject into the wounds inflicted by their fangs. Some fishes secrete fluids of a similar tendency. Few animals, however, form secretions so various and so useful, as the insect tribes, from whom we procure cochineal, kermes, lac, silk, &c. Some of the mollusca, as the mulete, and the spinning flug, also secrete a matter similar to silk, by means of which they either secure themselves firmly in their situations, or facilitate their progressive motion. The ink of the cuttle fish, supposed with no small probability, to be the basis of Indian or Chinese ink, is also a remarkable animal secretion, which seems intended by nature to secure the animal, and assist it in eluding the vigilance of its pursuers.\n\nThere are also many important vegetable secretions, constituting what are called gums, resins, and gum-resins; secretions as gum-arabic, gum-dragon; guaiac, dragon's blood; affafetida, gamboge, myrrh, aloes, and many others; for an account of which see Chemistry and Materia Medica.\n\nChap. XI. Of Excretion.\n\nThe function of excretion differs but little in its nature from that of secretion already considered. As the organs of secretion separate from the blood those substances which are useful in the animal economy, so the excretory organs separate from the blood, or from the food taken into the stomach, those substances which are to be conveyed out of the body as excrementitious, viz. the solid excrement, the urine, and perspiration.\n\nThe organs of excretion, then, are chiefly the bowels, especially the larger intestines, the kidneys, with their appendages,\nThe physiology of intestinal excretion requires little exercise by the intestine. The remains of the food, after the nutritious chyle has been extracted from it by the lacteals, are carried onward through the colon and rectum by the peristaltic motion of the intestinal canal, excited to action by the stimulus of their contents, and of the bile, and assisted by the pressure of the abdominal muscles, till they reach the extremity of the rectum, when becoming more stimulant, partly by their bulk, and partly by their increased acrimony, they rouse the muscular fibres of that intestine to greater action, so as, with the assistance of the abdominal muscles, to overcome the resistance of the sphincter, and are thus expelled.\n\nIntestinal excretion is influenced by most of the preceding functions. 1. By the nervous power; as we find that in cases of paralysis, the excrements are not passed without artificial means, or they are voided involuntarily. 2. By motion. Thus we find that the action of the bowels is increased by exercise, and lessened by indolence and a sedentary life; though the quantity of excrement passed is greater in the latter case than in the former, shewing that the stimulus of the excrementitious matter is not sufficient without muscular action, to produce the regular performance of this function. 3. By digestion. It is well known that the stronger the digestive powers of the stomach, the more active are the bowels, and again, when these latter are overloaded with excrement, the functions of the stomach are disordered. 4. By secretion. The action of the intestines is increased, when that of the secretory organs which pour their contents into the alimentary canal, becomes unusually great, viz. in unusual secretions of bile or mucus, as in cholera and diarrhoea; while, when these secretions are defective, as in cases of jaundice, the intestines become unusually torpid.\n\nThe morbid affections of intestinal secretion have been considered under MEDICINE, No. 109-112, and 114, 115.\n\nThe organs destined for the excretion of urine afford the most complete apparatus for this function of any that we shall have occasion to notice, consisting of an assemblage of glands, collected within one membrane; an excretory duct; a reservoir for collecting the excreted fluid, and a canal for conveying it out of the body. Indeed we may consider the kidneys rather as secreting than excreting organs, as the urine there formed differs so much in its nature and properties from the circulating fluids. We know, by a decisive experiment, that the kidneys perform the whole of this office, and that the other organs are intended for the excretion of the urine; for when the ureters are tied or obstructed next the bladder, we find that the secretion of urine still goes on, and that the ureters above the obstruction soon become filled and prodigiously distended.\n\nThe nature and properties of urine, in its natural state, and as altered in certain diseases, have been considered under CHEMISTRY, No. 2670.\n\nAs the urine contains two substances that are not found in the blood, viz. urea and uric acid, Dr Thomson concludes, on very probable grounds, that the office of the kidneys is not merely to separate from the blood, a quantity of water and salts, but that they exert on this fluid some peculiar action, decomposing some part of the blood, and forming some new substance or substances.\n\nDuring certain affections of the nervous system, there is a relations, sudden and copious excretion of limpid urine, and some mental emotions produce an involuntary flow of it. And in cases of palsy, an incontinence, or a total suppression of the secretion of urine, is very common. This excretion is considerably influenced by motion, being less copious in those who use much exercise, or lead a laborious life.\n\nThe morbid affections referable to this excretion, are noticed under MEDICINE, No. 118-122.\n\nThe excretion by the skin, or perspiration, has exercised the ingenuity of many physicians and physiologists, by the skin ever since the time of Sanguinarius; and though it is not now considered as essential to life and health as it was in the beginning of the 18th century, it is certainly of great importance. The quantity of watery fluid occasionally thrown out by the skin in the form of sweat, proves that, by means of this organ, the blood is freed from a great deal of useless or perhaps injurious matter, which could not so conveniently, or so perfectly, be expelled by other outlets. The nature of the matter perspired, and the quantity of ordinary perspiration, have been investigated by many able experimentalists, the result of whose labours is given in the first volume of Johnson's Animal Chemistry; the fifth volume (third edition) of Dr Thomson's System of Chemistry; in a paper by Dr Kellie in the second number of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, and in our article CHEMISTRY.\n\nThe principal facts that have been ascertained with respect to the perspirable matter thrown out by the skin, relate either to its quantity, or its chemical composition.\n\nI. The experiments on the quantity perspired, on Quantity of which we can the most rely, are those of Lavoisier, Seigneurin, and Mr Abernethy. From these experiments we may deduce the following conclusions: 1. The greatest quantity of matter perspired in a minute, amounts to about 26 grains troy, the least to about 9 grains; giving an average of about 17 grains in the minute, or about 52 ounces in 24 hours. Dr Kellie estimates the quantity at about 30 ounces, which seems too small. 2. The quantity of perspiration is increased by drink, but not perceptibly by solid food. 3. Perspiration is the least in quantity immediately after a meal, and reaches its highest proportion during digestion.\n\nII. The perspirable matter is chiefly composed of a large quantity of water, some carbon or carbolic acid, a small quantity of another acid, supposed to be the phosphoric, and a peculiar oily matter of an odorous quality, differing in different animals, and, as it should seem, in different individuals. The perspiration of quadrupeds is frequently found to contain phosphate of lime, and sometimes urea. See CHEMISTRY, No. 2532.\n\nAs to the relations of perspiration with the preceding functions, we may remark that this excretion is increased by various passions of the mind, by exercise, by healthy and rapid digestion; that it is generally in proportion to the vigour and quickness of the circulation and respiration, and that it is capable of supplying the defect of the two former excretions. On the contrary,\nOf Integumentation it is lessened by inactivity; by the impaired state of the digestive organs; by languid circulation and respiration, and by violent purging, or evacuation of urine.\n\nChap. XII. Of Integumentation.\n\nAll living bodies are furnished with integuments, which are intended to afford them a defence against these injuries to which their situation is commonly exposed. Of the integuments some are useful in preventing the diffusion of the fluids; some in resisting acrid and corrosive substances; some of them are indigestible in the stomach of animals, and some appear to be incorruptible in the earth. By these properties, seeds and the ova of insects are preserved for a considerable time, awaiting the changes of soil or of season that are favourable to their evolution. They are protected from the action of weak membranous stomachs, and thus the animals who may swallow them contribute to their propagation. It is thus the seeds of the milletoe are dispersed, and deposited on the bark of the oak or the ash. There is a gelatinous substance frequently ejected by birds, and commonly called tremella, nessec, or star-fall, which Dr. Barclay has proved to be nothing else than the oviducts of frogs, which, as the embryo in form of an egg, moves along their winding canal, secrete that transparent and viscid matter which constitutes the albuminous part of the ovum, and feeds and protects the embryo while in water.\n\nThe most important circumstances with respect to integumentation relate to the varieties of the integuments themselves, and to the changes or renovation of these in different animals.\n\nI. Some integuments are useful, chiefly from their strength and hardness. The elytra or shell coverings of the beetle tribes afford an excellent defence for their membranous wings, when folded up; the shell of the snail lodges the intestines, when the animal comes forth to search for food, and affords a safe retreat to the animal, when it is threatened with any danger from without. The shells of some animals can be opened and closed by a muscular power; and some of them, as in the tail of the lobster, are disposed in plates or scales, as to be no hindrance to the animal's motion. Several insects which pass a part of their time in the water, always compose for themselves a shell, where it is needful.\n\nSome integuments are covered with feathers, some with hair or thick down. Besides many other obvious uses of these coverings, they generally serve to repel insects; and being bad conductors of heat, tend to preserve an equal and necessary temperature. Some integuments are covered with prickles, which oppose the attacks of an enemy by the strength of their points, or by the venom which they infuse, as in the stings of nettles, and the down of some other plants, and some insects. Others again are moistened by a viscid secretion, which preserves the necessary softness of the parts, prevents evaporation, resists acrimony, enables some beings to destroy their enemies, and assists others in performing their progressive motions.\n\nBoth plants and animals, but particularly the former, are often protected by odorous effluvia from their integuments. These effluvia are the finer parts of their volatile oil, always inflammable, and so subtile, that the continual emission of it from wood or flowers does not sensibly diminish their weight. To this fragrance it is owing, that the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), the henbane, hounds-tongue, and many others, are seen on almost every high road untouched by animals. The manchineel-tree of the West Indies emits so very dangerous vapours, that the natives poison their arrows with its juices, and those have died who have ventured to sleep under its shade. The lobelia longiflora of America produces a suffocating oppression in the breast of those who respire in its vicinity. The return of a periodical disorder has been attributed to the exhalation of the rhus toxicodendron. Of all the vegetable effluvia, however, that afford defence to the plant from which they proceed, or annoyance to the animals that approach it, none are equal to those of the celebrated bohun-upas, or poison-tree of Java, whose exhalations have been said to extend to the distance of several miles, preventing all access of animals, or punishing the intruders with certain death. It is rather unfortunate for the botanical poets, that the effects of this poison have been greatly exaggerated, if indeed such a marvellous tree really exists.\n\nVarious colours of the integuments afford a species of defence. Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green; and earthworms the colour of the earth which they inhabit. Butterflies which frequent flowers are coloured like them. Small birds which frequent hedges have greenish backs like the leaves, and light-coloured bellies like the sky, and are hence less visible to the hawk who passes under them or over them. Those birds which are much amongst flowers, as the goldfinch, are furnished with vivid colours. The lark, partridge, and hare, are of the colour of dry vegetables, or earth on which they rest; and frogs vary their colour with the mud of the streams which they frequent, and those which live on trees are green. Fish which are generally suspended in the water, and swallows which are generally suspended in the air, have their backs the colour of the distant ground, and their bellies of the sky. The Sphinx convolvuli, or unicorn moth, resembles in colour the flower on which it rests; and among plants, the nectary and petals of the ephryse, and of some kinds of the delphinium, resemble both in form and colour the insects which plunder them, and thus sometimes escape from their enemies by having the appearance of being pre-occupied. From colour being thus employed as a defence, many animals vary their colours with the seasons and circumstances; and those which are of different colours in summer according to the places which they inhabit, in winter assume in common the colour of the snow.\n\nII. The changes that take place on the integuments consist either of a partial, or complete, renewal of them. As the more superficial integuments are commonly insensible to stimuli, and perform little or nothing of the vital principle; in all cases where they cannot be enlarged to admit of an additional increase of growth, or, where they are not furnished with organs for repairing those injuries which they may suffer from accident or disease, the body is endowed by nature with a power of throwing them off, and of producing others in their stead. Thus, serpents and toads slough their skins; the crustacea cast their shells; the larvae of insects change their cuticle; and several trees, especially the\nChap. XIII. Of Transformation.\n\nThe alterations which organized beings undergo from metamorphosis or transformation, are more striking than those which we have described in the preceding chapter. It has indeed been asserted, that these alterations consist in throwing off certain temporary coverings; but this expression is inaccurate, and arises from a want of precision of ideas. Transformation and change of integuments are really different; the truth is, transformation often takes place without any change of integuments, and there is often a change of integuments without any change of form. This new form is sometimes occasioned by a change of shape, consistency, and colour, as when the lobes of a leaf are converted into lamellae leaves. It is at other times occasioned by a change of proportion among the parts, and at others by the addition of new organs, as when the emmet receives wings, and the plume of the leaf is fed by new roots striking into the ground: or, lastly, it is occasioned by a change in the form and organs, and in their mode of operation, as happens in a remarkable degree to some insects. Indeed, though all living bodies, both plants and animals, undergo some degree of transformation in the course of their existence, these changes are most remarkable in insects.\n\nMany reptiles undergo very curious changes, but these are most remarkable in the frog tribe. The larva or tadpole, as it is called, of the frog, is an animal with a large head, a long tail, no limbs, and commonly possessed of gills, all obviously very different, both in form, proportion, and uses, from the parts of the perfect animal. The curious appearance of what has been considered as the tadpole of the *Rana paradoxa*, has led some naturalists to describe it as an animal of a different genus, either a fish or a lizard; see *Herpetology*, p. 284.\n\nMany insects appear to consist of two distinct animal bodies, one within the other; the exterior, a creature of an ugly form, residing in the water, or under the earth, breathing by gills, or sometimes by tracheae projecting from the tail, possessing a voracious and growing appetite, and having a system of sanguiferous vessels that circulates the blood towards the head. When all its parts decay and fall off, the creature inclosed succeeds in its stead: this often is an animal of a different form, generally lives in a different element, feeds on a different species of food, has different instruments of motion, different organs of sense, different organs of respiration and differently situated; and being endowed with the parts of generation, inclines to gratify the sensual propensity, and produces an embryo, which becomes like the first, and from which, in process of time, a creature is evolved similar to the former.\n\nIf the embryo or egg be deposited on a leaf, the leaf is frequently observed to bend, to wrap it in folds, intended for the purpose of protecting it from injuries and danger. If deposited in the body of an animal or plant, they accommodate themselves to its wants and necessities, and furnish a tumor which serves it for a nidus, and besides, like an uterus, supplies it with nourishment; and if deposited in the body of an insect, the creature provides for the future destination of its young charge with all the tender care of a parent, and then dies.\n\nThese circumstances, added to the great variety of forms which insects assume, render it sometimes difficult to know who is the parent. We cannot, for instance, distinguish pronounces with certainty who is the true parent of the *gordius*, known by the name of the *seta equina*, or hair eel. A set of experiments which Dr. Barclay once began with a view to throw some light on the subject, were unfortunately interrupted by an accident. He learned only, from a number of observations, that certain black beetles, at the end of summer, have the strongest propensity to run into the water, where they soon die; and that one or two, and sometimes three or four of those cells gradually drop from the beetle by the anus. Whether other insects provide for the gordius in this manner, we have not yet been able to determine.\n\nIn all living bodies possessed of a *seniorium*, the changes of form, as well as the changes of habit and ofage, are usually accompanied with new propensities, appetites, and passions.\n\nMicroscopic observations having demonstrated, that the all the forms of the plant and animal existed previously in the seed or embryo; transformation must be owing entirely to the evolution of the different parts by means of nutrition.\n\nWhat nature intends by transformation, we cannot determine; but by means of it different elements are peopled, the different seafans variously adorned, and animated nature wonderfully diversified without a multiplication of beings.\n\nChap. XIV. Of Reproduction.\n\nIn the present chapter we shall notice, first, the partial reproductions that take place in some classes of animals, and then take a general comparative view of the principal phenomena of generation, in the various classes of living beings.\n\nExperiments have proved, that even in the superior classes of animals, many parts of the body, when destroyed or removed, may be reproduced. A bone may be broken in such a manner, that part of it must be taken away, but in a few weeks the separated ends are brought together by the secretion of new bony matter, called *callus*. Little more than 24 hours have elapsed after a fracture, before nature begins her operations. The soft parts inflame; the periosteum becomes swollen; the vessels pour out coagulable lymph, and a pellucid, gelatinous substance appears about the broken extremities of the bone. Into this minute blood-vessels are gradually sent off from the arteries, and in no very long time phosphate of lime begins to be secreted, for rendering the whole firm and compact. In cases of necrosis, where the old bone entirely loses its vitality, new bony matter is secreted into the surrounding periosteum, which thickens and enlarges, and in time supplies the place of the old bone. When a muscular part is cut away, as in removing flesh, that\nthat has become gangrenous, if the healthy function of the surrounding parts can be restored, and the loss of flesh has not been too great, the wound gradually fills up, not indeed with fibrous fibres, but with granulations very much resembling the ordinary cellular substance. It is well known, that the hair, nails, and skin, are occasionally renewed; but it will appear extraordinary that blood-vessels, and even nerves, have been reproduced. In cases of aneurism, where the trunk of the diseased artery is divided, so as to cut off the usual channel for the blood, the anastomosing branches become gradually enlarged, and even new branches appear to be formed for carrying on the circulation. What has been said above respecting the formation of callus, also proves the formation of new blood-vessels; and the observations of Mr John Hunter put this beyond a doubt. Till within these few years, it was thought impossible that a divided nerve should re-unite; but some late experiments of Mr Cruikshank have proved that this reunion may take place.\n\nUnder this head we may mention some curious experiments that have been lately made by Dr Jones, on the means by which nature suppresses the hemorrhage from divided arteries. These experiments were made on dogs, and the results of them lead us to conclude, that the following is nearly the process by which the hemorrhage is suppressed. First, the divided artery contracts, and is drawn within the neighbouring parts; blood is gradually effused into the sheath of the artery and the adjoining cellular substance, where it is entangled, and affords a basis for the formation of a coagulum or clot, which surrounds the extremity of the divided artery, and prevents the farther effusion of blood, till another clot is formed within the mouth of the artery, plugging it completely up. Soon after there oozes out between the external and internal clot, a quantity of coagulable lymph, which cements all the parts together, and thus in time, if the artery divided be not very large, and the force of the circulation very great, the cavity of the vessel and the divided extremity, is obliterated, and all further loss of blood effectually prevented.\n\nIt is, however, in the lower classes that we are to look for the most remarkable instances of this provision of nature, particularly among the reptiles, crustacea, mollusca, worms, and polypes.\n\nIn many reptiles, the legs and tail, when cut off, are soon renewed, and even the eyes have been re-produced. Some interesting experiments on this subject by Spallanzani have been related under Reproduction, p. 316, to which we refer the reader.\n\nIn the crustacea, the legs and claws are very often torn away, either by accident, or by some voracious animal; but they never fail to be renewed in a short time, provided the animal is in good health. This is most remarkable in the craw-fish (cancer astacus, Lin.). It has been observed that when the claw of this animal is broken, the most distant part is gradually cast off, and about a day or two after, a red membrane, not unlike a bit of red cloth closes up the aperture. This is at first plain; but in the course of four or five days it assumes a convexity, which gradually augments till it takes the appearance of a small cone, which exceeds not a line in height. It continues, however, to stretch out, and in ten days it is sometimes more than three lines, or about one-fourth of an inch high. It is not hollow, but filled with flesh, and this flesh is the basis or rudiment of a new claw. The membrane that covers the flesh performs the same office to the young claw as the membranes do to the fetus of the larger animals. It extends in proportion as the animal grows; and as it is pretty thick, we can perceive nothing but a lengthened cone. When 15 days are elapsed, this cone inclines towards the head of the animal. In a few days more its curvature increases, and it begins to assume the appearance of a dead claw. This claw, though at the end of a month or five weeks it has acquired the length of six or seven lines, which is more than half an inch, is still incapable of action. The membrane in which it is enclosed becoming gradually thinner, in proportion as it extends, gives an opportunity of observing the parts of the claw, and we now perceive that this conical substance is not a simple congeries of flesh. The moment is now arrived when the claw begins to be brought forth. The membrane at last bursts, and the new claw, though still soft, appears without incumbrance or investment. In a few days more it is covered with a shell; and though still delicate, and not the half of its former length, it is able to perform all the natural functions. It has likewise been discovered, that, whether the claw has been lopped off at the fourth articulation, or anywhere else, the animal in a short time recovers all that it had lost. The same reproduction takes place also in the horns; but, if the tail is cut off, the animal survives in a few days only.\n\nMany of the mollusca exhibit curious instances of reproduction, especially the actinia, the star-fish, and certain snails. The Abb\u00e9 Diquemaine made several experiments to ascertain the reproductive power of the actinia rufa (purple sea anemone). He first cut off all its tentacles, which grew again in less than a month; and on repeating this a second and third time, he had equal success. He cut off the upper part of one, and a few days after, the base of the animal was found to have fallen from its place; but it soon entirely recovered its limbs. But if the base of these animals is injured by the incision, the wound commonly proves mortal. The arms of the star-fish are often torn off, but appear always to be reproduced. The power of snails in this respect is very great; for Spallanzani has ascertained, that even if their heads are cut off, they are regenerated in no very long time. There can scarcely be a more surprising instance of animal reproduction than this, as we shall readily allow, if we consider the complicated structure of the head of a snail; that it contains a brain divided into two parts; that the horns attached to it are furnished with muscles, and that on the tops of the larger horns there are eyes, composed of two coats and three humours; that the head contains a mouth, lips, teeth, and a palate; and yet all these parts, when cut away, have been reproduced in the course of a few weeks.\n\nOn the reproductive power of polypes we have been sufficiently minute under Helminthology, No. 84.\n\nAs this subject of partial reproduction is extremely curious, and as we cannot here enter upon any particular detail on the experiments and observations that have been made on the subject, we shall conclude this part of the present chapter by enumerating the principal works to which the reader may refer for a more satisfactory account of the subject. These are chiefly Trembley,\nWe have already stated it as our opinion, that plants, as well as animals, reproduce their like by generation. We shall not now enter on a discussion of the controversial point of the sexual system; and as the parts that appear subservient to this function in plants, and their various modes of propagation, have been sufficiently explained under the articles Botany and Plant, we shall in this chapter confine our attention to the generation of animals.\n\nThe human organs of generation are described in the article Anatomy, sect. xv. those of the cetacea under Cetology, No. 161.; those of birds under Comparative Anatomy, 277: those of fishes have been noticed under Ichthyology. For a more full comparative view of these organs, we refer to Cuvier and Blumenbach.\n\nThe nature of generation which is the greatest mystery in the economy of living bodies, is still involved in impenetrable obscurity. The only circumstance common to all generation, and consequently the only essential part of the process, is, that every living body is attached at first to a larger body of the same species with itself. It constitutes a part of this larger body, and derives nourishment, for a certain time, from its juices. The subsequent separation constitutes birth, and may be the simple result of the life of the larger body, and of the consequent development of the smaller, without the addition of any occasional action.\n\nThus the essence of generation consists in the appearance of a small organized body in or upon some part of a larger one; from which it is separated at a certain period, in order to assume an independent existence.\n\nAll the processes and organs, which co-operate in the business of generation in certain classes, are only accessory to this primary function.\n\nWhen the function is thus reduced to the most simple state, it constitutes the gemmiparous, or generation by shoots. In this way the buds of trees are developed into branches, from which other trees may be formed. The polypes (hydra) see Helminthology, No. 84. and the sea anemones (actinia), multiply in this manner; some worms are propagated by a division of their body, and must, therefore, be arranged in the same division. This mode of generation requires no distinction of sex, no copulation, nor any particular organ.\n\nOther modes of generation are accomplished in appropriate organs; the germs appear in a definite situation in the body, and the affluence of certain operations is required for their further development. These operations constitute fecundation, and suppose the existence of sexual parts; which may either be separate, or united in the same individual.\n\nIn most animals the embryo of the future young is fecundated within the peculiar organs of one individual, while another of the same species is provided with the means of giving activity to the embryo by a fecundating fluid. In some animals, however, both these offices are performed by the same individual, which is then said to be androgynous, or hermaphrodite.\n\nThe office of the male sex is that of furnishing the distinction fecundating or seminal fluid; but the manner in which it does so contributes to the development of the germ is not yet settled by physiologists. In several instances, particularly in the frog, the germ may be clearly recognized in the ovum before fecundation; its pre-existence may be inferred in other cases from the manner in which it is connected to the ovum when it first becomes visible; for it is agreed on all hands, that the ovum exists in the female before fecundation, since virgin hens lay eggs, &c.\n\nThe combination of the sexes and the mode of fecundation are subject to great variety. In some instances, they are united in the same individual, and the animal impregnates itself. The acephalous mollusca and the echini exemplify this structure. In others, although the sexes are united in each individual, an act of copulation is required, in which they both fecundate, and are fecundated; this is the case with the gastropodous mollusca and several worms. In the remainder of the animal kingdom the sexes belong to different individuals.\n\nThe fecundating liquor is always applied upon or Moles of about the germs. In many cases the ova are extruded impregnated before they are touched by the semen, as in some bony fishes and the cephalopodous mollusca. Here, therefore, impregnation is effected out of the body, as it is also in the frog and toad. But in the latter instances the male embraces the female, and discharges his semen in proportion as she voids the eggs. In most animals the seminal liquor is introduced into the body of the female, and the ova are fecundated before they are discharged. This is the case in the mammalia, birds, most reptiles, and some fishes; in the hermaphrodite gastropodous mollusca, in the crustacea, and insects. In all the last mentioned orders ova may be discharged without previous copulation, as in the preceding. But they receive no further development; nor can they be fecundated when voided. We shall not gratify the prurient imagination of the philosophic sensualist, by any description of the mode in which these operations are carried on in the various classes of animals, except in one instance, which is so curious that we shall be excused for describing it. We allude to the copulation of the snail.\n\nThese animals meet in pairs, and stationing themselves an inch or two apart, launch several little darts, or nails, not quite half an inch long, at each other. These are of a horny substance, and sharply pointed at one end. The animals, during the breeding season, are provided with a little reservoir for them, situated within the neck, and opening on the right side. On the discharge of the first dart, the wounded snail immediately retaliates on its aggressor by ejecting at it a similar dart; the other again renews the battle, and in turn is again wounded. Thus are the darts of Cupid, metaphorical with all the rest of the creation, completely realized in snails. After the combat they come together. Each of them lays its eggs in some sheltered and moist situation.\ntion, generally under a little clod of earth, or in some cool cavity.\n\nThe effect of a single copulation varies in its degree; it usually fecundates one generation only; but sometimes, as in poultry, several eggs are fecundated; still, however, they only form one generation. In a very few instances one act of copulation fecundates several generations, which can propagate their species without the aid of the male. In the plant-louse (aphis) this has been repeated eight times; and in some monoculi 12 or 15 times.\n\nWhen the germ is detached from the ovary, its mode of existence may be more or less complete. In most animals it is connected, by means of vessels, to an organized mass, and the absorption of which nourishes and develops it until the period of its birth. It derives nothing, therefore, from the body of the mother, from which it is separated by coverings varying in number and solidity. The germ, together with its mass of nourishment, and the surrounding membranes, constitutes an egg, or ovum; and the animals which produce their young in this state, are denominated oviparous.\n\nIn most of these the germ contained in the egg is not developed until that part has quitted the body of the mother, or has been laid; whether it be necessary that it should be afterwards fecundated, as in many fishes; or require only the application of artificial heat for its incubation, as in birds; or that the natural heat of the climate is sufficient, as in reptiles, insects, &c. These are strictly oviparous animals.\n\nThe ovum, after being fecundated and detached from the ovarium, remains in some animals within the body of the mother, until the contained germ be developed and hatched. These are false viviparous animals, or ovo-viviparous. The viper, and some fishes, afford instances of this process. Mammalia alone are truly viviparous animals. Their germ possesses no provision of nourishment, but grows by what it derives from the juices of the mother. For this purpose it is attached to the internal surface of the uterus, and sometimes, by accident, to other parts, by a kind of root, or infinite ramification of vessels, called placenta. It is not, therefore, completely separated from the mother by its coverings. It does not come into the world until it can enjoy an independent organic existence. The mammalia cannot, therefore, be said to possess an ovum in the sense which we have assigned to that term.\n\nFrom this view of the subject, generation may be said to consist of four functions, differing in their importance, and in the number of animals to which they belong.\n\n1. The production of the germ, which is a constant circumstance;\n2. Fecundation, which belongs only to the sexual generation;\n3. Copulation, which is confined to those sexual generations, in which fecundation is accomplished within the body;\n4. Uterogestation, which belongs exclusively to viviparous generation.\n\nThere is a general rule observable among all quadrupeds, that those which are large and formidable produce but few at a time; while such as are mean and contemptible are extremely prolific. The lion, or tiger, have seldom above two cubs at a litter; while the cat, that is of a similar nature, is usually seen to have five or six. In this manner, the lower tribes become extremely family numerous; and, but for this surprising fecundity, from their natural weakness, they would quickly be exterminated. The breed of mice, for instance, would have long since been blotted from the earth, were the mouse as slow in production as the elephant. But it has been wisely provided, that such animals as can make but little resistance, should have at least a means of repairing the destruction which they must often suffer, by their quick reproduction; that they should increase even among enemies, and multiply under the hand of the destroyer. On the other hand, it has as wisely been ordered by Providence, that the larger kinds should produce but slowly; otherwise, as they require proportional supplies from nature, they would quickly consume their own store; and, of consequence, many of them would soon perish through want; so that life would thus be given without the necessary means of subsistence. In a word, Providence has most wisely balanced the strength of the great against the weakness of the little. Since it was necessary that some should be great and others mean, since it was expedient that some should live upon others, it has afforded the weakness of one by granting it fruitfulness, and diminished the number of the other by infecundity.\n\nIn consequence of this provision, the larger creatures, which bring forth few at a time, seldom begin to generate till they have nearly acquired their full growth. On the contrary, those which bring many reproduce before they have arrived at half their natural size. Thus the horse and the bull are at their best before they begin to breed: the hog and the rabbit scarce leave the teat before they become parents in turn. Almost all animals likewise continue the time of their pregnancy in proportion to their size.\n\nFor an account of the principal phenomena attending the reproduction of the human species, viz., the requisites for conception and its signs; the effects of impregnation; the gradual evolution of the fetus, and the successive changes that take place in the uterine system during uterogestation, see the article Midwifery, chap. i. and ii. The phenomena of reproduction in other viviparous animals are so analogous to those in the human species, that we need not enter on an examination of them. We shall here only give a view of the successive changes that take place in the egg of birds during incubation, taken from the observations of the celebrated Blumenbach.\n\nThe following observations refer to the egg of the common hen, as affording the most familiar example of incubation.\n\nA small shining spot, of an elongated form, with rounded extremities, but narrowest in the middle, is cubation perceived at the end of the first day, not in nor upon the\n\n---\n\n(1.)

The membrane lining the shell is called membrana albuminis, and includes the two whites of the egg, the inner of which surrounds the yolk, which is contained within a peculiar, very delicate membrane, called the yolk-bag. From two opposite sides of this bag proceeds a white knotty body, terminating in the white of the egg, by a flocculent extremity. These bodies are called the chalaza or grandines; the cicatricula, tread, or traddle, is surrounded by one or more whitish concentric circles called halones, or circuli, the use of which is not known.\nAbout this time the haloes enlarge their circles; but they soon after disappear entirely, as well as the cicatricula.\n\nThe first appearance of red blood is discerned on the surface of the yolk-bag, towards the end of the second day. A series of points is observed, which form grooves; and these closing constitute vellus, the trunks of which become connected to the chick. The vascular surface itself is called *figura venosa*, or *area vesiculosa*; and the vessel by which its margin is defined, *vena terminalis*. The trunk of all the veins joins the *vena porta*; while the arteries, which ramify on the yolk-bag, arise from the mesenteric artery of the chick.\n\nOn the commencement of the third day; the newly formed heart is discerned by means of its triple pulsation, and constitutes a threefold *punctum falcis*. Some parts of the incubated chicken are destined to undergo successive alterations in their form; and this holds good of the heart in particular. In its first formation it resembles a tortuous canal, and consists of three dilations lying close together, and arranged in a triangle. One of these, which is properly the right, is then the common auricle; the other is the only ventricle; but afterwards the left; and the third is the dilated part of the aorta.\n\nAbout the same time, the spine, which was originally extended in a straight line, becomes incurvated; and the distinction of the vertebrae is very plain. The eyes may be distinguished by their black pigment; and comparatively immense size; and they are afterwards remarkable in consequence of a peculiar slit in the lower part of the iris.\n\nFrom the fourth day, when the chicken has attained the length of four lines, and its most important abdominal viscera, as the stomach, intestines, and liver, are visible, (the gall-bladder, however, does not appear till the fifth day), a vascular membrane begins to form about the navel; and increases in the following days with such rapidity, that it covers nearly the whole inner surface of the shell, within the *membrana albuminis*, during the latter half of incubation. This seems to supply the place of the lungs, and to carry on the respiratory process instead of those organs. The lungs themselves begin indeed to be formed on the fifth day; but, as in the fetus of the mammalia, they must be quite incapable of performing their functions while the chick is contained in the amnion.\n\nVoluntary motion is first observed on the sixth day, when the chick is about seven lines in length.\n\nOssification commences on the ninth day, when the osific juice is first secreted, and hardened into bony points. These form the rudiments of the bony ring of the sclerotica, which resembles at that time a circular row of the most delicate pearls.\n\nAt the same period, the marks of the elegant yellow vessels on the yolk-bag, begin to be visible.\n\nOn the fourteenth day the feathers appear; and the animal is able to open its mouth for air, if taken out of the egg.\n\nOn the nineteenth day it is able to utter sounds; and on the twenty-first to break through its prison, and commence a new life.\n\nBlumenbach concludes his observations with a few remarks on those very singular membranes, the yolk-bags and the chorion, which are so essential to the life and preservation of the animal.\n\nThe chorion, that most simple yet most perfect temporary substitute for the lungs, if examined in the latter half of incubation in an egg very cautiously opened, on the chorion presents, without any artificial injection, one of the most splendid spectacles that occurs in the whole organic creation. It exhibits a surface covered with numberless ramifications of arterial and venous vessels. The latter are of a bright scarlet colour, as they are carrying oxygenated blood to the chick; the arteries, on the contrary, are of a deep or livid red; and bring the carbonated blood from the body of the animal. Their trunks are connected with the iliac vessels; and, on account of the thinness of their coats, they afford the best microscopic object for demonstrating the circulation in a warm-blooded animal.\n\nThe other membrane is also connected to the body of the chick; but by a two-fold union, and in a very different manner from the former. It is joined to the small intestine, by means of the *ductus vitello-intestinalis*, and also by the blood-vessels with the mesenteric artery and vena porta.\n\nIn the course of the incubation the yolk becomes constantly thinner and paler, by the admixture of the inner white. At the same time innumerable fringe-like vessels with flocculent extremities, of a most singular structure, form on the inner surface of the yolk-bag, opposite to the yellow ramified marks, and hang into the yolk. There can be no doubt that they have the office of absorbing the yolk, and conveying it into the veins of the yolk-bag, where it is assimilated to the blood, and applied to the nutrition of the chick. Thus in the chick which has just quitted the egg, there is only a remainder of the yolk and its bag to be discovered in the abdomen. These are completely removed in the following weeks, so that the only remaining trace is a kind of cicatrix on the surface of the intestine.\n\nMany of the causes which contribute to the formation of a living body have hitherto eluded human research; may in all probability never be discovered; and perhaps are beyond human comprehension.\n\nSome philologists, discovering the extreme divisibility of matter, and learning from the microscope that transformation is, but the development of certain parts that previously existed, have thence imagined that generation is somewhat analogous; that all organized bodies receive their form at the beginning; that the first of every genus and species contained by involution the numberless millions of succeeding generations; and that the union of the two sexes gives only a stimulus, and brings into view forms that had existed since the world began.\n\nBy this hypothesis they have attempted to explain a thing that is unknown by what truth remain for ever incomprehensible to the human mind in its present state. They absurdly appeal from observation to conjecture; and suppose that bodies which are originally brought into view, which are daily augmented, frequently repaired, and sometimes renewed by organic action, do nevertheless in their first formation require an effort superior to what omnipotence is able to perform by secondary agents. Had the supporters of this hypothesis considered that many herbaceous plants produce new flowers when...\nOf Reproduction. when the first fet are untimely cut off; that lobsters and many other animals renew their limbs, and that certain polyps can raise a structure so perfectly resembling a vegetable form as to puzzle the naturalist whether or not he should class them under plants, they would surely not have preferred such bounds to omnipotent wisdom and almighty power, or declared with such confidence what the Author of nature, to speak with the vulgar, must necessarily perform by his own hands, or what he may intrust to secondary causes regulated by his laws.\n\nThese philosophers will find it difficult to account in a very satisfactory manner for monstrous productions, and for those changes of structure and of form which for a while continue hereditary from the influence of habit. They object to others, that all the parts of a living body are mutually dependent on one another, and that they must necessarily have been coeval, or have existed at once. But though every attempt that has yet been made to ascertain which of the vital organs are prior and which posterior in a living body has proved unsuccessful, it has not been demonstrated that either themselves or their functions are coeval. It may, on the contrary, be plainly demonstrated from observation, that the lungs and the stomach do not begin to perform their functions so early as the heart and the vascular system; that even the heart and its system perform their functions with some considerable changes, immediately after birth; that the vegetable tribes are without nerves; and that the brain and nerves in the animal kingdom perform more and more of their functions, according as the system approaches towards maturity. It has even been shewn, that bones will unite; that the limbs of an animal continue to be nourished without the nerves; that there is a principle of life in the blood; that the heart will act under other stimuli beside that of nervous influence; and found logic does by no means require us to suppose, that the first action of the foetal heart, or the punctum saliens, is owing to the influence of stimuli from the brain, or that the brain must have existed when the heart first moved. Although the minuteness and transparency of the parts may prevent us from seeing the first gradual formation of the embryo, yet every observation corroborates the opinion, that it is formed by secondary causes, and through the medium of organic powers.\n\nMost physiologists have believed, the certain inorganic particles are contained in the system of one sex or the other, and that by the union of the sexes these particles have become organized. It has, however, been asked whether or not the embryo formed by the joint operation of the two sexes? or is it formed entirely by one, and brought into action by a stimulus from the other? The former of these questions supposes that each of the sexes has a seminal fluid; that some mixture takes place in the uterus, and produces an embryo, in the same manner that a neutral salt affumes a certain and determinate form. The notion implies some general and confused ideas of chemical combination; but does not bespeak a very clear understanding, profound reflection, or much acquaintance with the nature and properties of living bodies.\n\nFor a long time past the most rational physiologists have generally thought that the embryo is formed gradually and slowly in one or other of the two sexes, not by chemical combination, but a system of organs, directed by laws and prompted by stimuli, with many of which we are yet unacquainted. From the great Hippocrates to Fabricius and Harvey, the credit of furnishing the foetal embryo was almost universally given to the females of oviparous animals. Among the viviparous appearances were such, that the female was left to control it with the male. At last the eclat of Leeuwenhoek's discoveries seemed to put an end to all doubts entertained upon the subject. He very plainly saw through the microscope that very great profusion of particles that move to and fro with amazing rapidity in the male semen. Upon this he embraced the doctrine of H\u00e4mme, who had seen them before, and supposed from their motions that these particles were not only animalcules, but the principles or rudiments of that animal in whom they were formed, and that they were deposited in the uterus of the female only to be nourished and augmented in size.\n\nWhat raised objections against this theory was, that numerous animalcules were discoverable by the microscope in other fluids, and that a vast profusion of young embryos appeared in cases where never more than one or two arrive at maturity. It was an objection to it, that some females had been impregnated, where the hymen remained unbroken, so that the impregnating fluid could have reached only the mouth of the uterus. Again, in frogs, fishes, and many other animals, the ova are not impregnated till after extrusion; and lastly, Haller had observed the chick completely formed in eggs that had not been fecundated.\n\nIt is now, we believe, pretty generally known, that the embryo does not commence its existence in the cavity of the uterus. De Graaf observed it on its passage down the fallopian tube; he saw the place where it first began in the ovarium of the female, and cases have occurred where it has missed the fallopian tube, where it has fallen into the abdomen, in which the placenta has been formed, and the fetus has grown among the bowels.\n\nFrom these facts it has been concluded, notwithstanding some feeble objections, that the female ovaria contain the embryos in the form of eggs; that these eggs exist in the female semen, which is sometimes thrown into the cavity of the uterus, sometimes applied only to its mouth, and sometimes sprinkled on the eggs after they are extruded. For more on this subject see the article MIDWIFERY.\n\nA view of the relations between the present function Relations and those which we have before examined, is a subject of so delicate a nature, that we must not enlarge on it. The sympathy between the reproductive and the nervous systems is well known. The effect which desire has occasionally produced on the brain is very great, madness being not unfrequently the consequence, either of too much indulgence, or of total continence. We are of opinion that the influence of the fancy or imagination on the uterine system has been over-rated, though the accounts given of monsters or deformed births, in consequence of terror experienced by the mother, appear to be too well authenticated to warrant our total disbelief in this influence. Too much indulgence in this appetite produces a debilitated state, both of the","sp":104,"ep":123},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Chap. XV. Of Sleep and Torpor.\n\nWe have already considered the active means by which the waste of the body is repaired; but all these would have little effect, and could not indeed be carried on for any considerable time, without some general relaxation of the system. This relaxation is brought about by sleep, in which the active functions find a repose from the labours which they have undergone during the day; and in this way the system is recruited more completely than by any other means.\n\nSleep may be considered as an affection of mind, and therefore more properly a subject of metaphysical, than of physiological speculation. It is, however, generally treated of in systems of physiology; and it will be necessary to take notice of some circumstances respecting it. We shall chiefly consider the state of the body and mind during sleep, and some of the principal theories that have been contrived to account for it.\n\nNatural sleep returns at certain intervals, which are, however, different in different animals. Most animals, and especially man, sleep only during the night, but most of the predatory species, as beasts and birds of prey, choose this time for their predatory excursions, and repose during the day. Sleep comes on with an unusual languor and latitudine; an aversion to motion; the mind becomes unfit for its usual exertions; and the desire of rest pervades the whole system. In particular, the extensor muscles lose their power of preserving the body in an erect posture; the eyelids involuntarily fall; the head bows forward; the joints bend, and the body sinks. During sleep, all the voluntary motions are in general suspended; but the involuntary actions of the heart and lungs proceed, though not so vigorously as in the waking state; the circulation and respiration being slower than usual. Most of the senses are also in a state of repose, especially those of feeling, smell, and probably of taste. Hearing is, in some animals, very acute during sleep, and they are thus enabled to escape any danger that threatens them. Some animals, as the hare, also sleep with their eyes open; and in most the impression of light, when the eyelids are raised, is very evident. The functions of digestion, absorption, and secretion, seem to proceed with greater ease and activity during sleep; and assimilation and nutrition are much promoted by this state of repose. Some of the faculties of the mind, especially the imagination, are, however, in full vigour, as appears from the dreams that take place during sleep. The duration of sleep is exceedingly various. Among the human species, young children, and very old persons, pass the greatest half of their time in sleep, while middle-aged and active people seldom sleep so much as one third of the 24 hours.\n\nThough the returns of sleeping and waking depend much on custom, they may, however, be changed by various circumstances; and though the commencement of one of these periods happen to be altered, that of the other may remain as before. If a person is accustomed to go to sleep exactly at nine in the evening, and to rise again at six in the morning, though the time of sleep may be occasionally protracted till twelve, he will yet awaken at his usual hour of six; or if his sleep be continued by darkness, quietness, or similar causes, till the day be farther advanced, the desire of sleep will return in the evening at nine.\n\nMost of the causes that produce or prevent sleep, have been mentioned in the article MEDICINE, No. 94. Asleep to the immediate cause, the opinions of physiologists are much at variance, and the theory of sleep is as little understood as that of any function of the animal economy.\n\nAccording to Haller, sleep arises, either from a simple absence, deficiency and immobility of the spirits, or of Haller's from compression of the nerves, and always from the motion of the spirits through the brain being impeded. That sleep is, somehow or other, connected with a compression of the brain, appears very probable, from the heaviness and coma that take place in cases where such a compression has evidently been produced; but how this compression acts has never yet been satisfactorily explained; and the obstruction that Haller supposes in the motion of the animal spirits, or nervous fluid, is gratuitous.\n\nOne of the fashionable doctrines of the present day of Brown, respecting the immediate cause of sleep, is that this state is produced by an exhaustion of irritability or excitability. According to Brown, sleep succeeds a diminution of excitement, during which the excitability is either so far diminished that it can be accumulated again, or so abundant, that the excess can be waited, and in each case the excitement restored.\n\nSimilar to this is the doctrine of Zoonomia, that sleep depends on an exhaustion of senile power. Dr Darwin thus characterizes perfect sleep: 1. The power of volition is totally suspended. 2. The trains of ideas caused by sensation proceed with greater facility and vivacity; but become inconsistent with the usual order of nature. The muscular motions caused by sensation continue; as those concerned in our evacuations during infancy, and afterwards in digestion, and in priapismus. 3. The irritative muscular motions continue, as those concerned in the circulation, in secretion, and respiration. But the irritative senile motions, or ideas, are not excited; as the immediate organs of sense are not stimulated into action by external objects, which are excluded by the external organs of sense; which are not in sleep adapted to their reception by the power of volition, as in our waking hours. 4. The associate motions continue, but their first link is not excited into action by volition, or by external stimuli. In all respects, except those above mentioned, the three last senile powers are somewhat increased in energy during the suspension of volition, owing to the consequent accumulation of the spirit of animation.\n\nThus, the immediate cause of sleep consists in the suspension of volition produced by the exhaustion of senile power; and hence, whatever diminishes the general quantity of senile power, acts as a remote cause of sleep.\n\nBeside the insufficiency of these hypotheses to account for many circumstances that take place during sleep, we may remark, that this state is often produced when no exhaustion of irritability, excitability, or senile power, can be supposed to have taken place. Thus, the propensity to sleep often becomes irresistible from the effects of monotonous speaking, from stillness, darkness, or from...\nfrom the fames of the scenery around us; and when one stimulus, after long application, can arouse no more, another stimulus that in ordinary cases is less powerful, produces excitement, and keeps off sleep; an evident proof that excitability or sensorial power have not been very far exhausted.\n\nPlants have been said to sleep. At the approach of night, many of them are observed to change their appearances very considerably, and sometimes even to such a degree as scarcely to be known for what they are. These changes happen principally to the leaves and the flowers. During the night, many leaves, according to the nature and genus of the plant, are seen to rise up, to hang down, or to fold themselves in various ways, for the protection of the flowers, the buds, the fruits, the young stems; and many flowers, to escape a superabundance of moisture, to hang down their mouths towards the earth, or to wrap themselves up in their calices. These phenomena are owing to stimuli acting from without; we may add, that most of the motions are performed at the joints where the leaves and petals articulate with the stem. A period of rest is as necessary to plants as sleep is to animals. The irritable principle cannot act long under the influence of the same stimulus, except at intervals, and the rapid growth observable in plants during the night, is a strong proof that the organs employed in assimilation had been disturbed in discharging their functions during the day, when exposed to the action of heat and light and of other stimuli.\n\nIn our general outline, we had proposed introducing here an account of the phenomena of dreams, but we find that this subject has been so fully discussed under the article Dream, that any additional remarks would be unnecessary. To this article therefore we refer the reader.\n\nRules for the management of the body with respect to sleep, scarcely come within our present province; but as we pass so much of our time in this state, during which we are sometimes occupied in a very agreeable manner, while at others we are subject to most uneasy sensations, it is a matter of considerable consequence to take those measures which may secure to us the former, and enable us to avoid the latter. We have seen few rules better adapted to those purposes than those of Dr Franklin; but as more important matters press for attention within the circumscribed limits to which we are restricted, we must refer our readers to the original paper, which is published in the late 8vo edition of Franklin's Works, vol. iii. p. 437.\n\nIn a few cases, not only the imagination has a full range during sleep, but the voluntary motions of the body, and even the exercise of some of the external senses, are carried on with apparently as much perfection as when the person is awake. This state is called somnambulism, or sleep-walking, and is commonly considered as a variety of dreaming. Many surprising accounts have been given of sleep-walkers. They have been known to rise, dress themselves, go out of doors, and sometimes out of a window, from which they have climbed upon the roof of a house, dig in a garden, draw water from a well, saddle a horse and ride several miles; maintain a rational and interesting conversation, and even go through a laborious and difficult literary task; and after having performed these exploits, they have returned to their bed without being conscious of what they had been doing. This want of consciousness appears from their remembering nothing when awake, of what passed during their sleep. It is disputed whether somnambulists incur as much danger in the actions which they perform, as those who are awake, in similar circumstances. We are inclined to think that the danger is much less in the former case, as sleep-walkers seem entirely free from the terror which commonly attends the attempting of any hazardous enterprise when awake; such as mounting to the roof of a house, climbing a steeples, &c. If suddenly awakened, however, while engaged in any of their hazardous actions, the danger is very great.\n\nDr Darwin considers somnambulism, not as a state of reverie, sleep or dreaming, but as a variety of reverie, carried to a morbid extent, so as to become a sort of epileptic or cataleptic paroxysm. In the state of reverie, according to Dr Darwin, the irritative motions occasioned by internal stimuli continue, those from the stimuli of external objects are either not produced at all, or are never succeeded by sensation or attention, unless they are at the same time excited by volition; the sensitive motions continue, and are kept consistent by the power of volition; the voluntary and allocative motions continue undisturbed. He considers reverie as an effort of the mind to relieve some painful sensation, whence it is allied to convulsion and insanity*.\n\nThe torpor that takes place in many animals during winter, appears to be so nearly allied to sleep, that we shall consider it in this chapter.\n\nA great variety of animals of almost every class retire during the cold of winter, to the recesses of caverns, holes in old walls, hollow trees, or below the earth, where they remain in apparently a lifeless state till the return of spring rouzes them from their trance. We shall here enumerate the different animals that have been known to undergo this state of hibernation.\n\nBats, especially the vesperilio murinus, auritus, and v. noctula (see Mammalia, No 39); bears, especially ing the brown and the polar bear, and the badger; the hedgehog, (cerinaceus Europaeus); several species of the mouse and rat tribe, but more especially the hamster (mus cristatus), the marmot, especially the arctomys marmota, (see Mammalia, No 124); the dormouse (myoxus mycoides). Sheep appear capable of living for a considerable time in a torpid state, as they have been known to remain alive for several weeks, buried under the snow.\n\nIt does not appear that birds in general are capable of undergoing this state of existence; but the instances of of birds; swallows that have been found in this state in old walls and hollow trees, and even, as some affirm, below water, and have recovered life and activity on being exposed to gradual warmth, are too well authenticated to admit a doubt, that these at least sometimes hibernate.\n\nMost reptiles and serpents pass the winter in a state of of reptiles hibernation; but this is more particularly the case with and fer- the land tortoise (testudo graeca), see Herpetology, p. 271; frogs, and those lizards which inhabit cold cli- mates.\n\nIt is not certainly known whether many species of fish of fishes; become torpid in winter; but there is no doubt that se- veral of them are susceptible of this state*; and we are de Antima- told that in North America, especially about Hudfon's Silus Hic- bays, myopis*.\nOf Sleep bay, fishes are not unfrequently found included within a body of ice, and when exposed to gentle heat, have recovered life and motion.\n\nAlmost all insects remain, during the winter, in a torpid state. This happens principally to the chrysalites, and such grubs as cannot, in that season, procure their food.\n\nIt will appear extraordinary that we should place man among the hibernating animals; and yet there seems little doubt, that even he is capable of having his life suspended for a considerable time, when exposed to those causes which bring about the torpidity of those animals that we have already mentioned. We are told of a woman who, in February 1789, remained eight days buried in the snow, and still recovered; and the case of the three women who remained for 37 days in a stable at Bergamoletto, that had been overwhelmed by an avalanche, or snow heap, with no other sustenance than the milk of a half-starved goat, is well known. These instances, added to others of persons who have passed several weeks in a state of almost uninterrupted sleep, tend to prove that man himself may, under certain circumstances, continue in a torpid state.\n\nDuring this state of torpidity, the animals scarcely appear to live; sensation seems altogether lost; their irritability is so much diminished, that they may be cut, torn, or even broken to pieces, without expressing any mark of feeling, or giving any sign of motion; digestion seems entirely suspended; the secretions and excretions are discontinued. Some of the functions, however, are carried on. Respiration and circulation, though very languid, and sometimes scarcely perceptible, appear to go on in a degree sufficient to preserve the existence of the animal; and the action of the absorbents seems to be very little diminished, as appears from the gradual absorption of the fat. If the animal is taken from its place of confinement, and exposed to a gentle heat, it gradually recovers all its faculties; but if carried back to its cell, it relapses into the state of torpidity.\n\nThe long suspension of animation, of which several animals are susceptible, appears still more extraordinary than the torpidity above described. The common hair-worm (Gordius aquaticus) may, when dried, be preserved for an indefinite length of time, and when put into water, gradually recovers its usual activity of motion. See Helminthology, No. 32. One of the most remarkable cases of this suspended animation is that related of the garden snail, of which the following curious account has been given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1774. Mr. Stuckey Simon, a merchant in Dublin, whose father, a fellow of the Royal Society, and a lover of natural history, left to him a small collection of fossils and other curiosities, had amongst them the shells of some snails. About 15 years after his father's death (in whose possession they were many years), he by chance gave to his son, a child about 10 years old, some of these shells to play with. The boy put them into a flower-pot, which he filled with water, and the next day into a basin. Having occasion to use this, Mr. Simon observed that the animals had come out of their shells. He examined the child, who assured him that they were the same he had given him, and said he had also a few more, which he brought. Mr. Simon put one of them into water, and in an hour and a half after observed that it had put out its horns and body, which it moved but slowly, probably from weakness. Of Sleep Major Vallancey and Dr. Span were afterwards present, and saw one of the snails crawl out, the others being dead, most probably from their having remained some days in the water. Dr. Quin and Dr. Rutty also examined the living snail several times, and were greatly pleased to see him come out of his solitary habitation after so many years confinement. Dr. Macbride, and a party of gentlemen at his house, were also witnesses of this surprising phenomenon. Dr. Macbride has thus mentioned the circumstance: \"After the shell had lain about ten minutes in a glass of water that had the cold barely taken off, the snail began to appear; and in five minutes more we perceived half the body pushed out from the cavity of the shell. We then removed it into a basin, that the snail might have more scope than it had in the glass; and here, in a very short time, we saw it get above the surface of the water, and crawl up towards the edge of the basin. While it was thus moving about, with its horns erect, a fly chance to be hovering near, and, perceiving the snail, darted down upon it. The little animal instantly withdrew itself into the shell, but as quickly came forth again, when it found the enemy was gone off. We allowed it to wander about the basin for upwards of an hour, when we returned it into a wide-mouthed phial, wherein Mr. Simon had lately been used to keep it. He was so obliging as to present me with this remarkable shell; and I observed, at twelve o'clock, as I was going to bed, that the snail was still in motion, but next morning I found it in a torpid state, sticking to the side of the glass.\"\n\nThe still more extraordinary instances that have been related, on what many have considered authentic testimony, of toads having been found inclosed in the trunk of a large tree, or within a solid block of stone, appear almost incredible; and yet if we consider that M. Herissant preserved toads in a state of suspended animation for 18 months, in boxes covered with a thick coating of mortar (see Entomology, p. 286); that the snails mentioned in the above quotation, must have lain for at least 20 years; and that flies have been recovered after being immersed for many months in Madeira wine, it is difficult to say how long this suspended animation may not be continued.\n\nSimilar phenomena take place in the vegetable creation. Most of those plants which survive one year, often shed their leaves on the approach of winter; and, during this season, the motion of the sap ceases, and they have all the appearance of dead shrubs. The herbaceous tribes even die down to the roots, which, being mostly of the bulbous kind, afford shelter to the surviving germ; and are hence called, by botanists, the hybernacula of plants. On return of spring, the plant shoots anew from its winter's retreat, and flourishes with its former strength and beauty.\n\nSome plants are even capable of having their vitality, or rather the exercise of all their functions, suspended, as in the gordius and the snail, for an indefinite length of time. Mussels have been kept in a dried state in a hortus siccus for many years, and have shown no sign of life, till they were moistened and exposed to air, light, and a moderate heat, when they have recovered all their powers, have erected their stems, shot forth new branches, and flourished as at first.\nIt is almost impossible, in the present state of our physiological knowledge, to give any rational theory of these phenomena. The torpor of animals has been attributed to exhausted excitability, or exhausted senatorial power; to the effects of habit, and to the effect produced on the brain by suspended or diminished respiration. The last of these, though not quite satisfactory, appears to us the most probable hypothesis. It has been ably defended and illustrated by Dr George Kellie, in a paper in which he relates a remarkable case of torpor from cold.\n\n\"The powers of voluntary motion and of sensation (says Dr Kellie), are known to depend immediately upon the conditions of the brain and nerves; if, therefore, we could discover in what manner these organs are affected by any of the preceding events, we should advance considerably towards the solution of the questions above stated. (Namely, What is the order of succession between the diminished irritability of the heart, in consequence of the abstraction of calorific, and the complete torpor of the voluntary muscles and of the organs of sense, and how are the intervening effects connected?) Were the inactivity of these organs the direct effect of their diminished temperature; did the torpor in no case happen till the heat of the brain and nerves was reduced beneath the natural standard, there could be hardly ground for any farther inquiry. But, as it is not so, some other change, let's direct, must have occurred, in consequence of the connection of the brain with, and its dependence upon, some other of the functions antecedently and more immediately affected; and this function I apprehend to be respiration, between which and the energies of the nervous system a very intimate connection is maintained, through the changes produced on the blood during the pulmonary circulation. This dependence of the brain upon the properties of the blood, maintained by respiration, is evinced by a great variety of observations. Whatever impedes the respiratory changes of the circulating fluid debilitates or destroys the powers of muscular motion, as the respiration of noxious gases, of reduced or rarefied atmosphere; while greater exertions of muscular powers call for, and give occasion to more frequent respiration, more rapid consumption of air, and greater changes of the blood; and the breathing of more effective gases, as of the nitrous oxide, increases the motive and lenitive powers of animals. That these effects depend immediately upon the properties of the blood, as modified by respiration, acting on the brain has, I think, been proved by the experiments of Bichat, who, in a masterly manner, has traced the mutual connection and dependencies of the vital functions in his admirable Recherches Physiologiques sur la Vie et la Mort. The transfusion or injection of venous blood into the carotids induced asphyxia or death, the infant it reached the brain; an effect which did not follow the similar transfusion of arterial blood from the carotid of another. By these experiments, and by several other observations, he has shown, that the asphyxia which instantly follows impeded or suspended respiration is occasioned by the intrusion of dark, venous, unchanged blood upon the brain, and not, as has commonly been supposed, from this blood being incapable of stimulating the left side of the heart, which, on the contrary, continues to contract and to circulate the blood for some time after the voluntary functions are suspended; an observation confirmed also by Coleman and others.\n\nSuch then appears to be the connection between the functions of respiration and those of the brain. Now, in animals rendered torpid from cold, there are many observations which lead us to believe, that the immobility of the nervous system depends much, and very directly too, on the state of respiration.\n\n\"In the perfect torpor of the hibernating amphibia, respiration is completely suspended, and the consequent changes produced on the blood by that function totally prevented. This, which appeared from a variety of observations on the winter quarters of such animals found imbedded in mud, incased in ice, or cloed up in opera-cula of their own construction, for the occasion of excluding the air, has been amply confirmed by the pointed experiments of Spallanzani, lately published by Senchel.\"\n\nIn every case of torpor from cold, where the respiration falls short of this complete suspension, it is at least more or less impaired. How much the torpid state depends on this condition of the respiratory functions, farther appears from observing, that hibernating animals, even those not of the amphibious order, warned by the approach of winter, instinctively or indolently seek situations unfavourable to perfect respiration, where this function may be either inadequately or not at all performed, as by premature and involuntary interment under ground, in old walls, in mud, at the bottom of lakes, &c. The instinct of these animals, too, has been finely imitated by experiment, illustrating at once the object of this instinct, and confirming the opinion here advanced of its tendency. Thus the dormant hamster was found to regain and preserve its activity, when freely exposed to a pure atmosphere, the temperature, at the same time, not exceeding that at which it had formerly become torpid, or at which it returned to that state when again secluded under ground.\n\nThese observations seem conclusive on this point, and, with those already brought forward confirming the general by Smellie, connection established between the properties of the blood, as modified by respiration, and the functions of the brain, render it, I think, highly probable, that the torpor of the voluntary powers, in the cases now under consideration, is the consequence of a limited and imperfect respiration, antecedently induced by diminished temperature.\n\nObservation, indeed, is more deficient on this point with regard to the higher orders of animals, and to men, who only occasionally become torpid from cold. Yet more than analogy, which is here very strong, leads me to believe that, even in these, the functions of respiration are much and necessarily affected. The examples of cattle and of men remaining long torpid, deeply buried under snow, are pretty direct and convincing proofs of this.\n\nIf our induction from all these observations be admitted, we have the rudiments of a theory adequate to the explanation of the phenomena, in so far, at least, as the torpor of the voluntary powers is concerned.\n\nFrom the suspended or imperfect respiration, those changes, by which the blood is fitted for maintaining the activity of the senatorial system, are interrupted; this imperfect blood circulating slowly through the brain, directly impedes its functions, and so debilitates the excitability of the motive and senitive organs, that they become torpid. This enunciation may seem hypothetical; but let the proofs of the intimate connection between the respirable and senatorial functions be weighed; consider","sp":123,"ep":127},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Chap. XVI. Of Death.\n\nIn the article MAN, (No. 33. to the end) we have traced the progress of human life, from the cradle to the grave; and have briefly considered the phenomena and the consequences of natural death. In that article, and LONGEVITY, we have also stated the natural duration of human life, and the circumstances that tend to prolong our existence beyond the ordinary period. We shall not here enter again on any of these topics, except to give a more ample account of the gradual approaches of natural death, and shall then enumerate the causes which usually produce violent or accidental death, and mention the opinions of some of the best writers on the nature of death.\n\nNatural death is, in the present state of civilized society, by no means a common occurrence. When it does take place, its approach is slow and gradual. The whole life terminates in consequence of advanced age, (to use the language of a celebrated French physiologist,) dies in detail. His external functions successively cease to exert their action; all his senses are successively lost, or the ordinary causes of sensation pass over them without leaving their usual impressions. The sight becomes obscure, and at length the humours of the eye no longer transmit the rays of light; the ear receives only confused sounds, and frequently before death, is altogether insensible; the sense of touch, in consequence of the hardness and callousness of the cuticle, and the obliteration of many of the subcutaneous vessels, grows dull and uncertain; and all the parts depending on the skin show marks of weakness; the hair and the beard grow white, and a greater or less degree of baldness takes place; odours are no longer perceived, or they are perceived but faintly. The taste usually survives the rest of the senses; but that too, at last, grows equally obscure. The functions of the brain partake of the imbecility of the external senses. The imagination in particular becomes dull and often depraved; the memory no longer retains those occurrences which are every day taking place, though it recalls with increased relish and delight those of past times; the judgment becomes weak and wavering.\n\nFrom the universal agency exerted by the nervous system on all the animal functions, we must expect that when the former is impaired, the latter will be proportionally enfeebled. The faculties of locomotion and of speech are commonly the first of these that fail; the body totters at every step, the voice grows weak, and the tongue falters. The motion of the limbs is difficult and painful, and hence is but seldom willingly exerted. Not so with the vocal organs, though the impediments to utterance are evident and painful to his hearers, the old man himself seems scarcely to attend to them, but talks with proverbial garulity, and especially delights in recounting the scenes and actions of his youth.\n\nWhile the external functions, and those of the brain, are thus gradually impaired; the internal, or what are commonly called the vital and natural functions, as digestion, absorption, circulation, respiration, and secretion, proceed with but little derangement. The circulation and respiration are indeed slower than before, and the appetite is in general less keen and returns less frequently; but the digestive powers of the gastric fluids remain in full vigour; and even after death has taken place, are exerted on the coats of the stomach; absorption is also very active, and nutrition, at least in many parts of the body, is sufficiently evident. At length, however, all these functions lose their powers; digestion languishes; the secretions no longer take place; the circulation, especially in the minute vessels, becomes obscure, and being deprived of the tonic powers by which it was carried on, gradually ceases altogether; the heart no longer propels the blood from its ventricles; and the circulatory organs cease to take air, make their last expiration, and thus the natural life of man is terminated.\n\nAccidental death takes place in one of the following ways; either suddenly, in consequence of some violent great disturbance produced in the animal economy, or death, when a man is cut off by a sudden stroke of apoplexy, violent hemorrhage, apoplexia, &c., or by slow and gradual steps, in consequence of some less violent but still fatal disease. In the former case, it is sudden or violent death; in the latter lingering death.\n\nViolent death may take place first, either in the brain, the lungs, or the heart; but when the action of one of these organs ceases, that of the others soon terminates. The entire cessation of life seems, however, to be more sudden in the two latter cases, and most of all in the last; when the heart is wounded or ruptured, the animal dies instantly; when the lungs are rendered inactive in consequence of suffocation, the animal may live for several minutes, or for an hour or two; but when the brain is overwhelmed, he may survive for hours or even days. Thus it sometimes happens, in cases of apoplexy, that the patient lies motionless, speechless, and quite insensible to external stimuli, while the circulation and respiration continue, impeded indeed, but not destroyed, for a considerable time, though life, as appears from the event, be in a state of irrecoverable declension. We shall presently show how these circumstances have been explained.\n\nThe usual signs of approaching death are, a very quick and small pulse, scarcely distinguishable, and commonly intermitting; coldness, and generally clammy sweats about the extremities; a \"lack lustre\" eye, sunk in features, want of expression about the countenance, and a prominence of the bones of the face, with a corresponding hollowness in the cheeks, orbits, and especially\nespecially at the temples. These last appearances constitute the marks of what has been called facies Hippocratica. They are all signs of a loss of activity and power in the circulating and nervous systems. Under these bodily circumstances, the powers of the mind seem to decline, generally with an equal pace with those of the body; and when the medium through which the activity of the soul is manifested can no longer act, we cannot expect to find any further traces even of its existence. Yet at the period of its separation, we are told of brilliant mental exertions of powers of intellect, not equalled in the best portion of existence. It has not been our fortune to see such intellectual animation. At the moment of death, anxiety for those we have loved will sometimes occasion apparently disproportioned exertions; and as they were unexpected, we have been exaggerated. But in no instance could we ever detect the activity of mind independent of the body. To this temporary prison the soul is confined, till, by the destruction of the machine, its animating principle is emancipated, soaring probably in higher regions.\n\nA few cases have occurred, in which persons, who were thought dead, have recovered from what was really a state of suspended animation; and there is reason to believe, that some unhappy beings have been buried while in this seemingly lifeless state. It becomes, therefore, a matter of the highest importance to ascertain, with certainty, whether or not death has actually taken place. The ordinary signs of death, as enumerated by one of the latest writers on this subject, are as follows:\n\n1. The suspension of respiration.\n2. The rigidity of the limbs.\n3. The loss of sensation and motion.\n4. The want of pulsation in the heart and arteries.\n5. The spontaneous discharge of feces.\n6. The collapse, opacify, and want of luster in the eyes.\n7. The coldness of the body.\n8. The pallor or lividity of the countenance.\n9. The relaxation of the lower jaw.\n10. The regurgitation of liquids to the mouth.\n11. The insensibility of the pituitary membrane of the nose.\n12. The collapse, festering, and wrinkling of the lips.\n13. The hollowing of the temples, and thinness and contraction of the nose.\n\nMost of these signs highly have been shown to be fallacious; and none of them, except the last, are to be depended on with implicit confidence. Dr Davis recommends the following mode of procedure. \"As soon as the evident signs of life cease, let us place the body in a warm or dry bed, give a proper temperature to the air of the apartment, and employ every means for restoring it to life. If we judge, from the nature of the disease which preceded the death, that these means are useless, we may content ourselves with keeping the body, until its decomposition become complete; but let us never abandon an unfortunate person, who, perhaps, by perseverance in the proper means, may be restored to life: should he recover, he will be a living monument of unexpected resurrection, and of the unceasing efforts of humanity. If a person die of malignant fever, scurvy, internal inflammation, or any other disease which corrupts the fluids, soon after death the belly becomes black and swollen; black or livid spots appear on the limbs and back, the eyes become hollow and soft, and discharge a puriform fluid; the eyelids grow yellow; the mouth opens, because the lower jaw is relaxed; the skin gets soft, the muscles flaccid; and, lastly, the whole body exhales a putrid odor. All these phenomena united, constitute an infallible proof of real death.\"\n\nThe changes which the animal body undergoes in consequence of death, and during putrefaction, have been amply detailed and explained under Chemistry, chap. xix. sect. 2.\n\nIn treating of the general phenomena of life in the first chapter of this article, we made a few observations pertaining to the degree of vitality that appears in various tribes of organized beings. There is scarcely a more curious part of the physiology of death than the consideration of the greater or less difficulty with which it is produced in different animals. Some, as the herring and the whitling, die almost instantly on being removed from the situation in which they usually live. Some are killed by a slight blow on the nose or the neck; this is the case with the seal, the rat, the hare, and the rabbit. Others again retain life with great pertinacity. Among the mammalia, the cat is proverbial for being difficult to kill; the sloth has been known to live for above 40 days clinging to a pole, and entirely without food; and Dr Sparman affirms us, that the ratel, or honey weasel (Mustela mellicola), is so hardy that it is almost impossible to kill it; the colonists and Hottentots both affirm, says he, that it is almost impossible to kill this creature, without giving it a great number of violent blows on the nose; and it is remarkable that such a number of hounds as are able collectively to tear in pieces a lion of moderate size, are sometimes obliged to leave the ratel only apparently dead. Some fishes live for a long time after being removed from the water, and even after being gutted and cut in pieces, as the carp, the flounder, and the eel. It is among the reptiles, mollusca, and zoophytes, however, that we find the most remarkable instances of pertinacity of life. Referring the reader to the article Entomology for these instances in reptiles, and to Helminthology for those in zoophytes, we shall here only mention two among mollusca. The sea marigold (Actinia calendula) is destroyed with such difficulty, that after drilling the holes of the rock from which they appear, with an iron instrument, they have been known to rise again in the same places, and become as numerous as before in the course of a few weeks. Snails whose remarkable suspended animation we have already recorded, may be crushed beneath the foot, and will yet survive, and repair the breaches in their flaky covering; nay, they are capable of passing the ordeal of boiling water, as we learn from the relation of a lady who, wanting some small shells for a piece of grotto work, attempted to kill the animals by repeatedly pouring over them boiling water; but to her horror and astonishment, she observed them next day crawling about the edges of the vessel.\n\n(n) The work of M. Bruhier, sur l'Incertitude des Signes de la Mort, from which these remarks of Dr Davis appear chiefly to be taken, created so much alarm in France, that everybody dreaded being buried alive. To combat these terrors, M. Louis, in 1752 published his Lettres sur la Certitude des Signes de la Mort; in which he has very happily, and we think successfully, refuted the arguments of Bruhier, and has thereby relieved the minds of his readers from one of the most dreadful apprehensions that can appal us on this side the grave.\nin which she had scalded them*. It is in vain for us to attempt any explanation of these extraordinary phenomena. We must refer them to some principle in the animal economy which is at present unknown.\n\nThe remote causes of death have been, by Dr Ontyd, arranged under 12 general heads, to which he gives the name of clasps. These we shall enumerate, with their principal subdivisions.\n\nI. Death arising from the mechanism of the body.\nII. Death from the passions of the mind.\n   1. Exciting passions; 2. Depressing passions.\nIII. Death from superabundance or deficiency of heat.\n   1. From superabundant heat; 2. From deficient heat.\nIV. Death from electricity.\nV. Death from noxious gases.\n   1. From hyperoxygenized gases; 2. From deoxygenized gases; 3. From peculiarly stimulating gases.\nVI. Death from poisons.\n   1. Animal poisons; 2. Vegetable poisons; 3. Mineral poisons.\nVII. Death from universal disease.\n   1. Fevers; 2. Febrile diseases (exanthemata).\n\nThese seven classes are supposed to produce death by the immediate extinction of the vital principle; the five following are supposed to effect this by suppressing the action of some vital organ, or by disordering the chain of the vital powers by destroying the action of some of the intermediate links.\n\nVIII. Death from inflammations.\n   1. Inflammations of the head; 2. Of the breast; 3. Of the belly.\n\nIX. Death from fluxes.\n   1. Alvine fluxes; 2. Hemorrhages.\n\nX. Death from cachectics.\n   1. Ulcers; 2. Atrophies; 3. Debilities and privations.\n\nXI. Death from diseases of the nervous system.\n   1. Atony; 2. Spasm.\n\nXII. Death from diseases of the secretory organs.\n   1. From altered action; 2. From altered structure*.\n\nThe manner in which these causes operate in terminating life, is thus stated by the same author.\n\nThe causes of the first class act by inducing too great a rigidity of the solids, and by rendering them insensible to stimuli; the necessary effects of the continued action of the powers of life. In death from causes of the second class, the person dies in consequence of apoplexy, syncope, or suffocation, the brain, the heart, or the lungs being overwhelmed by accumulated blood. The causes of the third class act in a similar manner with those of the second; that of the fourth by suddenly extinguishing the vital principle; those of the fifth always act by inducing suffocation. The causes of the sixth class act in four ways: 1. By abolishing the vital principle by the violence of their stimulus; 2. By destroying the action of the brain, the heart, or the lungs; 3. By producing mortification of the intestinal canal; 4. By secretly and infinitely destroying life. Those of the seventh class act in five ways: 1. and 2. As in the last; 3. By local inflammation; 4. By mortification of some vital organ; 5. By a change in the organic structure of the intestinal canal inducing a colligative diarrhoea; 6. By colligative sweats wasting the body.\n\nThe causes of the eighth class act in four ways: 1. By inducing violent convulsions; 2. As in the two last; 3. By suppressing the action of some vital function from the violence of the inflammation; 4. By mortification. The ninth clas may act in five modes: 1. By spasm; 2. By local syncope; 3. By impeded action of some vital organ; 4. By mortification or sphacelus; 5. By wasting the strength in fruitless exertions. The tenth clas may act in no less than nine ways: 1. By the consumption of some vital organ, or destroying the tone of the whole body; 2. By the violence of the noxious stimulus; 3. By suffocation; 4. By apoplexy; 5. By syncope; 6. By hemorrhage; 7. By colligative diarrhoea; 8. By mortification of some organ; 9. By malignant fever from absorbed ichorous matter. The causes of the eleventh clas act only in two ways: 1. By violent spasm; 2. By apoplexy. Those of the twelfth clas, produce death in three modes: 1. By the flow effects of the noxious stimulus; 2. By the continually stimulating noxious power alone, or by this and the continual wasting of the blood, to form some peculiar secretion; 3. By impeding or destroying the function of a vital organ*.\n\nMany of these modes of operation are very ill-defined, and they may all be reduced to about eight or ten, or perhaps even fewer.\n\nDeath has been defined the separation of the soul from Nature of the body; the extinction of the vital principle; the extinction of the faculty of answering a stimulus; &c., &c., &c.* Ontyd.\n\nPerhaps we cannot describe it better than by calling it the irrecoverable cessation of all the bodily functions. By this character we distinguish it from suspended animation and lethargy, in which some of the functions continue; while we acknowledge the survival of the immaterial part of our frame.\n\nIt has been the general opinion among philosophers, both of ancient and modern times, that death produces only a change of the elements or principles of the organized body; and does not affect the annihilation of any part. Modern chemistry has fully confirmed this opinion, and has shown that by putrefaction the body is dissolved into a few earthly, saline, and gaseous products, all capable of entering into new combinations, and thus constituting a part of future bodies. See Chemistry, No 2572, and Man, No 44.\n\nOf all the writers on the nature and phenomena of death, with whom we are acquainted, none has treated the subject with such accuracy and philosophic method, as Bichat. With a summary of some of the leading principles of this able physiologist we shall close the present chapter, and thus terminate our physiological enquiries.\n\nWe have already mentioned Bichat's division of life opinions of into animal and organic: see No 49. Proceeding on Bichat's principle of this division, he conceives that the two lives terminate in different ways, and that one often terminates while the other remains active. In the natural death that happens from old age, the animal life gradually ceases in the order we have described, No 367, while the organic life remains. The same happens in those cases of violent death where life first ceases in the brain, this organ being the centre of animal life. In other cases of violent or accidental death, the organic life first ceases in its central organs, the heart or the lungs; but in these cases, the animal life also is speedily suppressed.\n## TABLE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES RESPECTING THE ORGANIC FUNCTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY.\n\n| I.

He first considers those cases of sudden death that commence with the death of the heart; then those originating in the lungs; and lastly those originating in the brain. He shows how, one of these functions ceasing, the others successively stop; he points out the mechanism by which the death of all the parts follows that of the organ first affected; and he determines, according to his own principles, the nature of the several diseases by which the life of the heart, the lungs, or the brain, is extinguished.\n\nWe consider this as the most interesting part of his valuable work, and it well deserves the attentive perusal of every medical man. We regret that we cannot do more than extract from it the view given by the author of the successive phenomena produced by the influence which the death of each of the vital organs exercises on the general death of the body.\n\nWhenever the heart ceases to act, says Bichat, general death comes in the following manner. The action of the brain ceases for want of excitation; and from the same defect, the sensation, locomotion, and speech, which immediately depend on the general sensorium, are interrupted. Besides, for want of the excitation of part of the blood, the organs of these functions would cease to act, even though the brain were supposed capable of exerting on them its usual influence. The whole of the animal life, then, is suddenly arrested. The man, from the moment that his heart dies, ceases to exist with respect to surrounding objects.\n\nThe interruption of organic life, which has commenced through the circulation, operates at the same time through the respiration. The mechanical actions of the lungs no longer proceed when the brain ceases to act, since on this organ depends the action of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. The chemical changes can no longer take place, when the heart can neither receive nor convey the materials necessary for their development. In short, general death continues to proceed in a gradual manner, by the interruption of secretion, respiration, and nutrition. These are the effects produced when death is the consequence of a wound of the heart or large blood-vessels, a rupture of the heart, or similar accidents.\n\nThe series of phenomena that take place in death, as commencing in the lungs, is different according as the mechanical or the chemical action of these organs is first arrested. I. In the former case, as when death is produced by an extensive wound or laceration of the diaphragm, by the fracture of a great many ribs at the same time, &c., they proceed as follows: 1. Cessation of the mechanical action; 2. Cessation of the chemical phenomena, for want of the air which supported them; 3. Cessation of the brain's action for want of the red blood by which it was excited; 4. Interruption of animal life, of sensation, locomotion, and speech, from the loss of the exciting powers of the brain and the red blood on the organs of these functions; 5. Stoppage of the general circulation; 6. Stoppage of the circulation in the capillaries, of secretion, absorption, exhalation, for want of the excitation exerted on their organs by the red blood; 7. Cessation of digestion, for want of secretion, and of excitation of the digestive organs. II. When the chemical action of the lungs is interrupted, as when an animal is confined in a vacuum; in cases of strangulation, suffocation, drowning, &c., the phenomena of death proceed in the following order: 1. Interruption of the chemical phenomena; 2. Consequent fulsomeness of action in the brain; 3. Cessation of sensation, voluntary motion, voice, and the mechanical functions of respiration; 4. Stoppage of the heart's action, and of the general circulation; 5. Termination of the capillary circulation, of secretion, exhalation, absorption, and, by consequence, of digestion; 6. Cessation of animal heat, which, being the result of all the functions, must cease when all these are terminated.\n\nThe phenomena of general death commencing in the brain come on in the following series: 1. Cessation of death concerning the brain's action; 2. Sudden interruption of sensation in and voluntary motion; 3. Simultaneous paralysis of the diaphragm, and intercostal muscles; 4. Interruption of the mechanical phenomena of respiration, and, by consequence of voice; 5. Cessation of the chemical phenomena; 6. Passage of the black blood into the system of red blood; 7. Impeded circulation, from the action of the black blood on the heart and arteries, and from the immobility of all the parts, especially the organs of the chest; 8. Death of the heart, and stoppage of the general circulation; 9. Simultaneous interruption of organic life, especially in the parts that are usually penetrated by red blood; 10. Abolition of animal heat.\n\nWe have now gone through the series of physiological enquiries, into which we proposed to enter in this article. In forming an estimate of the merit due to our labours, we request that our readers will consider the article as in a great measure supplemental to many that have preceded it in the course of the present work. It has been our principal object to fill up blanks and supply deficiencies, especially with respect to Comparative Physiology; and to form, with those preceding articles which have a reference to the animal economy, particularly Anatomy, Medicine, Midwifery, Chemistry, Man, one connected, if not uniform whole. The difficulty of the task we had undertaken will probably be admitted as some apology for the imperfect execution of it; while the variety and interesting nature of the subjects which we have treated, with the numerous references to the most respectable sources of information, will, we trust, render this article acceptable both to the general and the scientific reader.","sp":127,"ep":135},{"h":"PHYSIOLOGY","t":"Respiration, relations of, with sensation, No 257\nmotion, 258\ndigestion, 259\n\nRespirations, ordinary number of in a minute, 224\n\nReverie, 354\nRicherand's explanation of ventriloquism, 252\nRumination explained, 158\nin man, cases of, Note G, page 490.\n\nRunning explained, 139\nRu\u00df's ideas of vitality, 72\n\nSecretion, ch. x.

It is a large handsome city, whose name is derived from its pleasant situation, in a fruitful plain, on the Via Emilia, about half a mile from the Po. It is the see of a bishop suffragan of Bologna, and has a university, but of no great fame. It is defended by a wall and a strong citadel, and is reckoned about three miles in circumference, so that it is somewhat bigger than Parma. The houses are low, but well built; the great street called the Stradone is in a direct line and of equal breadth, with a foot-way fenced with palisades on each side like London, and is about 3000 feet long. The houses are generally built of brick, and some of them are prettily painted. The cathedral is an old structure, but well adorned within. The duke of Parma, who is sovereign of Piacenza, has a palace in the city built by Vignola. There are many excellent paintings in this place. There are two chapels painted, one with the history of St Catherine, and the other with a picture of Christ, as also the altar of the church of St Augustin, all by Perdonone. In the same church there is a fine picture of the blest virgin, St Peter, and St Paul, by Paolo Veronese. At the Capuchins there is a Francis by Guercino. There is a fountain said to have been erected here by Julius Caesar, and the equestrian statues of the famous general Alexander I., duke of Parma and Placentia, and of his son Ranuccio, both in the great square. In the palace of Scotti, there are a great many fine pictures by Lanfranco, who had been a page in their family, and among the rest the rape of Helen, the taking of Troy, the blest virgin, and St Francis. The trade of this city consists chiefly in their cheese, as at Parma, these cities being surrounded with the richest pasture grounds in Italy; though the greatest part of what is called Parmesan cheese is made in the duchy of Milan, and particularly at Lodi. See Parmesan Cheese.\u2014Without the walls, which are washed by the rivers Trebbia and Po, there is a large seminary or college, magnificently erected by Cardinal Alberoni, a native of this city, but considerably hurt by the modern Goths in the last war. Towards the north of the city is the mouth of the river Trebbia, famous for the victory which Hannibal obtained over the Romans.","sp":143,"ep":143},{"h":"PIANO FORTE","t":"or Forte Piano, is a musical instrument, which is too well known to require any detailed description. We shall here, however, notice some of its peculiarities. The voice, it has been observed, is the original musical instrument; of this all other instruments are to be considered but as imitations; and it is remarkable with what promptitude, as well as accuracy, the voice of man obeys the impulse of the heart. Even a coarse ear is hurt by an error in its tone, amounting to what is called a comma; and a limited voice can execute melodies which include 12 notes, or an octave and a fifth. Between these extremes the motion of the glottis does not amount to one-twelfth of an inch, which must therefore be divided by the most ordinary finger into more than 1000 parts. All this too, without any seeming effort of thought, is done in an instant, and repeated with rapidity, without mistaking one of the divisions.\n\nThe great object in the construction of musical instruments is, to bring them as near as possible to express the sounds produced by the human voice: the violin, however, and a few of the simple wind instruments, are the only ones found fully to express these momentary gradations of sentiment, and those tender and delicate emotions with which the heart is agitated. For the purpose of removing this defect of harmonic instruments, the swell was added to the organ. Similar improvements were also attempted on other instruments of the same kind, and in the same way. The harpsichord was flutted like the swell organ, and was opened by means of pedals, when the performer wished to enforce the sound. But as this was found not to succeed well, other methods were tried, and in particular unisons were added to each note, which were brought on, either by means of pedals, or by another set of keys; and in this way the power of the harpsichord was greatly improved. Among all the keyed instruments, the English piano forte seems to merit the preference, on account of the superior force of tone, adequate sweetness, and great variety of voice, of which, by the ingenuity of British artists, it has now become susceptible. It has been called a national instrument, because it is said to be an English contrivance, the invention of the celebrated poet, Mafon. Mr Mafon had seen some attempts that were made by the Germans to make keyed dulcimers, which were in some measure susceptible of the forte and piano; but as they were all constructed on one principle, and required a particular touch of the finger, which was of difficult acquisition, and which spoiled it for harpsichord practice; as they were also deficient in delicacy and justness; and as the performer was by no means certain of producing the very strength of sound intended, Mr Mafon removed all those imperfections, by detaching the mallet entirely from the key, and giving them only a momentary connection. It is by this improvement that the English piano forte is distinguished from all others. Mr Mafon's general principle may be fully understood by the following description. In the figure on Plate CCCXVIII. the parts are represented in their state of inaction. The key ABK turns, as usual, on the round edge of the bar E, and a pin P, driven into the bar, keeps it in its place.\nPIA\n\nThe dot F represents a section of the string. ED is the mallet, having a hinge of vellum, by which it is attached to the upper surface of the bar E. At the other end is the head D, of wood, covered with some folds of prepared leather. The mallet lies in the position represented in the figure, its lower end resting on a cushion-bar K, which lies horizontally under the whole row of mallets. The key AR has a pin C, tipped with a bit of the softest cork or buckskin. This reaches to within \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of an inch of the shank of the mallet, but must not touch it. The distance Ee is about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)d or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the length of the shank. When the end A of the key is pressed down on the stuffing (two or three thicknesses of the most elastic woollen felt) it raises the mallet, by means of the pin C, to the horizontal position Ed, within \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of an inch of the wire F; but it cannot be so much pressed down as to make the mallet touch the wire. At the same time that the key raises the mallet by means of the pin C, it also lifts off the damper G (a bit of sponge) from the wire. This damper is fixed on the end of a little wooden pin Gg, connected with the lever gH; which has a vellum hinge at H. This motion of the damper is caused by the pin I, which is fixed into the key near to R. These pieces are so adjusted, that the first touch of the key lifts the damper, and, immediately after, the pin C acts on the shank of the mallet. As it acts so near to its centre of motion, it causes the head D to move briskly through a considerable arch Dd. Being made extremely moveable, and very light, it is thus lifted beyond the horizontal position Ed, and it strikes the wire F, which is now at liberty to vibrate up and down, by the previous removal of the damper G. Having made its stroke, the mallet falls down again, and rests on the soft substance on the pin C. It is of essential importance that this mallet be extremely light. Were it heavy, it would have too much force, after rebounding from the wire, that it would rebound from the pin C, and again strike the wire. For it will be recollected, that the key is, at this time, down, and the pin C raised as high as possible, so that there is very little room for this rebound. Lessening the momentum of the mallet by making it very light, making the cushion on the top of the pin C very soft, and great precision in the shape and figure of all the parts, are the only securities against the disagreeable rattling which these rebounds would occasion. In respect to the solidity and precision of workmanship, the British instruments are unrivalled, and vast numbers of them have been sent to all parts of the continent.\n\nAs the blow of so light a mallet cannot bring much sound from a wire, it has always been found necessary to have two strings for each note. Another circumstance contributes to enfeeble the sound. The mechanism necessary for producing it makes it almost impossible to give any considerable extent to the belly or sound board of the instrument. There is seldom any more of it than what occupies the space between the tuning pins and the bridge. This is the more to be regretted, because the baffles are commonly covered strings, that they may be of a moderate length. The bass notes are also of brass, which has a considerably lower tone than a steel wire of the same diameter and tension. Yet even this substitution for steel in the bass strings is not enough. The highest of them are much too slack, and the lowest ones must be loaded, to compensate for want of length.\n\nThis greatly diminishes the fullness, and still more the Piano Forte, mellowness and distinctness of the tone, and frequently makes the very lowest notes hardly appreciable. This inequality of tone about the middle of the instrument is somewhat diminished by constructing the instrument with two bridges; one for the steel, and the other for the brass wires. But still the bass notes are very much inferior to the treble.","sp":143,"ep":144},{"h":"PIASTUS","t":"a native of Poland, was originally a wheelwright and the son of Cosifco, a citizen of Cracow. He flourished in the year 830, when on the extinction of the family of Popiel great disputes arose about his successor, and Cracow was afflicted with a severe famine. During this extremity, when the people were dropping down in the streets, two angels in human forms, as the story is told, took up their residence with Piastus, who was celebrated for his piety and extensive charity. He had nothing left but a small cask of the common liquor of the country, and this he presented to his new guests, who, charmed with his hospitality, promised him the crown of Poland. The faith of Piastus was equal to his other virtues: he implicitly believed the word of his guests; he piously followed their directions in every particular. He was ordered to distribute the liquor out of his little cask to the multitude: he did so, and found that it was inexhaustible. The people were astonished; all cried out, \"A miracle!\" and the electors determined to choose a person in whose favour Heaven had so visibly declared: Piastus was accordingly taken from his shop, and raised to the ducal dignity.\n\nSuch is the relation of the canon of Cracow, which differs in many particulars from the account given by Guagnini, and several other historians. According to them, Piastus had prepared a small collation, to entertain some friends who were assembled at the birth of a child. Two pilgrims, Paul and John, afterwards murdered at Rome, came about this time to Cracow. They begged charity at the door of the election-hall, and were rudely repulsed; upon which they stumbled on the house of Piastus, and were kindly received. The miracle we have mentioned was wrought by them; and the two pilgrims, and not angels, were the instruments of the elevation of the hospitable wheelwright. Though we pay but little regard to the marvellous means by which Piastus ascended the ducal throne of Poland, it would be presumptuous entirely to omit a fact attested by all the writers upon this subject: it was proper, therefore, to take notice of it, and we leave the rest to the reader's judgement.\n\nBeing now raised to the supreme dignity, he was not intoxicated with his prosperity. His natural charity, benevolence, and sweetness of disposition, remained: nothing was altered but his power of doing good. He was truly called the father of his people: the injured never returned unredeemed, nor merit unrewarded. Piastus wiped the tear from the eyes of the widow; and was himself the guardian of the orphan, and the general patron of the poor and distressed. His excellent inclinations served him in the room of great abilities; and the happiness that his people enjoyed made them forget that their prince was not born a statesman and a warrior. Several intestine commotions arose during his administration, all which he quelled by the mildness and clemency of his nature: his nobility were ashamed\nPiafus ashamed of rebelling against a sovereign who devoted his whole life to render his people happy. He removed the court from Cracow, a city which he detested, because it was the scene of Piafus's crimes and tragic end, and fixed his residence at Gniezno, where he died beloved, esteemed, and even adored by his subjects.\n\nIt is in memory of this excellent prince, that all the natives of Poland, who have been since promoted to the ducal or regal dignity, were called Piafus, in contradiction to the foreigners.\n\nPiafus associated his son Ziemowit with him in the government before his death; a circumstance of much benefit to the people.","sp":144,"ep":145},{"h":"PIAZZA","t":"in Building, popularly called piache, an Italian name for a portico, or covered walk, supported by arches.","sp":145,"ep":145},{"h":"PIBROCH","t":"says Dr Beattie*, is a species of tune peculiar I think, to the Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland.

He was the youngest son of John Francis of Mirandola, and Julia, a lady of the noble family of Boiard. Some of the credulous historians of the time have related, that at his birth a globe of fire was seen to rest upon his mother's bed, portending, say they, by its shape the perfection of his genius, and by its element, the celestial turn of his mind. As soon as he was capable of receiving instruction, he was placed by his mother's care under the most able masters, and very early distinguished himself by the vigour of his application, and the strength of his memory; of which such prodigies are related as would be very difficult to credit, were we not assured by some modern instances, of the perfection to which that faculty may be carried. At the age of fourteen he was sent by his mother's direction, who was desirous that he should assume the clerical functions, to Bologna, at that time the principal resort of those who studied the pontifical law. After spending two years there, he became disgusted with this pursuit, although such was his industry, even at that early age, that he compiled an epitome of the pontifical epistles or decrets. His disposition, however, strongly led him to the pursuit of philosophy, with an eager curiosity to penetrate the secrets of nature and science; with this view he travelled over Italy and France, visited the most celebrated schools of each, and studied under the most famous teachers of both countries. After seven years spent in this course of instruction, and at the age of twenty-three, he went to Rome, and, after the fashion of the scholars of that time, brought himself into notice by publicly proposing literary questions for disputation. This sort of challenge was very common in that age, and, when printing was scarcely practised, and the name of a man of learning less rapidly extended than it is now, was almost the only method that a person of superior attainments had to make himself known. Mirandola proposed 999 questions, or as they were called conclusiones, in dialectics, mathematics, natural philosophy, and divinity, drawn not only from the stores of the Latin and Greek, but from the mysteries of the Hebrews and the arcana of the Chald\u00e6ans and Arabians. In addition to the endless topics of metaphysics, theology, and the ordinary subjects of disputation, into which he entered very profoundly, the conclusiones involved the ancient and obscure philosophy of Pythagoras, Trismegistas, and Orpheus; the doctrines of the Cabala, or mystic interpretation of the sacred writings, according to the Hebrews, taught by Origen and Hilarius; the extent, uses, and learning of natural magic, which was vindicated from the vulgar reproach of impiety and necromancy. Seventy-two new physical and metaphysical dogmata of the author's invention were likewise proposed and defended. These propositions, according to the ostentatious practice on these occasions, were fixed in the most public places in Rome, and the proposer engaged to defray the expenses of any one who should come from a distance for the purpose of disputing with him. This challenge did not bring forward any disputants, but exposed Mirandola to much envy and jealousy, particularly from the professors of science at Rome, who felt the reflection that would be cast upon their credit by their declining a competition which they durst not encounter. Unable to injure his fame as a scholar, they made a much more dangerous attack upon the foundations of his faith; thirteen questions were selected, which were charged with the terrible suspicion of heresy and contempt of the ordinances of the church; a suspicion very readily listened to by the church when directed against great learning, which the increasing influence of philosophy and letters began to make her watch with extreme jealousy. Mirandola repelled this attack by publishing his Apologia, or Defence of the accused Propositions; which if he did not effectually clear away the suspicions he had incurred, tended to confirm his enemies in their dread of his learning and powers; and it must be owned that, overlook-\ning the misapplication of talents to such subjects, the Apologia exhibits a command of profound and well digested learning and keen argument, truly astonishing at the age of twenty-three. This work, and the difficulties it contained of certain delicate points, added to some hints of the limits of pontifical control in matters of faith, were so disagreeable to Pope Innocent VIII. that he interdicted the reading both of the Apology and the disputed questions. The love of glory, however, was not Mirandola's only passion: his youth, splendid accomplishments, and the graces of his person, for which he is said to have been remarkable, attracted the admiration and carefess of many distinguished Roman ladies, who united the love of letters to that of pleasure, a taste very common amongst the Italian ladies of that age. The young philosopher yielded to the force of these allurements, or rather, according to the account of his nephew, and biographer, Francisco de Mirandola, eagerly followed the bent of his disposition, naturally inclined to obey the attractions of beauty.\n\nBut this life of pleasure, however suitable to his condition and inclinations, was of a short continuance. Irritated by the relentless persecutions of his enemies, and obliged perpetually to defend himself against the imputation of heresy, the most formidable calamity which in that age any man could have to contend with, he detached himself from vicious pleasures, and regulated his manner of life by rigidly observing the laws of abstinence imposed by Christianity; for being a firm adherent to the Christian doctrines, the charge of infidelity and the vigilance of his enemies made him the more solicitous to guard against the appearance of disobeying them. Becoming from this time wholly devoted to learning, he soon acquired such celebrity that the most eminent scholars from all parts of Italy came to visit him for conversation or instruction. As a proof of the sincerity of his reformation, he committed to the flames five books of elegiac poetry which he had composed on the subject of his amours, together with numerous pieces in Tuscan verse, which had been addressed to his various mistresses. There is perhaps reason to lament that the zeal of a new convert would not be satisfied without this sacrifice. It must, however, be considered that the spirit of religion at that period exacted many sacrifices from the professors of Christianity, which the lenient temper of these times does not call for. An example of this severity is to be met with amongst the works that still remain of Mirandola; at the end of which, in the folio edition published by his nephew, we find a learned and entertaining comment, in the Italian language, upon a composition of his friend Girolamo Benivieni, entitled *Una Canzone de Amore secundo la mente et opusum de Platonici.* \"A poetical treatise upon love, explaining the doctrines of the Platonists.\" The author, Girolamo, informs the reader, in a short preface, that he had determined to suppress this poem and comment out of regard to his friend's character and his own; deeming it unbecoming a professor of Christianity, in treating of celestial and divine love, \"to treat of it as a Platonist and not as a Christian;\" but that having lent it to some of his friends for their perusal, an imperfect and erroneous copy was printed, which obliged him, but not till after the death of Mirandola, to publish it correctly; and he takes care to allege, in excuse for himself, that he has apprized the reader of his plan by the title of the poem, and warned him in all places where Plato's opinions depart from those of Christ, that the doctrines of a gentile and a heathen are not entitled to the least weight compared with the reasonings of the Christian theologians, \"and particularly the irrefragable arguments of the angelic doctor St Thomas of Aquino.\"\n\nThe first fruit of Mirandola's devotion to sacred literature was the Heptaplus, or Comment upon the Six Days of the first Chapter of Genesis, which was written in 1491. Two years afterwards he published a treatise in ten chapters, *de Enne et Uno,* the object of which was to reconcile the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle, and to demonstrate that the disputes of their respective followers originated in a misconception of the opinions of these philosophers relative to the *Enn* and *Unum,* at that time a subject of mighty strife among the learned. This treatise was held in high esteem by both sides. It was the last work of consequence that the author lived to complete; but he had laid the plan of a vast and comprehensive work, which his early death prevented the execution of. This was no less than to confound the seven enemies of the Christian church, by examining and refuting all their errors. In the prosecution of this design, he had composed and perfected before his death twelve books against astrology, the most popular and the most pernicious superstition which then infected the world. Paulus Jovius, bishop of Nocera, has left a testimony to the merits of this work, which is above all other encomiums:\u2014\"In this excellent though unfinished work, Mirandola attacked the astrologers with such erudition and keenness, and so ably exposed the absurdity and vanity of the whole art of divination, that he seems to have deterred the professors of the occult sciences from writing.\"\n\nThis great design, as well as many others which Mirandola had formed, particularly that of a more complete effay towards reconciling the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, was frustrated by his death. From the time that he left Rome, which was soon after the publication of the Apologia, Mirandola generally resided either at Ferrara or at Florence. The friendship of the prince of Ferrara and its vicinity to his paternal seat attracted him to the former place; but Florence was the most agreeable to him, on account of the society of literary men which it afforded, and particularly of Politian and Lorenzo de Medici, with whom he entertained a close friendship. Besides these two illustrious men, his society was cultivated by other eminent scholars, among whom was the learned and unfortunate Hieronymus Savonarola, and Hermolans Barbarus: Petrus Crinitus, the pupil of Politian, mentions him as excelling all his companions in the erudition and eloquence of his conversation. The same author has left us an account of his diligent, laborious studies; for when Politian had expressed in his presence high admiration of his great genius and learning, Mirandola with singular modesty answered, c. 2., that he deserved no praise but for his affluence of application.\u2014\"Gratulandum potius, intelligite, affiduis vigilis atque lucubrationibus, quam nostro ingenio plaudendum.\"\n\nHis library likewise is celebrated by the same writer, c. 2., and is said by Francisco de Mirandola to have cost 7000 pieces of gold. His accomplishments were not confined to subjects of abstruse literature; in his youth he was much attached to music, in which he acquired such skill, that...\nthat some of his melodies were publicly received, and held in great esteem. It might also be concluded, from an anecdote related by Petrus Crinitus, that he was not unacquainted with physic; for according to that author, when Hermolaus Barbarus was seized at Rome with a dangerous fever, Mirandola sent him from Florence a medicine prepared by himself. No man ever testified a more sincere devotion for learning and philosophy, to the contempt of all other qualifications, than the Prince of Mirandola. He possessed a very large estate, which he bestowed almost entirely upon works of charity, except what was spent in collecting books, and entertaining and providing for literary men. At length, however, about three years before his death, he made over to his nephew Franciscus his principalities and possessions in Mirandola, and obtained a confirmation of the grant from Maximilian, the Roman emperor, to whom that principality was subject. He referred to himself only enough to purchase a small estate near Ferrara, where he spent the remainder of his life, except when he resided at Florence, in elegant and learned retirement. His mother, under whose care he received his education, had destined him for the church; and he was often urged by his friends to embrace the sacred profession, with the certainty of the highest honours and emoluments: but nothing could induce him to quit the life that he had chosen. He died of a fever at Florence, in the year 1494, in the thirty-first year of his age, on the same day that Charles IX. of France entered that city on his famous expedition into Italy. That monarch, hearing of Mirandola's illness, as he approached the city, sent two of his own physicians to his assistance; but in spite of their aid, the violence of his disorder put an end to his existence in thirteen days.\n\nWith respect to the works of this author, something has already been said, and little more remains to be observed. The Conclusions afford a very complete specimen of the learning of the age, and of what were deemed the most valuable purposes to which learning could be applied. However useless and unprofitable these purposes may appear to us, it will not be denied by anyone, who has the curiosity to look through the Conclusions, that the mass of learning, which must have been possessed by the proposer of them, is prodigious; when it is recollected that, at the time he propounded them, he was no more than twenty-three years of age. For there is not the least reason to suppose, that a person whose works prove him to have been a man of profound learning, and who, in an age and nation distinguished by some of the brightest scholars that ever appeared, was ranked by their own judgment among the first, should have challenged the discussion of any of the proposed subjects, without being well provided with the knowledge necessary for such a debate. The manner in which the questions were propounded leave little room to doubt that the author was deeply versed in the respective subjects of them; and the Apology for the accused propositions, particularly those de Salute Origenis and de Magia atque Cabalae, discover familiarity with the writings of the Fathers, as well as with the Greek and Hebrew classics, and a facility of language and argument that could not be acquired at that age without extraordinary powers of mind. It would be worth while to transcribe the whole of this curious piece for the amusement of such of our readers as may not have access to the original, but our limits do not admit of it.\n\nIt is curious to observe how greatly the sudden growth of learning outstripped that of solid science. No age, perhaps, was ever so remarkable for the learning which it produced as the period from the middle of the fifteenth century to the beginning of the sixteenth; yet, except the ineffable obligations we owe to the learned men of that time for their editions of the classics, later ages have been little benefited by their works, which are either lost or neglected, and even the sciences they treated of exploded and ridiculed. School-divinity and metaphysics, though the most attended to, were not the only studies in which the vast erudition of that age was wasted. The mysterious doctrines of the Cabala formed a favourite study of some of the most learned scholars. The proposition which laid Pica open to the indignation of the church, was that in which he asserted the orthodoxy of Origen; for Origen, notwithstanding his meritorious labours in the cause of Christianity, his daring zeal and self-martyrdom, and notwithstanding the defence of Eusebius, was configned by the sentence of the church to inevitable damnation, on account of his errors in the mysteries of the faith. To question his perdition, therefore, was to deny that the church was the interpreter of the divine intentions. The defence of this part of the Conclusions is written with a boldness that could hardly be expected from an Italian of the fifteenth century. But the hardest of these propositions was that in which it is asserted, that faith is not in a man's own power. In defending this and the other propositions, which were taxed with heresy, Pica probably relied less on the spirit and ability of his justification, than on his own high rank and station, together with the countenance and protection of his powerful friends, particularly the Medici, whose liberality of sentiment in regard to religious points was so notorious, that even Leo X. has been directly charged, not only with heresy, but infidelity.*\n\n* Milner's Hist. of the Church, vol. iv.\n\nBy the Cabala, a term at this time generally misapprehended, was understood sometimes a species of divine magic operating by the agency of good spirits, as magic commonly so called was supposed to do by that of evil beings; but the true definition of it, as received by the best of its professors, is given by Reuchlinus (a), in his treatise addressed to Lorenzo de Medici, Divinae Revelationis ad salutarem Dei et formarum separatarum contemplationem traditae symbolica receptio,\u2014a symbolic acceptance of the Mosaic history (for that is meant by divina revelation) which produced a pure and perfect acquaintance with the nature of the divinity and of spirits; and according to the opinions of some, which seem to be revived by the modern Swedenborgians, this knowledge, when sublimed to the highest perfection it was capable of, and accompanied with perfect purity, was believed to\n\n(a) This treatise, which contains the whole learning upon a subject once held in the highest veneration by men of learning, is very curious, and is to be found in the folio edition of Mirandola's works, published at Basil, in 1557.\nto raise the mind to an absolute familiarity with good angels, by whose affluence the professors of the cabalistic secrets were enabled to do miraculous things. This art was derived from the rabbinical doctors, who were at first called Thalmudists; and, about the middle of the 15th century, according to Pica de Mirandola, its professors were denominated Cabalists, Cabalists, or Cabalists, according to their different degrees of perfection: they afterwards, however, departed from their masters the Thalmudists; the latter, according to Reuchlinus, being chiefly intent upon the law and the explanation of it, while the former, paying less regard to what concerned human affairs, aimed chiefly at elevation of mind and thought. The ideas and doctrines of the Cabalists seem to have been well known to Milton, and perhaps fuggetted some pallages in Paradise Lost. In Reuchlinus's Exposition of their mysteries there is a curious passage describing the speech of the Deity to the heavenly spirits after the fall of Adam, with the future prospect of redemption by the incarnation of the Messiah, whom the Cabalists recognised in the character of a celestial Adam (b); and, among the books relating to these doctrines, which are said to be lost, mention is made of Liber Bellorum Domini. The mysteries of the Pythagorean philosophy, which, according to Philolaus apud Reuchlinum, sprung from the same source, were also studied and taught with great fervency during this period. Mirandola and Paulus Riccius were the first who explained the Cabalistic mysteries in Latin, and the former, in his Apology, has employed much labour and learning in defending them, as well as the science of natural magic, from the vulgar idea that necromancy was at the bottom of them. His writings, however, upon that subject were few, and we do not know whether they still exist; but it may be collected from the following proposition in his Conclusions, and some others of a similar nature, that he, like all the scholars of his time, had bestowed much attention upon this useless learning:\n\n\"Qui scierit quid sit denarius in Arithmetica formalis, et cognoverit natura primi numeri sph\u00e6rici, sciet secretum quinquaginta portarum intelligentiae et magni jubelaei, et millesimae generationis, et regnum omnium seculorum.\"\n\nThose who are well acquainted with the tenets of the modern millenniums will be able to tell whether there be any connection between them and the allusions in the concluding part of this proposition.\n\nMagic also entered deeply into the learning of this era. This comprises two distinct sciences, that of natural magic, and that of demonology: the first was concerned only in the properties of numbers and figures, and some of the more hidden properties of nature. This knowledge enabled its professors to produce many effects from natural causes, which, when science was less diffused than at present, appeared to be the effect of something superior to the common limits of human power. Albertus, commonly called Magnus, the friend and tutor of Roger Bacon, was the most celebrated of those who excelled in this sort of knowledge. This science has been productive of many admirable discoveries in mathematics and chemistry. Magic, in its common signification, or necromancy, was also eagerly studied at this time, as appears from Cornelius Agrippa's strange work upon that subject; and we may judge of the estimation in which it was held, by the confession that writer makes in his book De vanitate omnium Scientiarum, that while he professed that science, he derived more credit and profit from it, than from any other use he ever could make of his learning. The first matter in this way was said to be Solomon, whose magic ring and glaifs are still famous in eastern demonology.\n\nBut the most dangerous, the most popular, and the most pernicious delusion which the darkness of the preceding ages had entailed upon mankind, was astrology, which will perhaps never be utterly exterminated from the minds of the vulgar, but which then possessed all ranks. When these considerations are taken into the account, it must be looked upon as no despicable application of learning and talents, to have exposed the fallacy and absurdity of this delusion; and when we recollect the great learning and credit of some of its upholders, among whom our countryman Roger Bacon was the most esteemed; the almost universal belief entertained of it, and the few lights which mankind then possessed, as to the real and constant laws obeyed by the celestial bodies; it cannot be denied that the twelve books written by Mirandola against astrology, the effect of which, in opening men's eyes upon that subject is testified by a respectable contemporary author, were the work of a very superior and enlightened mind. When we congratulate ourselves upon our freedom from these superstitions, we ought not to forget, that we owe something to those who gave the first blow to them. Proud of the lights of the age we live in, when astrology and such like cheats are no longer in vogue, we are too apt to overlook the merit of those exertions which first exposed and refuted them; and to persuade ourselves, that in these days of genius and philosophy, such exertions would have been unnecessary; not recollecting that if we enjoy many superiorities of this kind, we are less indebted for them to our own genius than to the labours of those who first paved the way for the detection of superstitious errors; our merit is, that we do not shut our eyes to the light of science; but while we enjoy its blaze, we ought to be grateful to those who struck the first sparks.\n\nJohn Pica of Mirandola has been represented by writers; whose ideas are taken from the encomiums of his contemporaries, as a mighty prodigy of learning and genius. The dilliance which the present times entertain towards those subjects upon which he wrote, renders it very difficult, upon a review of his works, to think those encomiums justified. But making allowance for this change of opinion, and weighing the impartial testimony of his equals, and the early age at which he obtained their admiration, it may be fairly concluded, he was in reality, a man of very extraordinary powers. These memoirs are principally collected from his letters, and the account given of him by his nephew Francisco, himself\n\n(b) Conjicimus fane, alterum esse Adam caelestem angelis in coelo demonstratum, unum ex Deo, quem verbo fecerat, et alterum esse Adam terrenum, repulsum a Deo, quem ex luto manibus suis finxerat.

With this pretence he taught his followers to give themselves up to all impurity; saying that therein consisted the liberty of the sons of God; and that all those not of their sect were in bondage. He first published his notions in Germany and the Low Countries, and persuaded many people to go naked, and gave them the name of Adamites. After this he seized on an island in the river Laufnecz, some leagues from Thabor, the head quarters of Zizka, where he fixed himself and his followers. His women were common, but none were allowed to enjoy them without his permission: so that when any man desired a particular woman, he carried her to Picard, who gave him leave in these words, Go, increase, multiply, and fill the earth.\n\nAt length, however, Zizka, general of the Hussites, (famous for his victories over the emperor Sigismund), hurt at their abominations, marched against them, made himself master of their island, and put them all to death except two; whom he spared, that he might learn their doctrine.\n\nSuch is the account which various writers, relying on the authorities of \u00c6neas Sylvius and Varillas, have given of the Picards, who appear to have been a party of the Vaudois, that fled from persecution in their own country, and sought refuge in Bohemia. It is indeed doubtful whether a sect of this denomination, chargeable with such wild principles and such licentious conduct, ever existed: and it is certainly astonishing that Mr Bayle, in his art, Picards, should adopt the reproachful representations of the writers just mentioned: for it appears probable at least that the whole is a calumny invented and propagated in order to disgrace the Picards, merely because they deserted the communion and protested against the errors of the church of Rome.\n\nLafitius informs us, that Picard, together with 40 other persons, besides women and children, settled in Bohemia in the year 1418. Balbinus the Jesuit, in his Epitome Rerum Bohemicarum, lib. ii. gives a similar account, and charges on the Picards none of the extravagancies or crimes ascribed to them by Sylvius. Schlecta, secretary of Ladislaus, king of Bohemia, in his letters to Erasmus in which he gives a particular account of the Picards, says that they considered the pope, cardinals, and bishops of Rome, as the true Antichrists, and the adorers of the consecrated elements in the eucharist as downright idolaters; that they denied the corporal presence of Christ in this ordinance; that they condemned the worship of saints, prayers for the dead, auricular confession, the penance imposed by priests, the feasts and vigils observed in the Romish church; and that they confined themselves to the observance of the Sabbath, and of the two great feasts of Christmas and Pentecost. From this account, it would appear that they were no other than the Vaudois; and M. de Beaufobre has shown that they were both of the same sect, though under different denominations. Besides, it is certain that the Vaudois\nwere settled in Bohemia in the year 1178, where some of them adopted the rites of the Greek, and others those of the Latin church. The former were pretty generally adhered to till the middle of the 14th century, when the establishment of the Latin rites caused great disturbance. On the commencement of the national troubles in Bohemia, on account of the opposition to the papal power (see Moravians), the Picards more publicly avowed and defended their religious opinions; and they formed a considerable body in an island by the river Launitz or Laufneez, in the district of Bechin, and recurring to arms, were defeated by Zifca.

This province is long and narrow, being usually compared to a bent arm; and in this figure is nearly 150 miles in length, but not above 40 in breadth, and in many places not above 20. It is generally a level country; and produces wine, fruit of all kinds, plenty of corn, and great quantities of hay: but wood being scarce, most of the inhabitants burn turf. They have, however, some pit-coal, but it is not so good as that of England. It was united to the crown of France in the year 1643; and is supposed to contain 533,000 inhabitants.\n\nIts principal rivers are the Somme, the Oise, the Canche, the Lanthie, the Lys, the Aa, the Scarpe, and the Deule.\n\nThe situation of this province on the sea, its many navigable rivers and canals, with the industry of the inhabitants, render it the seat of a flourishing trade. In it are made beautiful silk stuffs, woollen stuffs, coarse linen, lawn, and soap; it also carries on a large trade in corn and pit-coal. In the districts of Calais and Boulogne are annually bred 5000 or 6000 colts, which being afterwards turned loose in the pastures of Normandy, are sold for Norman horses. The fisheries on this coast are also very advantageous. This province was formerly divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Picardy; and again subdivided into four deputy-governments. The principal town is Amiens.","sp":150,"ep":150},{"h":"PICCOLOMINI","t":"Alexander, archbishop of Patras, and a native of Sienna, where he was born about the year 1508, was of an illustrious and ancient family, which came originally from Rome, but afterwards settled at Sienna. He composed with success for the theatre; but he was not more distinguished by his genius, than by the purity of his manners, and his regard to virtue. His charity was very great; and was chiefly exerted in relieving the necessities of men of letters. He has left behind him a number of works in Italian. The most remarkable of which are, 1. Various Dramatic Pieces, which laid the first foundation of his character as a writer. 2. A Treatise on the Sphere. 3. A Theory of the Planets. 4. A Translation of Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric and Poetry, in 4to. 5. A System of Piccolomini Morality, published at Venice, 1575, in 4to; translated into French by Peter de Larivey, in 4to; and printed at Paris, 1581. These, with a variety of other works, prove his extensive knowledge in natural philosophy, mathematics, and theology. He was the first who made use of the Italian language in writing upon philosophical subjects. He died at Sienna the 12th of March 1578, aged 70. A particular catalogue of his works may be seen in the Typographical Dictionary. There is one performance ascribed to this author, entitled Dialogo della bella Creanza delle Donne, (printed at Milan, 1558, and at Venice, 1574, in 8vo.) which but ill suits the dignity of a prelate. It is filled with maxims which have an evident tendency to hurt the morals of young women. Piccolomini's name, indeed, is not in the title page; and it has all the appearance of being a juvenile production. It is very scarce; and the public would sustain no loss by its being entirely out of print. It was translated into French by F. d'Amboise, and published at Lyons, in 16mo, under the title of Instruction des jeunes dames. It was afterwards reprinted in 1583, under that of Dialogue & Devis des Demoiselles.\n\nPiccolomini, Francis, of the same family with the foregoing, was born in 1520, and taught philosophy with success, for the space of 22 years, in the most celebrated universities of Italy, and afterwards retired to Sienna, where he died, in 1624, at the age of 84. This city went into mourning on his death. His works are, 1. Some Commentaries upon Aristotle, printed at Mayence, 1608, in 4to. 2. Universa Philosophia de Moribus, printed at Venice, 1583, in folio. He laboured to revive the doctrine of Plato, and endeavoured also to imitate the manners of that philosopher. He had for his rival the famous James Zabarella, whom he excelled in facility of expression and neatness of discourse; but to whom he was much inferior in point of argument, because he did not examine matters to the bottom as the other did, but prefaced too rapidly from one proposition to another.\n\nPiccolomini of Arragon, Octavius, duke of Amalfi, prince of the Empire, a general of the emperor's army, and knight of the order of the Golden Fleece, was born in 1599. He first bore arms among the Spanish troops in Italy. He afterwards served in the army of Ferdinand II, who sent him to the relief of Bohemia, and entrusted him with the command of the imperial troops in 1634. After having signalized himself at the battle of Norlingue, he made Marshal de Ch\u00e2tillon raise the siege of St Omer. He had the good fortune to gain a victory over Marquis de Feuquieres in 1639; nor did the loss of the battle of Wolfenbuttel, in 1651, impair his glory. He died on the 10th of August 1656, being five years after, aged 57, without issue; and with the character of an able negotiator and an active general. The celebrated Caprara was his nephew.\n\nPiccolomini,\n\n(a) The origin of the name of this province does not date earlier than A.D. 1200. It was an academical joke; an epithet first applied to the quarrelsome humour of those students in the university of Paris who came from the frontier of France and Flanders, and hence to their country Valerii Notitia Galliarum, p. 447. Lorgues, Description de la France, p. 52.\nPiccolomini, James, whose proper name was Ambrosianus, took that of Piccolomini in honour of his patron Pius II. He was born in a village near Lucca in 1422. He became bishop of Massa, afterwards of Frejcati; a cardinal in 1461, under the name of Cardinal de Pavie; and died in 1479, at the age of 57, of an indigestion of figs. He left 8,000 pittoles in the bankers hands, which Pope Sixtus IV claimed; and of which he gave a part to the Hospital of the Holy Ghost. His works, which consist of some Letters, and a history of his own time, were printed at Milan, in 1521, in folio. His history, entitled Commentaries, commences the 18th of June 1464, and ends the 6th of December 1469. They may very properly be considered as a sequel of Pope Pius II's Commentaries, which end with the year 1463.\n\nPiccolomini, Aeneas Sylvius. See Pius II.\n\nPicentia, (Strabo, Pliny), the capital of the Picentini, whose territory, called Ager Picentinus, a small district, lay on the Tuscan sea, from the Promontorium Minervae, the south boundary of Campania on the coast, to the river Silarus, the north boundary of Lucania, extending within land as far as the Samnites and Hirpini, though the exact termination cannot be assigned. The Greeks commonly confound the Picentini with Picentes, but the Romans carefully distinguish them. The former, with no more than two towns that can be named, Silernum and Picentia; the situation of both doubtful: only Pliny says the latter food within land, at some distance from the sea. Now thought to be Bicenza, (Holtenius), in the Principato Citra of Naples.\n\nPicenum, (C\u00e6sar, Pliny, Florus); Picenum Ager, (Cicero, Sallust, Livy, Tacitus); Ager Picentium, (Varro): a territory of Italy, lying to the east of Umbria, from the Apennine to the Adriatic; on the coast extending from the river Aesis on the north, as far as the Picentium to the south. In the upper or northern part of their territory the Umbri excluded them from the Apennine, as far as Camerium, (Strabo); but in the lower or southern part they extended from the Adriatic to the Apennine. A very fruitful territory, and very populous. Picentes, the people, (Cicero); from the singular Picen, (Livy): different from the Picentini on the Tuscan sea, though called so by the Greeks; but Ptolemy calls them Piceni, as does also Pliny. Their territory at this day is supposed to form the greatest part of the March of Ancona, (Cluverius).\n\nPickford, in the county of Salop in England; on the south-east side of Shrewsbury, near Condover. It is noted for a spring of pitchy water (from whence some derive its name), on the top of which there always flows a sort of liquid bitumen. Over most of the coal pits in this neighbourhood there lies a stratum of blackish rock; of which, by boiling and grinding, they make pitch and tar, and also distil an oil from it.\n\nPichincha, or Pinchinca, a mountain in Peru. See Peru, No. 56.\n\nPickering, in the north riding of Yorkshire in England, 13 miles from Scarborough, and 125 from London, is a pretty large town belonging to the duchy of Lancaster, on a hill among the wild mountains of Blakeworth; having the forest of Pickering on the north, and Pickering common on the south. It is said to have been built 270 years before Christ by Peridurus, Pickering, king of the Britons, who was buried here. It had once a castle, the ruins of which are still to be seen; to whose jurisdiction many of the neighbouring villages were subject; and the adjacent territory, commonly called Pickering-Lath, or the liberty or forest of Pickering, was given by Henry III. to his son Edmund earl of Lancaster. A court is kept here for all actions under 40s. arising within the honour of Pickering.\n\nPickery, in Scots Law, petty theft, or stealing things of small value.\n\nPickets, in fortification, flakes sharp at one end, and sometimes shod with iron, used in laying out the ground, of about three feet long; but, when used for pinning the falcons of a battery, they are from three to five feet long.\n\nPickets, in artillery, are about five or six feet long, shod with iron, to pin the park lines, in laying out the boundaries of the park.\n\nPickets, in the camp, are also flakes of about six or eight inches long, to fallen the tent cords, in pitching the tents; also, of about four or five feet long, driven into the ground near the tents of the horsemen, to tie their horses to.\n\nPicket, an out-guard posted before an army, to give notice of an enemy approaching.\n\nPicket, a kind of punishment so called, where a soldier stands with one foot upon a sharp pointed flake; the time of his standing is limited according to the offence.\n\nPickle, a brine or liquor, commonly composed of salt, vinegar, &c., sometimes with the addition of spices, wherein meat, fruit, and other things, are preserved and seasoned.\n\nPico, one of the Azores islands, is so called from some lofty mountains on it; or rather from one very high mountain, terminating like Teneriffe in a peak, and reputed by some writers equal to it in height. This island lies about four leagues south-west from St George, twelve from Terceira, and about three leagues south-east of Fayal; in W. Long. 28\u00b0 21' and N. Lat. 39\u00b0 29'. The mountain Pico, which gives name to the island, is filled with dismal dark caverns or volcanoes, which frequently vomit out flames, smoke, and ashes, to a great distance. At the foot of this mountain towards the east is a spring of fresh water, generally cold, but sometimes heated with the subterraneous fire, as to rush forth in torrents with a kind of ebullition like boiling water; equalling that in heat, and feeding forth a stream of fulminous feld vapours, liquefied stones, minerals, and flakes of earth all on fire, in such quantities, and with such violence, as to have formed a kind of promontory vulgarly called Mysterios, on the declivity of the coast, and at the distance of 1200 paces from the fountain. Such at least is the account of Ortelius; though we do not find this last circumstance of the promontory confirmed by later observations. The circumference of Pico is computed at about 15 leagues: and its most remarkable places are Pico, Lagosas, Santa Cruz or Cruz, San Sebastian, Pequin, San Rocko, Playa, and Magdalena; the inhabitants of which live wholly on the produce of the island, in great plenty and felicity. The cattle are various, numerous, and excellent in their several kinds: it is the same with the vine; and its juice, prepared into different wines, the best in the Azores.\nBesides cedar and other timber, they have a kind of wood which they call teixo, solid and hard as iron; and veined, when finely polished, like a rich scarlet tabby; which colour it has in great perfection. The longer it is kept, the more beautiful it grows: hence it is, that the teixo tree is felled only for the king's use or by his order; and is prohibited from being exported as a common article of trade.\n\nPico Marina, a sea fish common at Kongo in Africa, derives its name from the resemblance of its mouth to the beak of a woodpecker. It is of a large size, and prodigious strength, has four fins on its back, three under its belly, and one on each side of its head; its tail is large and forked, by which it cuts the waves with surprising force and velocity. It is at war with every fish that swims, and with everything it meets in its way, without being intimidated by the largest vessels; a surprising instance of which intrepidity, we are told by some mariners, whose ship was attacked by one of them, near these coasts, in the dead of night. The violence of the shock which it gave to the vessel quickly awakened the captain and the rest of the people; who immediately ran to the ship's side, where they perceived, by moonlight, this huge monster fastened by its forehead to the vessel, and making the strongest efforts to disengage itself; upon which some of them tried to pierce him with their pikes, but he got off before they could accomplish their aim. On the next morning, upon visiting that side of the vessel, they found a piece of the bony snout stuck fast into the wood, and two or three inches of it projecting outwards. In the inside of the ship, there was discovered about five or six inches more of the point of the horn, which had penetrated through the plank. But we must observe, that the credulity of the times probably rendered this animal thus formidable.\n\nPicquering, a flying war, or skirmish, made by foldiers detached from two armies for pillage, or before a main battle begins.\n\nPicquet, or Picquet.

The name is expressive of its sensible qualities.\n\nEvery part of this tree is intensely bitter; and even after the tree has been laid for floors many years, whoever rubs or scrapes the wood, feels a great degree of bitterness in their mouth or throat. Cabinet-work made of this wood is very useful, as no insect will live near it.\n\nThis tree has a great affinity to the Quassia Amara of Linnaeus; in lieu of which it is used as an antiseptic in putrid fevers.

See Botany Index.\n\nPicet, Benedict, a celebrated divine, was born at Geneva, in 1655, of a distinguished family, and prosecuted his studies with great success. After having traveled into Holland and England, he taught theology in his own country with an extraordinary reputation. The university of Leyden, after the death of Spanreina, solicited him to come and fill his place; but he thought that his own country had the best right to his services; and for that generosity he received its thanks by the mouth of the members of council. A languishing disorder, occasioned by too much fatigue, hastened his death: which happened on the 9th of June 1724, at the age of 69 years. This minister had much sweetness and affability in his manner. The poor found in him a comforter and a father. He published a great number of works in Latin and French, which are much esteemed in Protestant countries. The principal of these are,\n\n1. A System of Christian Theology in Latin, 3 vols. in 4to; the best edition of which is that of 1712.\n2. Christian Morality, printed at Geneva, 1710, 8 vols. in 12mo.\n3. The History of the 11th and 12th centuries; intended as a sequel to that of Sueur, printed in 1713, 2 vols. in 4to. The Continuator is held in higher estimation than the first author.\n4. Several Controversial Treatises.\n5. A great number of tracts on morality and piety; among which we must distinguish \"the Art of Living and Dying well;\" published at Geneva, 1725, in 12mo.\n6. Some Letters.\n7. Some Sermons, from 1697 to 1721; 4 vols. in 8vo. With a vast number of other books, the names of which it would be tedious to mention; but which, as Mr Sennebier says, \"all show evident marks of piety and good sense.\"\n\nPicet, John-Louis, a counsellor of Geneva, born in 1739, was of the same family. He was member of the Council of Two Hundred; Counsellor of State and Syndic; and died in 1781. He applied himself to the study of astronomy, and made several voyages into France and England for his improvement. Few men were ever blest with a clearer or more enlightened understanding. He has left in manuscript the \"Journal of a Voyage which he made to Russia and Siberia in 1768 and 1769, in order to observe the transit of Venus over the sun's disk.\" A work very interesting, from the lively descriptions which it gives both of men and of nature.\n\nPictland. See Pentland.\n\nPicts, the name of one of those nations who anciently possessed the north of Britain. It is generally believed that they were so called from their custom of painting their bodies; an opinion which Camden supports with great erudition. (See Gough's edition, Vol. I. p. xci. of the preface). It is certainly liable, however, to considerable objections; for as this custom prevailed among the other ancient inhabitants of Britain, who used the glaifum of Pliny and the virum of Mela for the like purpose, it may be asked, Why the name of Picti was confined by the Romans to only one tribe, when it was equally applicable to many others? Why should they dignify them only by an epithet, without ever annexing their proper name? Or why should they impose a new name on this people only, when they give their proper name to every other tribe which they have occasion to speak of? As these questions cannot be answered in any satisfactory manner, it is plain we must look for some other derivation of the name.\n\nThe Highlanders of Scotland, who speak the ancient language of Caledonia, express the name of this once fa-\nPicts\n\nmous nation by the term Pictish; a name familiar to the ears of the most illiterate, who could never have derived it from the Roman authors. The word Pictish means pilferers or plunderers. The appellation was probably imposed upon this people by their neighbours, or assumed by themselves, some time after the reign of Caracalla, when the ungarded state of the Roman province, on which this people bordered, gave them frequent opportunities of making incursions thither, and committing depredations. Accordingly this name seems to have been unknown till the end of the 3rd century. Eumenius the panegyrist is the first Roman author who mentions this people under their new name of Pictish, or, with a Latin termination, Pisci. When we say that this name may have been probably assumed for the reason just now mentioned, we must observe, that, in those days of violence, the character of a robber was attended with no disgrace. If he had the address to form his schemes well, and to execute them successfully, he was rather praised than blamed for his conduct; providing he made no encroachments on the property of his own tribe or any of its allies. We mean this as no peculiar stigma upon the Picts; for other nations of antiquity, in the like rude state, thought and acted as they did. See Thucydides, lib. iii. p. 3. and Virg. Aen. vii. 745 et 749.\n\nConcerning the origin of the Picts, authors are much divided. Boethius derives them from the Agathyrsi, Pomponius Laetus from the Germans, Bede from the Scythians, Camden (A) and Father Innes from the ancient Britons, Stillingfleet from a people inhabiting the Cimbrica Cheronesus, and Keating and O'Flaherty, on the authority of the Cathol Pfister, derive them from the Thracians. But the most probable opinion is, that they were the descendants of the old Caledonians. Several reasons are urged in support of this opinion by Dr Macpherson; and the words of Eumenes, \"Caledonum, aliorumque Pictorum, filvas,\" &c. plainly imply that the Picts and Caledonians were one and the same people.\n\nAs there has been much dispute about the origin of the Picts, so there has been likewise about their language. There are many reasons which make it plain that their tongue was the Gaelic or Celtic; and these reasons are a further confirmation of their having been of Caledonian extraction. Through the east and north-east coasts of Scotland (which were possessed by the Picts) we meet with an innumerable list of names of places, rivers, mountains, &c., which are manifestly Gaelic. From a very old register of the priory of St Andrew's (Dalrymple's Collections, p. 122.) it appears, that in the days of Hungus, the last Pictish king of that name, St Andrew's was called Mubrofs; and that the town now called Queensferry had the name of Ardochinnachan. Both these words are plain Gaelic. The first signifies \"the heath or promontory of boars;\" and the latter, \"the height or peninsula of Kenneth.\" In the list of Pictish kings published by Father Innes, most of the names are obviously Gaelic, and in many instances the same with the names in the list of Scottish or Caledonian kings published by the same author. Had Innes understood anything of this language, he would not have supposed with Camden that the Picts spoke the British tongue. It was unlucky that the two words on which they built their conjecture (Strath and Aber) are as common in the Gaelic as they could have been in the British, and at this day make a part of the names of places in countries to which the Pictish empire never extended. The names of Strathfillan and Lochaber may serve as instances.\n\nThe venerable Bede, as much a stranger to the Celtic as either of the antiquaries just now mentioned, is equally unhappy in the specimen which he gives of the Pictish language in the word penauhel, \"the head of the wall.\" Allowing the commutation of the initial p into c, as in some other cases, this word has still the same meaning in Gaelic which Bede gives it in the Pictish. It is true, there might have been then, as well as now, a considerable difference between various dialects of the Celtic; and thus, perhaps, that pious author was led to discover five languages in Britain agreeably to the five books of Moses: a contest from which the good man derived a great deal of harmless satisfaction.\n\nThe Picts of the earliest ages, as appears from the Territory, joint testimony of all writers who have examined the subject, possessed only the east and north-east coast of Scotland. On one side, the ancient Drumalbin, or that ridge of mountains reaching from Lochlomond near Dumbarton to the frith of Tain, which separates the county of Sutherland from a part of Ross, was the boundary of the Pictish dominions. Accordingly we find in the life of Columba, that, in travelling to the palace of Bruidis, king of the Picts, he travelled over Drumalbin, the Dorfium Britanniae of Adamnan. On the other side, the territory of the Picts was bounded by the Roman province. After Britain was relinquished by the emperor Honorius, they and the Saxons by turns were masters of those countries which lie between the frith of Edinburgh and the river Tweed. We learn from Bede, that the Saxons were masters of Galloway when he finished his Ecclesiastical History. The Picts, however, made a conquest of that country soon after; so that, before the extinction of their monarchy, all the territories bounded on the one side by the Forth and Clyde, and on the other by the Tweed and Solway, fell into their hands.\n\nThe history of the Picts, as well as of all the other ancient inhabitants of Britain, is involved in obscurity. The Irish historians give us a long list of Pictish kings, who reigned over Pictavia for the space of 11 or 13 centuries before the Christian era. After them Innes, in his Critical Essay, gives us a list of above fifty, of whom no less than five held the sceptre, each for a whole century. It is probable that these writers had confounded the history of the Picts with that of their ancestors the old Caledonians. In any other view, their accounts of them are highly fabulous; and have been long ago confuted by Dr Macpherson of Slate, an antiquary of much learning and research. The Picts, as has been already.\n\n(a) See Gough's edition of Camden, Vol. I. Preface, p. xc. and the Ancient Universal History, Vol. XVII. p. 39, &c.\nPicts already oblerved, were probably not known by that name before the 2d or 3d century. Adamnan, abbot of Iona, is the first author that expressly mentions any Pictish king; and the oldest after him is Bede. We are informed by these two writers, that St Columba converted Brudius king of the Picts to the Christian faith. Columba came into Britain in the year of the vulgar era 565. Before that period we have no general record to ascertain so much as the name of any Pictish king. The history of Druft or Dreft, who is said to have reigned over the Picts in the beginning of the fifth century, when St Ninian first preached the gospel to that nation, has all the appearance of fiction (b). His having reigned a hundred years, and his putting an end to a hundred wars, are stories which exceed all the bounds of probability.\n\nBrudius, the contemporary of Columba, is the first Pictish king mentioned by any writer of authority.\n\nWhat figure his ancestors made, or who were his successors on the throne of Pictavia, cannot be ascertained. Bede informs us, that, during the reign of one of them, the Picts killed Egfred king of Northumberland in battle, and destroyed the greatest part of his army. The same author mentions another of their kings called Naitan, for whom he had a particular regard. It was to this Naitan that Ceolfrid, abbot of Wiremouth, wrote his famous letter concerning Easter and the Tonfure (c); a letter in which Bede himself is supposed to have had a principal hand. Roger Hoveden and Simon of Durham mention two other Pictish kings Onnus and Kinoth, the first of whom died in 761, and the latter flourished about the 774, and gave an asylum to Alfred of Northumberland, who was much about that time expelled his kingdom. The accounts given by the Scots historians of several other Pictish kings cannot be depended on; nor are the stories told by the British historians, Geoffrey of Monmouth and the author of the Eulogium Britanniae, worthy of much greater credit.\n\nIn the ninth century the Pictish nation was totally subdued by the Scots in the reign of Kenneth Macalpin. Since that time their name has been lost in that of the conquerors, with whom they were incorporated after this conquest; however, they seem to have been treated by the Scottish kings with great lenity, so that for some ages after they commanded a great deal of respect. The prior of Hogulthead, an old English historian, relates, that they made a considerable figure in the army of David the Saint, in his disputes with Stephen king of England. In a battle fought in the year 1136, by the English on one side, and the Scots and Picts on the other, the latter insisted on their hereditary right of leading the van of the Scots army, and were indulged in that request by the king,\n\nThe principal seat of the Pictish kings was at Abernethy. Brudius, however, as appears from the accounts given by Adamnan, in his life of Columba, had a palace at Inverness, which was probably near the extremity of his territory in that quarter; for there is no good reason for believing, with Camden, that this king had any property in the Western Isles, or that he had made a gift of Iona to St Columba when he visited him in that place.\n\nWith respect to the manners and customs of the Picts, there is no reason to suppose they were any other than those of the old Caledonians and Scots, of which many particulars are related in the Greek and Roman writers who have occasion to speak of those nations.\n\nUpon the decline of the Roman empire, cohorts of barbarians were raised, and Picts were invited into the service, by Honorius, when peace was everywhere restored, and were named Honoriaei. Those under Constantine opened the passes of the Pyrenean mountains, and let the barbarous nations into Spain. From this period we date the civilization of their manners, which happened after they had by themselves, and then with the Scots, ravaged this Roman province.\n\nPicts Wall, in antiquity, a wall begun by the emperor Adrian, on the northern bounds of England; to prevent the incursions of the Picts and Scots. It was first made only of turf strengthened with palisades, till the emperor Severus, coming into Britain in person, built it with solid stone. This wall, part of which still remains, began at the entrance of the Solway frith in Cumberland, and running north-east extended to the German ocean.

Those objects are most properly denominated picturesque, which are disposed by the hand of nature with a mixture of varied rudeness, simplicity, and grandeur. A plain neat garden, with little variation in its plan, and no striking grandeur in its position, displays too much of art, design, and uniformity, to be called picturesque. \"The ideas of neat and smooth (says Mr Gilpin), instead of being picturesque, in fact disqualify the object in which they reside from any pretensions to picturesque beauty. Nay, farther, we do not scruple to assert, that roughness forms the most essential point of difference between the beautiful and the picturesque; as it seems to be that particular quality which makes\n\n(b) According to Camden, this conversion happened about the year 630, in the southern Pictish provinces; while the northern, which were separated by fruitful mountains, were converted by Columba.\n\n(c) We are told by some authors that Columba taught the Picts to celebrate Easter always on a Sunday between the 14th and 20th of March, and to observe a different method of tonsure from the Romans, leaving an imperfect appearance of a crown. This occasioned much dispute till Naitan brought his subjects at length to the Roman rule. In that age many of the Picts went on a pilgrimage to Rome, according to the custom of the times; and amongst the rest we find two persons mentioned in the antiquities of St Peter's church. Aelverius count of the Picts, and Syra with his countrymen, performed their vow.\nP H I\n\nPictorial makes objects chiefly pleasing in painting. I use the general term roughness; but properly speaking roughness relates only to the surfaces of bodies: when we speak of their delineation, we use the word ruggedness. Both ideas, however, equally enter into the picturesque, and both are observable in the smaller as well as in the larger parts of nature; in the outline and bark of a tree, as in the rude summit and craggy sides of a mountain.\n\nLet us then examine our theory by an appeal to experience, and try how far these qualities enter into the idea of picturesque beauty, and how far they mark that difference among objects which is the ground of our inquiry.\n\n\"A piece of Palladian architecture may be elegant in the last degree; the proportion of its parts, the propriety of its ornaments, and the symmetry of the whole, may be highly pleasing; but if we introduce it in a picture, it immediately becomes a formal object, and ceases to please. Should we wish to give it picturesque beauty, we must use the mallet instead of the chisel; we must beat down one half of it, deface the other, and throw the mutilated members around in heaps; in short, from a smooth building we must turn it into a rough ruin. No painter who had the choice of the two objects would hesitate a moment.\n\n\"Again, why does an elegant piece of garden-ground make no figure on canvas? The shape is pleasing, the combination of the objects harmonious, and the winding of the walk in the very line of beauty. All this is true; but the smoothness of the whole, though right and as it should be in nature, offends in picture. Turn the lawn into a piece of broken ground, plant rugged oaks instead of flowering shrubs, break the edges of the walk, give it the rudeness of a road, mark it with wheel tracks, and scatter around a few stones and brushwood; in a word, instead of making the whole smooth, make it rough, and you make it also picturesque. All the other ingredients of beauty it already possesses.\" On the whole, picturesque composition consists in uniting in one whole, a variety of parts, and these parts can only be obtained from rough objects.\n\nIt is possible, therefore, to find picturesque objects among works of art, and it is possible to make objects so; but the grand scene of picturesque beauty is nature in all its original variety, and in all its irregular grandeur. \"We seek it (says our author) among all the ingredients of landscape, trees, rocks, broken grounds, woods, rivers, lakes, plains, valleys, mountains, and distances. These objects in themselves produce infinite variety; no two rocks or trees are exactly the same; they are varied a second time by combination; and almost as much a third time by different lights and shades and other aerial effects. Sometimes we find among them the exhibition of a whole, but oftener we find only beautiful parts.\"\n\nSublimity or grandeur alone cannot make an object picturesque: for, as our author remarks, \"however grand the mountain or the rocks may be, it has no claim to this epithet, unless its form, its colour, or its accompaniments, have some degree of beauty. Nothing can be more sublime than the ocean; but wholly unaccompanied, it has little of the picturesque. When we talk therefore of a sublime object, we always understand that it is also beautiful; and we call it sublime or beautiful only as the ideas of sublimity or simple beauty prevail. But it is not only the form and the composition of the objects of landscape which the picturesque eye examines; it connects them with the atmosphere, and feels for all those various effects which are produced from that vast and wonderful storehouse of nature. Nor is there in travelling a greater pleasure than when a scene of grandeur bursts unexpectedly upon the eye, accompanied with some accidental circumstance of the atmosphere which harmonizes with it, and gives it double value.\"\n\nThere are few places so barren as to afford no picturesque scene.\n\nBelieve the muse,\nShe does not know that insipidious spot\nWhere beauty is thus niggard of her store.\nBelieve the muse, through this terrestrial waste\nThe seeds of grace are sown, profusely sown,\nEven where we least may hope.\n\nMr Gilpin mentions the great military road between Newcastle and Carlisle as the most barren tract of country in England; and yet there, he says, there is \"always something to amuse the eye. The interchangeable patches of heath and green-ward make an agreeable variety. Often too on these vast tracts of intersecting grounds we see beautiful lights, softening off along the sides of hills; and often we see them adorned with cattle, flocks of sheep, heath-cocks, grouse, plover, and flights of other wild fowl. A group of cattle standing in the shade on the edge of a dark hill, and relieved by a lighter distance beyond them, will often make a complete picture without any other accompaniment. In many other situations also we find them wonderfully pleasing, and capable of making pictures amidst all the deficiencies of landscape. Even a winding road itself is an object of beauty; while the richness of the heath on each side, with the little hillocks and crumbling earth, give many an excellent lesson for a foreground. When we have no opportunity of examining the grand scenery of nature, we have everywhere at least the means of observing with what a multiplicity of parts, and yet with what general simplicity, she covers every surface.\n\n\"But if we let the imagination loose, even scenes like these administer great amusement. The imagination can plant hills; can form rivers and lakes in valleys; can build castles and abbeys; and, if it find no other amusement, can dilate itself in vast ideas of space.\"\n\nMr Gilpin, after describing such objects as may be called picturesque, proceeds to consider their sources of amusement. We cannot follow our ingenious author through the whole of this consideration, and shall therefore finish our article with a short quotation from the beginning of it. \"We might begin (says he) in moral style, and consider the objects of nature in a higher light than merely as amusement. We might observe, that a search after beauty should naturally lead the mind to the great origin of all beauty; to the first good, first perfect, and first fair.\n\nBut though in theory this seems a natural climax, we infall the less upon it, as in fact we have scarce ground to hope that every admirer of picturesque beauty is an admirer.\nPIE\n\nPicturcous admirer also of the beauty of virtue; and that every lover of nature reflects, that Beauty is but a name for an effect,\n\nWhole cayce is God.\n\nIf, however, the admirer of nature can turn his amusements to a higher purpose; if its great scenes can inspire him with religious awe, or its tranquil scenes with that complacency of mind which is so nearly allied that benevolence, it is certainly the better. Apponat lucro. It is so much into the bargain; for we dare not promise him more from picturesque travel than a rational and agreeable amusement.

It is called Piedmont, and in Latin Piedmontium, from its situation at the foot of the mountains, or Alps, which separate France from Italy. This country is in some parts mountainous, but is everywhere very fruitful. The plains produce fine corn, and Montferrat and the Milanese yield great quantities of Turkey wheat, which commonly serves for bread, and with which the people of the middle rank mix rye; the pods are used for fuel, and the stalks being thick serve to mend the roads. The hills produce plenty of wine, which, like the Italian wines, is very delicious when new, especially the white. There is also a tartish red wine called vino brufco, said to be very wholesome for fat people, and, on the other hand, the sweet wine is recommended as a stomachic. The neighbourhood of Turin is famous for its fine fruits, and many long walks of chestnut and mulberry trees, which produce both pleasure and profit. Marons, or large chestnuts, are a favourite dainty among the common people. They are put into an oven, and, when thoroughly hot, and cooled in red wine, are dried a second time in the oven, and afterwards eaten cold. Truffles grow here in such abundance, that Piedmont has obtained the name of the truffle country. Some are black, others white marbled with red. Their price is rated according to their size. Sometimes they are found of 12 or 14 pounds weight; and many country people earn from 60 to 70 dollars a-year merely by digging for them. The trade in cattle is said to bring into Piedmont no less than three millions of livres per annum. The cultivation of silk is also a profitable article, the Piedmontese silk being, on account of its fineness and strength, esteemed the best in Italy. The Piedmontese gentry breed vast numbers of silk-worms under the care of their tenants, who have the eggs and mulberry leaves delivered to them, and in return they give half the silk to their masters. This principality comprehends eleven small provinces: Piedmont proper, the valleys between France and Italy, the valley of Saluzza, the county of Nice, the marquisate of Sula, the duchy of Ao\u00ebt, the Canavese, the lordship of Vettai,\nPiedmont, fail, the county of Aft, and the Langes. It was formerly a part of Lombardy, but now belongs to the king of Sardinia, and lies at the foot of the Alps, which separate France from Italy. It contains many high mountains, among which there are rich and fruitful valleys, as pleasant and populous as any part of Italy. In the mountains are mines of several kinds, and the forests afford a great deal of curious game, among which the tumor is an useful animal. \"The mules (says Mr Watkins) are very fine in this country; but the inhabitants have other beasts, or rather monsters which they find very serviceable, though vicious and obstinate. These are produced by a cow and an ass, or mare and bull, and called jumarres or gimerri (A). I cannot say that I have ever seen any of them, but I am told they are very common.\"\n\nThe Piedmontese are said to be more intelligent than the Savoyards, but less sincere. Some authors represent them as lively, artful, and witty, the inhabitants of the mountain of Aoita excepted, who are farther distinguished by large wens, as even their horses, dogs, and other animals. Mr Baretti, however, in his Account of Italy, vol. ii. p. 116, gives the following account of them. \"One of the chief qualities (says he), which distinguish the Piedmontese from all other Italians, is their want of cheerfulness. Piedmont never produced a single good poet, as far as the records of the country can go, whereas there is no other province of Italy but what can boast of some poet ancient or modern; and yet the Piedmontese are not deficient in several branches of learning, and some of them have succeeded tolerably well in civil law, physic, and the mathematics. It is likewise observed of this people, that none of them ever attained to any degree of excellence in the polite arts, and it is but lately that they can boast of a painter, Cavaliere Bontempe; a flautist, Signor Lodetto; and some architects, Conte Alferi, Signor Borra, and others, who yet, to say the truth, are far inferior to numberless artists produced by the other provinces of Italy. They have, on the other hand, greatly advanced when considered as soldiers; though their troops have never been very numerous, every body conversant in history knows the brave land they made for some centuries past against the French, Spaniards, and Germans, whenever they have been invaded by these nations. The skill of the Piedmontese in fortification is likewise very great, and their Bertolas and Pintos have shown as much genius as the Vaubans and Cohorns, in rendering impregnable several places which inferior engineers would only have made secure.\"\n\nThe chief trade of this principality consists in hemp and silk. Indeed, so great is their trade in raw silk, that the English alone have purchased to the value of 200,000 lib. in a year. The silk worm thrives so well, that many peasants make above (B) 100 lib. of silk annually; and it is not only abundant, but universally known to be stronger and finer than any in Italy. The land owners divide the profit with their tenants. The Piedmontese workmen, however, are said to want experience, though they finish their work equally well with those of other nations. The high duty and land carriage on mules likewise tend to lessen the value of this trade. They have besides corn, rice, wine, fruits, flax, and cattle.\n\nIn the valleys of Lucerne, Peyrouse, and St Martin, which have always belonged to Piedmont, live the celebrated Waldenses or Vaudois, a name which signifies people of the valleys. These have rendered themselves famous in history for their dissent from the Roman church long before the time of Luther and Calvin, and for the persecutions they have suffered on that account; but since the year 1730 they have not been openly molested for their religion, but, in order to suppress them by degrees, a papal church has been built in every parish. They are heavily taxed, and labour under great oppressions. The number of people in these valleys scarce at present exceeds 15,000, of which 1000 are Catholics. The chief river of Piedmont is the Po, which flows out of Mount Vilo. The river Sesia, the Doria, Baltea, the ancient Drunta, the Tenaro, and several others, run into it. The Var, anciently called the Varus, rises in the county of Nice, and after watering it empties itself into the Mediterranean. The language of the Piedmontese is a mixture of French and Italian. In this country are about 50 earldoms, 15 marquises, a multitude of lordships, and 20 abbeys. Though the country be entirely popish, except some valleys inhabited by the Waldenses, the king reserves to himself the greatest part of the power in church affairs, which in many other places is given up to the pope, and the constitution unigenitus is here universally opposed. Towards the end of the 17th century, the French king persuaded the duke of Savoy to drive them out of the country; in consequence of which 200,000 of them retired to Germany, England, and Holland, and yet they are not all extirpated, though, as we have observed, they are obliged to have a Roman Catholic church in every parish.\n\nTurin, formerly the residence of the king of Sardinia, to whom this principality belonged, is the chief city. See Turin. The number of inhabitants, Mr Watkins says, in Piedmont and Savoy, amount to 2,695,727 souls, of which Turin contains about 77,000.

He studied anatomy with the sciences necessary for his profession; and had somewhat of everything that was good in his compositions. After Raphael's death, he joined with Julio Romano and Francisco Penni to finish the works in the Vatican, which were left imperfect by their common master; and to confirm their friendship married Penni's sister. He gained the highest reputation by his performances in the palace of Prince Doria at Genoa; but the multiplicity of his business, and the vivacity of his imagination, drained his spirits in the flower of his age; for he died in the year 1547. Of all Raphael's disciples, Pierino kept the character of his master longest, i.e., his exterior character and manner of designing; for he fell very short of the fineness of Raphael's thinking. He had a particular genius for the decoration of places according to their customs. His invention in that kind of painting was full of ingenuity; grace and order are everywhere to be met with, and his dispositions, which are ordinary in his pictures, are wonderful in his ornaments: some of these he has made little, and some great, and placed them both with so much art, that they set off one another by comparison and contrast. His figures are disposed and designed according to Raphael's gusto; and if Raphael gave him at first some slight sketches of ornaments, as he did to Giovanni d'Udine, he executed them to admiration.

Many imagine it had its name of the autumn-stone from its being only to be made at that season of the year; but it may certainly be made equally at all times. The Chinese chemists refer the various parts of the body to the several seasons of the year, and thus they refer the lungs to autumn. This is evident in their writings, and thus the stone for dilutes of the lungs came to be called autumn-stone. It is prepared as follows: They put 30 pints of the urine of a strong and healthy young man into a large iron pot, and let it over a gentle fire. When it begins to boil, they add to it, drop by drop, about a large tea-cup-full of rape oil. They then leave it on the fire till the whole is evaporated to a thick substance like black mud. It is then taken out of the pot,\nand laid on a flat iron to dry, so that it may be powdered very fine. This powder is moistened with fresh oil, and the mass is put into a double crucible, surrounded with coals, where it stands till it be thoroughly dried again. This is again powdered, and put into a china veffel, which being covered with silk cloth and a double paper, they pour on it boiling water, which makes its way, drop by drop, through these coverings, till so much is got in as is sufficient to reduce it to a paste. This paste is well mixed together in the veffel it is kept in, and this is put into a veffel of water, and the whole set over the fire.

The town extends along the shore, and a battery that commands the road is erected on the west side, which is washed by the river Royolan, or St Peter. The town is divided into three wards; the middle, which is properly St Peter's, begins at the fort, and runs westward to the battery of St Nicholas. Under the walls of the second ward ships at anchor ride more securely than under the fort, on which account this ward is called the Anchorage.

This distinguished virtue, like many others, received among the Romans divine honours, and was made one of their gods. Acilius Glabrio first erected a temple to this divinity, which he did upon the spot on which a woman had fed with her own milk her aged father, who had been imprisoned by order of the senate, and deprived of all aliments. The story is well known, and is given at length in authors which are in the hands of every schoolboy. See Cicero de div. i. and Valerius Maximus, v. c. 4. and our article FILLAL Piety.\n\nIf piety was thus practised and thus honoured in Heathen antiquity, it surely ought not to be less so, among Christians, to whom its nature is better defined, and to the practice of which they have motives of greater cogency. A learned and elegant writer has said that the want of piety arises from the want of sensibility; and his observations and arguments are so just and so well expressed, that we cannot do better than transcribe them.\n\n\"It appears to me (says Dr Knox), that the mind of man, when it is free from natural defects and acquired corruption, feels no less a tendency to the indulgence of devotion than to virtuous love, or to any other of the more refined and elevated affections. But debauchery and excess contribute greatly to destroy all the susceptible delicacy with which nature usually furnishes the heart; and, in the general extinction of our better qualities, it is no wonder that so pure a sentiment as that of piety should be one of the first to expire.\n\n\"It is certain that the understanding may be improved in a knowledge of the world, and in the arts of succeeding in it, while the heart, or whatever constitutes the seat of the moral and sentimental feelings, is gradually receding from its proper and original perfection. Indeed experience seems to evince, that it is hardly possible to arrive at the character of a complete man of the world, without losing many of the most valuable sentiments of uncorrupted nature. A complete man of the world is an artificial being; he has discarded many of the native and laudable tendencies of his mind, and adopted a new system of objects and propensities of his own creation. These are commonly gross, coarse, lordly, selfish, and sensual. All, or either of these attributes, tend directly to blunt the senses of every thing liberal, enlarged, disinterested; of every thing which participates more of an intellectual than of a sensual nature. When the heart is tied down to the earth by lust and avarice, it is not extraordinary that the eye should be\nPietv. seldom lifted up to heaven. To the man who spends his Sunday (because he thinks the day fit for little else) in the counting-house, in travelling, in the tavern, or in the brothel, those who go to church appear as fools, and the busines they go upon as nonsense. He is callous to the feelings of devotion; but he is tremblingly alive to all that gratifies his senses or promotes his interests.\n\n\"It has been remarked of those writers who have attacked Christianity, and represented all religions merely as diversified modes of superstition, that they were indeed, for the most part, men of a metaphysical and a disputatious turn of mind, but usually little distinguished for benignity and generosity. There was, amidst all their pretensions to logical sagacity, a cloudiness of ideas, and a coldness of heart, which rendered them very unfit judges on a question in which the heart is chiefly interested; in which the language of nature is more expressive and convincing, than all the dreary subtleties of the dismal metaphysicians. Even the reasoning faculty, on which we so greatly value ourselves, may be perverted by excessive refinement; and there is an abstruse, but vain and foolish philosophy, which philosophizes us out of the noblest parts of our noble nature.\n\nOne of those parts of us is our instinctive sense of religion, of which not one of those brutes which the philosophers most admire, and to whose rank they wish to reduce us, is found in the slightest degree to participate.\n\n\"Such philosophers may be called, in a double sense, the enemies of mankind. They not only endeavour to entice man from his duty, but to rob him of a most excellent and natural pleasure. Such, surely, is the pleasure of devotion. For when the soul rises above this little orb, and pours its adoration at the throne of celestial majesty, the holy fervour which it feels is itself a rapturous delight. Neither is this a declamatory representation, but a truth felt and acknowledged by all the sons of men; except those who have been defective in sensibility, or who hoped to gratify the pride or the malignity of their hearts by singular and pernicious speculation.\n\n\"Indeed all disputatious, controversial, and metaphysical writings on the subject of religion, are unfavourable to genuine piety. We do not find that the most renowned polemics in the church militant were at all more attentive than others to the common offices of religion, or that they were actuated by any peculiar degree of devotion. The truth is, their religion centered in their heads, whereas its natural region is the heart. The heart! confined, alas! in colleges or libraries, unacquainted with all the tender charities of husband, father, brother, friend; some of them have almost forgotten that they possess a heart. It has long ceased to beat with the pulsations of love and sympathy, and has been engrossed by pride on conquering an adversary in the syllogistic combat, or by impotent anger on a defeat. With such habits, and so defective a system of feelings, can we expect that a doctor of the Sorbonne, or the disputing professor of divinity, should ever feel the pure flame of piety that glowed in the bosoms of Mrs Rowe, Mrs Talbot, or Mr Nellon?\n\n\"It is however certain, that a devotional taste and habit are very desirable in themselves, exclusive of their effects in meliorating the morals and disposition, and promoting present and future felicity. They add dignity, pleasure, and security to any age: but to old age they are the most becoming grace, the most substantial support, and the sweetest comfort. In order to preserve them, it will be necessary to preserve our sensibility; and nothing will contribute so much to this purpose as a life of temperance, innocence, and simplicity.\"\n\nOf piety, as it denotes love and tenderness to our friends, there have been many distinguished instances both in ancient and modern times. See FILIAL Piety, FRATERNAL and PARENTAL Affection, &c.\n\nThe following example of filial piety in China, taken from P. Du Halde's description of that country, will not we trust be disagreeable to our readers. \"In the commencement of the dynasty of the Tang, Lou-tao-tsong, who was disaffected to the government, being accused of a fault, which touched his life, obtained leave from those who had him in custody, to perform the duties of the Tao to one of his deceased friends. He managed matters so well, that giving his keepers the slip, he fled to the house of Lou Nan-kin, with whom he had a friendship, and there hid himself. Lou Nan-kin, notwithstanding the strict search that was made, and the severity of the court against those who conceal prisoners that have escaped, would not betray his friend. However, the thing coming to be discovered, Lou Nan-kin was imprisoned; and they were just on the point of proceeding against him, when his younger brother presenting himself before the judge, It is I, Sir, said he, who have hidden the prisoner; it is I who ought to die, and not my elder brother. The eldest maintained, on the contrary, that his younger brother accused himself wrongfully, and was not at all culpable. The judge, who was a person of great sagacity, fitted both parties to effectually, that he not only discovered that the younger brother was innocent, but even made him confess it himself: It is true, Sir, said the younger all in tears, I have accused myself falsely; but I have very strong reasons for so doing. My mother has been dead for some time, and her corpse is not yet buried; I have a sister also who is marriageable, but is not yet disposed of: these things which my brother is capable of managing, I am not, and therefore desire to die in his stead.

When persons shoot at or kill pigeons within a certain distance of the pigeon-house, they are liable to pay a forfeiture.\n\nIn order to erect a pigeon-house to advantage, it will be necessary, in the first place, to pitch upon a convenient situation; of which none is more proper than the middle of a spacious court-yard, because pigeons are naturally of a timorous disposition, and the least noise they hear frightens them. With regard to the size of the pigeon-house, it must depend entirely upon the number of birds intended to be kept; but it is better to have it too large than too little; and as to its form, the round should be preferred to the square ones; because rats cannot so easily come at them in the former as in the latter. It is also much more commodious; because you may, by means of a ladder turning upon an axis, easily visit all the nests in the house, without the least difficulty; which cannot so easily be done in a square house. In order to hinder rats from climbing up the outside of the pigeon-house, the wall should be covered with tin plates to a certain height, about a foot and a half will be sufficient; but they should project out three or four inches at the top, to prevent their clambering any higher.\n\nThe pigeon-house should be placed at no great distance from water, that the pigeons may carry it to their young ones; and their carrying it in their bills will warm it, and render it more wholesome in cold weather. The boards that cover the pigeon-house should be well joined together, so that no rain may penetrate through it; and the whole building should be covered with hard plaster, and white-washed within and without, white being the most pleasing colour to pigeons. There must be no window, or other opening in the pigeon-house to the eastward; these should always face the south, for pigeons are very fond of the sun, especially in winter.\n\nThe nests or covers in a pigeon-house should consist of square holes made in the walls, of a size sufficient to admit the cock and hen to stand in them. The first range of these nests should not be less than four feet from the ground, that the wall underneath being smooth, the rats may not be able to reach them. These nests should be placed in quincunx order, and not directly over one another. Nor must they be continued any higher than within three feet of the top of the wall; and the upper row should be covered with a board, projecting a considerable distance from the wall, for fear the rats should find means to climb the outside of the house.\n\nM. Duhamel thinks that pigeons neither feed upon the green corn, nor have bills strong enough to search for its seeds in the earth; but only pick up the grains that are not covered, which would infallibly become the prey of other animals, or be dried up by the sun. \"From the time of the sprouting of the corn,\" says he, \"pigeons live chiefly upon the seeds of wild uncultivated plants, and therefore lessen considerably the quantity of weeds that would otherwise spring up; as will appear from a just estimate of the quantity of grain necessary to feed all the pigeons of a well-stocked dove-house.\" But Mr Worlidge and Mr Litle allege facts in support of the contrary opinion. The latter relates, that a farmer in his neighbourhood assured him he had known an acre sown with peas, and rain coming on so that they could not be harrowed in, every pea was fetched away in half a day's time by pigeons; and the former says, \"It is to be observed, that where the flight of pigeons falls, there they fill themselves and away, and return again where they first rose, and so proceed over a whole piece of ground, if they like it. Although you cannot perceive any grain above the ground, they know how to find it. I have seen them lie so much upon a piece of about two or three acres sown with peas, that they devoured at least three parts in four of the seed, which, I am sure, could not be all above the surface of the ground. That their smelling is their principal director, I have observed; having sown a small plot of peas in my garden, near a pigeon-house, and covered them so well that not a pea appeared above ground. In a few days, a parcel of pigeons were hard at work in discovering this hidden treasure; and in a few days more I had not above two or three peas left out of about two quarts that were planted; for what they could not find before, they found when the buds appeared, notwithstanding they were hoed in, and well covered. Their smelling alone directed them, as I supposed, because they followed the ranges exactly. The injury they do at harvest on the peas, vetches, &c. is such that we may rank them among the greatest enemies the poor husbandman meets withal; and the greater, because he may not erect a pigeon-house, whereby to have a share of his own spoils; none but the rich being allowed this privilege, and so severe a law being also made to protect these winged thieves, that a man cannot encounter them, even in defence of his own property. You have therefore no remedy against them, but to affright them away by noises or such like. You may, indeed, shoot at them; but you must not kill them; or you may, if you can, take them in a net, cut off their tails, and let them go; by which means you will impound them; for when they are in their houses, they cannot bolt or fly out of the tops of them, but by the strength of their tails; after thus weakening of which, they remain prisoners at home.\"\n\nMr Worlidge's impounding the pigeons reminds us of a humorous story of a gentleman, who, upon a neighbouring farmer's complaining to him, that his pigeons were a great nuisance to his land, and did sad mischief to his corn, replied jokingly, \"Pound them, if you catch them trespassing.\" The farmer, improving the hint, steeped a parcel of peas in an infusion of coccinellus indicus, or some other intoxicating drug, and strewed them upon his grounds. The pigeons swallowed them, and soon remained motionless on the field: upon which the farmer threw a net over them, inclosed them in it, and carried\nried them to an empty barn, from whence he sent the gentleman word that he had followed his directions with regard to the pounding of his pigeons, and desired him to come and release them.\n\nCarrier-Pigeon. See Carrier-Pigeon and Columba, Ornithology Index.\n\nPigeon, Peter Charles Francis, curate of St Peter du Regard, in the diocese of Bayeux, was one of the priests lately belonging to the king's house at Winchester. He was born in Lower Normandy, of honest and virtuous parents, and of a decent fortune. His inclinations early led him to embrace the ecclesiastical state, from which neither the solicitations of his friends, nor the prospect of a more ample fortune on the death of his elder brother, could withdraw him. Several of his schoolfellows and masters, who are now resident in the king's house at Winchester, bear the most ample testimony to his affability, regularity, piety, and the sweetness of his disposition, during the whole course of his education. The sweetness of temper, in particular, was so remarkable, and so clearly depicted on his countenance, as to have gained him the esteem and affection of such of the inhabitants of Winchester as by any means had become acquainted with him. He was seven years employed in quality of vicar, or, as we should call it, curate, of a large parish in the diocese of Seze, where his virtues and talents had ample scope for exertion. His practice was to rise at five o'clock every morning, and to spend the whole time till noon (the usual time of dinner for persons in his station) in prayer and study. The rest of the day, till evening, he devoted to visiting the sick, and other exterior duties of his function. In 1789, the year of the French revolution, M. Pigeon was promoted to a curacy, or rather a rectory, in the diocese of Bayeux, called the parish of St Peter du Regard, near the town of Cond\u00e9 sur No\u00ebre. It was easy for him to gain the good-will and the protection of his parishioners; but a Jacobin club in the above-mentioned town seemed to have no other subject to deliberate upon than the various ways of harassing and persecuting M. Pigeon and certain other priests in the neighbourhood, who had from motives of conscience refused the famous civic oath. It would be tedious to relate the many cruelties which were at different times exercised upon him, and the imminent danger of losing his life to which he was exposed, by the blows that were inflicted on him, by his being thrown into water, and being obliged to wander in woods and other solitary places, without any food or place to lay his head, in order to avoid his persecutors. We may form some judgement of the spirit of his persecutors from the following circumstance. Being disappointed on a particular occasion in the search they were making after M. Pigeon, with the view of amusing themselves with his sufferings, they made themselves amends by seizing his mother, a respectable lady of 74 years of age, and his two sisters, whom they placed upon asses with their faces turned backwards, obliging them in derision to hold the tails of these animals. Thus they were conducted in pain and ignominy throughout the whole town of Cond\u00e9, for no other alleged crime except being the nearest relations of M. Pigeon. At length the decree for transporting all the ecclesiastics arrived; and this gentleman, with several others, after having been stripped of all their money, was shipped from Port Belfin, and landed at Portsmouth, where he was shortly after received into the establishment at Foxton, and, upon that being dissolved in order to make room for prisoners of war, into the king's house at Winchester. Being of a studious turn, he was accustomed, as many of his brethren also were, to betake himself to the neighbouring lanes and thickets for the sake of greater solitude. With this view having, about ten o'clock in the morning, Aug. 28, 1793, retired to a certain little valley, on the north-east side of a place called Oram's Arbour, the same place where the county elections for Hampshire are held, he was there found, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, murdered, with the upper part of his skull absolutely broken from the lower part, and a large hedge-stake, covered with blood, lying by him, as were the papers on which he had been transcribing a manuscript sermon, with the hearing of which he had been much edified, and the sermon itself which he was copying, together with his pen, imbrued in blood. His watch was carried away, though part of the chain, which had by some means been broken, was left behind. He was writing the word paradise, the last letters of which remained unwritten when the fatal blow was given him, which appears evidently to have been discharged upon him from a gap in a hedge which was immediately behind him. At first the suspicion of this cruel murder fell upon the French democrats, who, to the number of 200, are prisoners of war, at the neighbouring town of Alresford, as one of that number, who had broken his parole, had, about three weeks before, been taken up in Winchester, and both there and at Alresford had repeatedly threatened to murder his uncle, a priest, whom he understood to be then at Winchester, not without fervent wishes of having it in his power to murder the whole establishment, consisting of more than 600 persons. However, as no French prisoner was seen that day in the neighbourhood of Winchester, as none of them were known to have left Alresford, it is evidently reasonable to acquiesce in the verdict of the coroner; namely, that the murder was committed by a person or persons unknown. The most noble marquis of Buckingham, whose munificence and kindness to those conscientious exiles, the emigrant French clergy, can only be conceived by those who have been witnesses of the same, with the truly respectable corps of the Buckinghamshire militia, then quartered at Winchester, joined in paying the last mark of respect to the unfortunate deceased, by attending his funeral, which was performed at the Roman Catholic burying-ground, called St James's, near the said city, on Saturday, Aug. 29. He was just 38 years of age when he was murdered.","sp":160,"ep":162},{"h":"PIGMENTS","t":"preparations used by painters, dyers, &c., to impart colours to bodies, or to imitate particular colours.

At Rycoot in Oxfordshire, in the year 1749, in a moat surrounding the earl of Abingdon's seat, there was a jack or pike of such a monstrous size, that it had destroyed young swans feathers and all. An old cobb swan having hatched five young, one after another was lost till four were gone. At length an under gardener saw the fish seize the fifth. The old one fought him with their beaks, and with the assistance of the gardener, released it although he had got it under water. In the year 1765 a large pike was caught in the river Ouse, which weighed upwards of 28 pounds, and was sold for a guinea. On gutting the fish, a watch with a black ribbon and two steel seals were found in its stomach, which, by the maker's name, &c. was found to belong to a person who had been drowned about six weeks before. This fish breeds but once in a year, which is in March. It is found in almost all fresh waters; but is very different in goodness, according to the nature of the places where it lives. The finest pike are those which feed in clear rivers; those in ponds and meres are inferior, and the worst of all are those of the fen ditches. They are very plentiful in these last places, where the water is foul and coloured, and their food, such as frogs and the like, very plentiful, but very coarse; so that they grow large, but are yellowish and high bellied, and differ greatly from those which live in the clearer waters.\n\nThe fishermen have two principal ways of catching the pike; by the ledger, and by the walking-bait.\n\nThe ledger-bait is fixed in one certain place, and may continue while the angler is absent. This must be a live bait, a fish or frog; and among fish, the dace, roach, and gudgeon, are the best; of frogs, the only caution is to choose the largest and yellowest that can be met with. If the bait be a fish, the hook is to be stuck through the upper lip, and the line must be 14 yards at least in length; the other end of this is to be tied to a bough of a tree, or to a stick driven into the ground near the pike's haunt, and all the line wound round a forked stick, except about half a yard. The bait will by this means keep playing so much under water, and the pike will soon lay hold of it.\n\nIf the bait be a frog, then the arming wire of the hook should be put in at the mouth, and out at the side; and with a needle and some strong silk, the hinder leg of one side is to be fastened by one flitch to the wire-arming of the hook. The pike will soon seize this, and must have line enough to give him leave to get to his haunt, and poach the bait.\n\nThe trolling for pike is a pleasant method also of taking them: in this a dead bait serves, and none is so proper as a gudgeon.\n\nThis is to be pulled about in the water till the pike seizes it; and then it is to have line enough, and time to swallow it: the hook is small for this sport, and has a smooth piece of lead fixed at its end to sink the bait; and the line is very long, and runs through a ring at the end of the rod, which must not be too slender at top.\n\nThe art of feeding pike, so as to make them very fat, is the giving them eels; and without this it is not to be done under a very long time; otherwise perch, while small, and their prickly fins tender, are the best food for them. Bream put into a pike-pond are a very proper food: they will breed freely, and their young ones make excellent food for the pike, who will take care that they shall not increase over much. The numerous shoals of roaches and rudds, which are continually changing place, and often in floods get into the pike's quarters, are food for them for a long time.\n\nPike, when used to be fed by hand, will come up to the very shore, and take the food that is given them out of the fingers of the feeder. It is wonderful to see with what courage they will do this, after a while practising; and it is a very diverting fight when there are several of them nearly of the same size, to see what striving and fighting there will be for the best bits when they are thrown in. The most convenient place is near the mouth of the pond, and where there is about half a yard depth of water; for, by that means, the offal of the feedings will all lie in one place, and the deep water.\nwill serve for a place to retire into and rest in, and will be always clean and in order.\n\nCarp may be fed in the same manner as pike; and though by nature a fish as remarkably shy and timorous as the pike is bold and fearless, yet by custom they will come to take their food out of the person's hand; and will, like the pike, quarrel among one another for the nicest bits.\n\n**Pike**, in *War*, an offensive weapon, consisting of a wooden shaft, 12 or 14 feet long, with a flat steel head, pointed, called the *spear*. This weapon was long in use among the infantry; but now the bayonet, which is fixed on the muzzle of the firelock, is substituted in its stead. It is still used by some of the officers of infantry, under the name of *spontoon*. The Macedonian phalanx was a battalion of pikemen. See PHALANX.\n\n**Pila marina**, or the *sea-ball*, in *Natural History*, is the name of a substance very common on the shores of the Mediterranean, and elsewhere. It is generally found in the form of a ball about the size of the balls of horse dung, and composed of a variety of fibrils irregularly complicated. Various conjectures have been given of its origin by different authors. John Bauhine tells us, that it consists of small hairy fibres and straws, such as are found about the sea plant called *algae vivariarum*; but he does not ascertain what plant it owes its origin to. Imperatus imagined it consisted of the exuviae both of vegetable and animal bodies. Mercatus is doubtful whether it be a congeries of the fibrils of plants, wound up into a ball by the motion of the sea water, or whether it be not the workmanship of some sort of beetle living about the sea shore, and analogous to our common dung beetle's ball, which it elaborates from dung for the reception of its progeny. Schreckius says it is composed of the filaments of some plant of the reed kind; and Welchius supposes it is composed of the papous part of the flowers of the reed. Maurice Hoffman thinks it the excrement of the hippopotamus; and others think it that of the phoca or sea calf. Klein, who had thoroughly and minutely examined the bodies themselves, and all what authors had conjectured concerning them, thinks that they are wholly owing to, and entirely composed of, the calliaments which the leaves, growing to the woody stalk of the *algae vivariarum*, have when they wither and decay. These leaves, in their natural state, are as thick as a wheat straw, and they are placed so thick about the tops and extremities of the stalks, that they enfold, embrace, and lie over one another; and from the middle of these clusters of leaves, and indeed from the woody substance of the plant itself, there arise several other very long, flat, smooth, and brittle leaves. These are usually four from each tuft of the other leaves; and they have ever a common vagina, which is membranaceous and very thin. This is the style of the plant, and the *pila marina* appears to be a cluster of the fibres of the leaves of this plant, which cover the whole stalk, divided into their constituent fibres; and by the motion of the waves first broken and worn into short threads, and afterwards wound up together into a roundish or lengthened ball.\n\n**Pila**, was a ball made in a different manner according to the different games in which it was to be used. Playing at ball was very common amongst the Romans of the first diffusion, and was looked upon as a manly exercise, which contributed both to amusement and health. The pila was of four sorts: 1st, *Follis* or balloon; 2d, *Pila Trigonalis*; 3d, *Pila Paganica*; 4th, *Harpagium*. All these come under the general name of pila. For the manner of playing with each of them, see the articles FOLLIS, TRIGONALIS.","sp":163,"ep":164},{"h":"PILASTER","t":"in Architecture. See there, No 50, &c.\n\n**Pilate**, or Pontius Pilate, was governor of Judea when our Lord was crucified. Of his family or country we know but little, though it is believed that he was of Rome, or at least of Italy. He was sent to govern Judea in the room of Gratius, in the year 26 or 27 of the vulgar era, and governed this province for ten years, from the 12th or 13th year of Tiberius to the 22d or 23d. He is represented both by Philo and Josephus as a man of an impetuous and obstinate temper, and as a judge who used to sell justice, and to pronounce any sentence that was desired, provided he was paid for it. The same authors make mention of his rapines, his injuries, his murders, the torments that he inflicted upon the innocent, and the persons he put to death without any form of process. Philo, in particular, describes him as a man that exercised an excessive cruelty during the whole time of his government, who disturbed the repose of Judea, and gave occasion to the troubles and revolt that followed after. St Luke (xiii. 1, 2, &c.) acquaints us, that Pilate had mingled the blood of the Galileans with their sacrifices; and that the matter having been related to Jesus Christ, he said, \"Think you that these Galileans were greater sinners than other Galileans, because they suffered this calamity. I tell you nay; and if you do not repent, you shall all perish in like manner.\" It is unknown upon what occasion Pilate caused these Galileans to be slain in the temple while they were sacrificing; for this is the meaning of that expression of mingling their blood with their sacrifices. Some think they were disciples of Judas the Gaulonite, who taught that the Jews ought not to pay tribute to foreign princes; and that Pilate had put some of them to death even in the temple; but there is no proof of this fact. Others think that these Galileans were Samaritans, whom Pilate cut to pieces in the village of Tirataba, as they were preparing to go up to Mount Gerizim, where a certain Antig. lib. impolior had promised to discover treasures to them; but this event did not happen before the year 35 of the common era, and consequently two years after the death of Jesus Christ. At the time of our Saviour's passion, Pilate made some endeavours to deliver him out of the hands of the Jews. He knew they had delivered him up, and purified his life with so much violence, only out of malice and envy (Matt. xxvii. 18.). His wife also, who had been disturbed the night before with frightful dreams, sent to tell him she desired him not to meddle in the affair of that just person (ib. 19.). He attempted to appease the wrath of the Jews, and to give them some satisfaction, by whipping Jesus Christ (John xix. 1. Matt. xxvii. 26.). He tried to take him out of their hands, by proposing to deliver him or Barabbas, on the day of the festival of the passover. Lastly, he had a mind to discharge himself from pronouncing judgement against him, by sending him to Herod king of Galilee (Luke xxiii. 7, 8.). When he saw all this would not satisfy the Jews, and that they even threatened him in some manner, saying he could be no friend to the emperor if he let him go (John xix. 12, 15.), he caused\nwater to be brought, washed his hands before all the people, and publicly declared himself innocent of the blood of that just person (Matt. xxvii. 23, 24.); yet at the same time he delivered him up to his soldiers, that they might crucify him. This was enough to justify Jesus Christ, as Calmet observes, and to show that he held him as innocent; but it was not enough to vindicate the conscience and integrity of a judge, whose duty it was as well to assert the cause of oppressed innocence as to punish the guilty and criminal. He ordered to be put over our Saviour's cross, as it were, an abstract of his sentence, and the motive of his condemnation (John xix. 9.), Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews, which was written in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Some of the Jews found fault with it, and remonstrated to Pilate that he ought to have written Jesus of Nazareth, who pretended to be king of the Jews. But Pilate could not be prevailed with to alter it, and gave them this peremptory answer, That what he had written he had written.\n\nTowards evening, he was applied to for leave to take down the bodies from the cross, that they might not continue there the following day, which was the passover and the Sabbath-day (John xix. 31.). This he allowed, and granted the body of Jesus to Joseph of Arimathea, that he might pay his last duties to it, (ib. 33.). Lastly, when the priests, who had solicited the death of our Saviour, came to desire him to set a watch about the sepulchre, for fear his disciples should steal him away by night, he answered them, that they had a guard, and might place them there themselves (Matt. xxvii. 65.). This is the substance of what the gospel tells us concerning Pilate.\n\nJustin Martyr, Tertullian, Eusebius, and after them several others both ancient and modern, assure us, that it was formerly the custom for Roman magistrates to prepare copies of all verbal proceedings and judicial acts which they passed in their several provinces, and to send them to the emperor. And Pilate, in compliance to this custom, having sent word to Tiberius of what had passed relating to Jesus Christ, the emperor wrote an account of it to the senate, in a manner that gave reason to judge that he thought favourably of the religion of Jesus Christ, and showed that he should be willing they would decree divine honours to him. But the senate was not of the same opinion, and so the matter was dropped. It appears by what Justin says of these acts, that the miracles of Jesus Christ were mentioned there, and even that the soldiers had divided his garments among them. Eusebius intimates that they spoke of his resurrection and ascension. Tertullian and Justin refer to these acts with so much confidence as would make one believe they had them in their hands. However, neither Eusebius nor St Jerome, who were both inquisitive, understanding persons, nor any other author that wrote afterwards, seem to have seen them, at least not the true and original acts; for as to what we have now in great number, they are not authentic, being neither ancient nor uniform. There are also some pretended letters of Pilate to Tiberius, giving a history of our Saviour, but they are universally allowed to be spurious.\n\nPilate being a man that, by his excessive cruelties and rapine, had disturbed the peace of Judea during the whole time of his government, was at length deposed by Vitellius the proconsul of Syria, in the 36th year of Jesus Christ, and sent to Rome to give an account of his conduct to the emperor. But though Tiberius died before Pilate arrived at Rome, yet his successor Caligula banished him to Vienne in Gaul, where he was reduced to such extremity that he killed himself with his own hands. The evangelists call him governor, though in reality he was no more than procurator of Judea, not only because governor was a name of general use, but because Pilate in effect acted as one, by taking upon him to judge in criminal matters; as his predecessors had done, and other procurators in the small provinces of the empire where there was no proconsul, constantly did. See Calmet's Dictionary, Eckhard's Ecclesiastical Dictionary, and Beaupr\u00e9's Annotations.\n\nWith regard to Pilate's wife, the general tradition is, that she was named Claudia Procula or Procula; and in relation to her dream, some are of opinion that she had intelligence of our Lord's apprehension, and knew by his character that he was a righteous person; her imagination, being struck with these ideas, did naturally produce the dream we read of; but others think that this dream was sent providentially upon her, for the clearer manifestation of our Lord's innocence.","sp":164,"ep":165},{"h":"PILATRE DU ROZIER","t":"French, was born at Metz the 30th of March 1756.

He performed several other excursions in this way with brilliant success, in the presence of the royal family of France, of the king of Sweden, and of Prince Henry of Prussia. He then resolved to pass into England by means of his aerial vehicle, and for that purpose he repaired to Boulogne, whence he rose about 7 o'clock in the morning of the 1st June 1785; but in half an hour after he set out, the balloon took fire, and the aeronaut, with his companion M.

The body of the pilchard is less compressed than that of the herring, being thicker and rounder: the nose is shorter in proportion, and turns up; the under jaw is shorter. The back is more elevated; the belly less sharp. The dorsal fin of the pilchard is placed exactly in the centre of gravity, so that when taken up by it, the body preserves an equilibrium, whereas that of the herring dips at the head. The scales of the pilchard adhere very closely, whereas those of the herring very easily drop off. The pilchard is in general less than the herring; but it is fatter, or more full of oil.\nThe pilchard appears in vast shoals off the Cornish coasts about the middle of July, disappearing the beginning of winter, yet sometimes a few return again after Christmas. Their winter retreat is the same with that of the herring, and their motives for migrating the same. They affect, during summer, a warmer latitude; for they are not found in any quantities on any of our coasts except those of Cornwall, that is to say, from Fowey harbour to the Scilly isles, between which places the shoals keep shifting for some weeks. The approach of the pilchard is known by much the same signs as those that indicate the arrival of the herring. Persons, called in Cornwall hurrs, are placed on the cliffs, to point to the boats stationed off the land the course of the fish. By the Act of James I. c. 23, fishermen are empowered to go on the grounds of others to hue, without being liable to actions of trespass, which before occasioned frequent law-suits.\n\nThe emoluments that accrue to the inhabitants of that country are great, and are best expressed in the words of Dr W. Borlase, in his Account of the Pilchard Fishery. \"It employs a great number of men on the sea, training them thereby to naval affairs; employs men, women, and children, at land, in salting, pressing, washing, and cleaning, in making boats, nets, ropes, casks, and all the trades depending on their construction and sale. The poor is fed with the offal of the captures; the land with the refuse of the fish and salt; the merchant finds the gains of commission and honest commerce; the fisherman, the gains of the fish. Ships are often freighted hither with salt, and into foreign countries with the fish, carrying off at the same time part of our tin. The usual number of hogheads of fish exported each year, for ten years, from 1747 to 1756 inclusive, from the four ports of Fowey, Falmouth, Penzance, and St Ives, in all amounts to 29,794; since it appears that Fowey has exported yearly 1732 hogheads; Falmouth, 14,631 hogheads and two-thirds; Penzance and Mounts Bay, 12,140 hogheads and one-third; St Ives, 1282 hogheads. Every hoghead for ten years last past, together with the bounty allowed for each when exported, and the oil made out of each, has amounted, one year with another at an average, to the price of \u00a31. 13s. 3d.; so that the cash paid for pilchards exported has, at a medium, annually amounted to the sum of \u00a349,552.10s.\" The numbers that are taken at one shooting out of the nets is amazingly great. Mr Pennant says, that Dr Borlase assured him, that on the 5th of October 1767, there were at one time inclosed in St Ives's bay 7000 hogheads, each hoghead containing 35,000 fish, in all 245,000,000.","sp":165,"ep":166},{"h":"PILE","t":"among the Greeks and Romans, was a pyramid built of wood, whereon were laid the bodies of the deceased to be burnt.

For the pilgrimage of the followers of Mahomet, see Mahometanism.\n\nIn every country where popery was established, pilgrimages were common; and in those countries which are still papish, they continue. In England, the shrine of St Thomas \u00e0 Becket was the chief resort of the pious; and in Scotland, St Andrews; where, as tradition informs us, was deposited a leg of the holy apostle. In Ireland they still continue; for, from the beginning of May till the middle of August every year, crowds of papish penitents from all parts of that country resort to an island near the centre of Lough-foo, or White Lake, in the county of Donegal, to the amount of 3000 or 4000. These are mostly of the poorer sort, and many of them are proxies for those who are richer; some of which, however, together with some of the priests and bishops on occasion, make their appearance there. When the pilgrim comes within sight of the holy lake, he must uncover his hands and feet, and thus walk to the water-side, and is taken to the island for inspection. Here there are two chapels and 15 other houses; to which are added confessional, so contrived, that the priest cannot see the person confessing. The penance varies according to the circumstances of the penitent; during the continuance of which (which is sometimes three, six, or nine days) he subsists on oatmeal, sometimes made into bread. He traverses sharp stones on his bare knees or feet, and goes through a variety of other forms, paying inspection at every different confession. When all is over, the priest bores a gimblet-hole through the pilgrim's staff near the top, in which he fastens a cross peg; gives him as many holy pebbles out of the lake as he cares to carry away, for amulets to be presented to his friends, and so disposes him, an object of veneration to all other papists not thus initiated, who no sooner see the pilgrim's cross in his hands, than they kneel down to get his blessing.\n\nThere are, however, other parts of Ireland sacred to extraordinary worship and pilgrimage; and the number of holy wells, and miraculous cures, &c., produced by them, is very great. That such things should exist in this enlightened age, and in a Protestant country, is indeed strange; but our wonder ceases, when we reflect that it is among the lowest; and perhaps the worst of the people. They who carry external religion to an extreme, and place that confidence in ceremony which belongs only to the spirit of it, are seldom distinguished either for their wisdom or their virtue. We do not deny, however, that they who carry matters to the other extreme, may be equally destitute of real knowledge and genuine morality.\n\nDr Johnson, in his Rasselas, gives us some observations on pilgrimage, which are so much to the purpose, that we think we cannot do better than lay them before our readers. \"Pilgrimage (said Imalac, into whose mouth the observations are put), like many other acts of piety, may be reasonable or superstitious according to the principles upon which it is performed. Long journeys in search of truth are not commanded. Truth, such as is necessary to the regulation of life, is always found where it is honestly sought: change of place is no natural cause of the increase of piety, for it inevitably produces dissipation of mind. Yet since men go every day to view the fields where great actions have been performed, and return with stronger impressions of the event, curiosity of the same kind may naturally dispose us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning: and I believe no man surveys those awful scenes without some confirmation of holy resolutions. That the Supreme Being may be more easily propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle superstition; but that some places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which hourly experience will justify. He who supposes that his vices may be more successfully combated in Palestine, will, perhaps, find himself mistaken; yet he may go thither without folly: he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned, dishonours at once his reason and religion.\"","sp":169,"ep":170},{"h":"PILKINGTON","t":"Letitia, a famous poetical genius, the daughter of Dr Van Lewin, a physician of Dublin, where she was born in 1712.

They were at length totally separated, on the husband accidentally discovering a gentleman in her bedchamber at two o'clock in the morning; a circumstance which she accounted for in a very unsatisfactory manner. The story is told at large in her Memoirs; where she says, \"Lovers of learning, I am sure, will pardon me, as I solemnly declare it was the attractive charms of a new book, which the gentleman would not lend me, but consented to stay till I read it through, that was the sole motive of my detaining him.\" As there are not wanting some who form objections to marrying learned wives, the chance of such literary affinities may perhaps be added to the list of them.

It is thought that they point out some prey to the dog-fish. They are not only not touched, but also preferred by it against all their enemies.\n\nIt likewise follows the shark, apparently for the purpose of devouring the remains of its prey. It is pretended that it acts as its pilot. The manner in which it attends the shark, according to M. Daubenton, may have given rise to this name. It is said to swim at the height of a foot and a half from the snout of this voracious animal, to follow and imitate all its movements, and to seize with address every part of its prey which the shark allows to escape, and which is light enough to buoy up towards the surface of the water. When the shark, which has its mouth below, turns to seize any fish, the pilot-fish starts away; but as soon as the shark resumes his ordinary position, it returns to its former place. It is said, that in the gulf of Guinea those fishes follow ships for the sake of the offal and human excrements; and hence the Dutch give them the name of dungen-fish. It is remarkable, that though so small they can keep pace with ships in their swiftest course.","sp":171,"ep":172},{"h":"PILTON","t":"a division of Courland, which lies in Courland properly so called, derives its name from the ancient castle or palace of Pilton, built by Valdemar II., king of Denmark about the year 1220, when he founded a bishop's see in this country for the more effectual conversion of its Pagan inhabitants. This district afterwards successively belonged to the Germans, then again to the king of Denmark, the duke of Courland, and to Poland; and by virtue of the instrument of regency drawn up for this district in the year 1717, the government is lodged in seven Polish senators or councillors, from whom an appeal lies to the king. The bishop of Samogitia also styles himself bishop of Pilton.\n\nThe most remarkable part of this district is the promontory of Domeinfs, which projects northward into the gulf of Livonia. From this cape, a sand-bank runs four German miles farther into the sea, half of which lies under water, and cannot be discerned. To the east of this promontory is an unfathomable abyss, which is never observed to be agitated. For the safety of vessels bound to Livonia, two square beacons have been erected on the coast, near Domeinfs church, opposite to the sand bank, and facing each other. One of these is twelve fathoms high, and the other eight; and a large fire is kept burning on them from the first of August to the first of January. When the mariners see these fires appear as one in a direct line, they may conclude that they are clear of the extremity of the sand bank, and consequently out of danger; but if they see both beacons, they are in danger of running upon it.

Julius Scaliger laboured much to give an accurate account of it, and would have effected success on this head amongst the greatest blessings of his life. This weapon appears, however, to have been sometimes round, but most commonly square, to have been two cubits long in the staff, and to have had an iron point of the same length hooked and jagged at the end. Marius made a material improvement in it; for during the Cimbrian war, he so contrived it, that when it stuck in the enemy's shield it should bend down in an angle in the part where the wood was connected with the iron, and thus become useless to the person who received it.","sp":172,"ep":172},{"h":"PIMENTO","t":"PIEMENTO, Jamaica pepper, or Allspice, a species of myrtus.

The usual method of forming a new pimento plantation (in Jamaica it is called a walk) is nothing more than to appropriate a piece of woodland, in the neighbourhood of a plantation already existing, or in a country where the scattered trees are found in a native state, the woods of which being fallen, the trees are suffered to remain on the ground till they become rotten and perish. In the course of twelve months after the first season, abundance of young pimento plants will be found growing vigorously in all parts of the land, being without doubt produced from ripe berries scattered there by the birds, while the fallen trees, &c., afford them both shelter and shade. At the end of two years it will be proper to give the land a thorough cleaning, leaving such only of the pimento trees as have a good appearance, which will then soon form such groves as those I have described, and, except perhaps for the first four or five years, require very little attention afterwards.\n\nSoon after the trees are in blossom, the berries become fit for gathering; the fruit not being suffered to ripen on the tree, as the pulp in that state, being moist and glutinous, is difficult to cure, and when dry becomes black and tasteless. It is impossible, however, to prevent some of the ripe berries from mixing with the refuse; but if the proportion of them be great, the price of the commodity is considerably injured.\n\nIt is gathered by the hand; one labourer on the tree, employed in gathering the small branches, will give employment to three below (who are generally women and children) in picking the berries; and an industrious picker will fill a bag of 70 lbs. in the day.\n\nThe returns from a pimento walk in a favourable season are prodigious. A single tree has been known to yield 150 lbs. of the raw fruit, or one cwt. of the dried spice; there being commonly a lot in weight of one third in curing; but this, like many other of the minor productions, is exceedingly uncertain, and perhaps a very plentiful crop occurs but once in five years.\"","sp":172,"ep":173},{"h":"PIMPINELLA","t":"Burnet Saxifrage; a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria class.

We shall therefore give our readers an account of it from Ellis's Campagna of London.\n\nWhen the brass-wire, of which the pins are formed, is first received at the factory, it is generally too thick for the purpose of being cut into pins. The first operation therefore is that of winding it off from one wheel to another with great velocity, and causing it to pass between the two, through a circle in a piece of iron of smaller diameter: the wire, being thus reduced to its proper dimensions, is strained by drawing it between iron pins fixed in a board in a zig-zag manner, but so as to leave a straight line between them: afterwards it is cut into lengths of three or four yards, and then into smaller ones, every length being sufficient to make six pins; each end of these is ground to a point, which was performed when I viewed the factory by boys who sat each with two small grinding stones before him, turned by a wheel. Taking up a handful, he applies the ends to the coarsest of the two stones, being careful at the same time to keep each piece moving round between his fingers, so that the points may not become flat: he then gives them a smoother and sharper point, by applying them to the other stone, and by that means a lad of 12 or 14 years of age is enabled to point about 16,000 pins in an hour. When the wire is thus pointed, a pin is taken off from each end, and this is repeated till it is cut into six pieces. The next operation is that of forming the heads, or, as they term it, head-spinning; which is done by means of a spinning-wheel, one piece of wire being thus with astonishing rapidity wound round another, and the interior one being drawn out, leaves a hollow tube between the circumvolutions: it is then cut with shears; every two circumvolutions or turns of the wire forming one head; these are softened by throwing them into iron pans, and placing them in a furnace till they are red hot. As soon as they are cold, they are distributed to children, who fit with anvils and hammers before them, which they work with their feet, by means of a lathe, and taking up one of the lengths, they thrust the blunt end into a quantity of the heads which lie before them, and catching one at the extremity, they apply them immediately to the anvil and hammer, and by a motion or two of the foot, the point and the head are fixed together in much less time than it can be described, and with a dexterity only to be acquired by practice; the spectator being in continual apprehension.","sp":173,"ep":173},{"h":"PINACIA","t":"among the Athenians, were tablets of brafs inscribed with the names of all those citizens in each tribe who were duly qualified and willing to be judges of the court of Areopagus.

He received his first musical instructions from his father, who was a flutist-player by profession; after which, according to Suidas, he was placed under Myrtilis, a lady of distinguished abilities in lyric poetry. It was during this period that he became acquainted with the poetess Corinna, who was likewise a student under Myrtilis. Plutarch tells us, that Pindar profited from the lessons which Corinna, more advanced in her studies, gave him at this school. It is very natural to suppose, that the first poetical effusions of a genius so full of fire and imagination as that of Pindar would be wild and luxuriant; and Lucian has preserved five verses, said to have been the exordium of his first essay; in which he crowded almost all the subjects for song which ancient history and mythology then furnished. Upon communicating this attempt to Corinna, she told him smiling, that he should fow with the hand, and not empty his whole flask at once. Pindar, however, soon quitted Pindar, the leading strings of these ladies, his poetical nurture, and became the disciple of Simonides, now arrived at extreme old age: after which he soon surpassed all his masters, and acquired great reputation over all Greece; but, like a true prophet, he was less honoured in his own country than elsewhere; for at Thebes he was frequently pronounced to be vanquished, in the musical and poetical contests, by candidates of inferior merit.\n\nThe custom of having these public trials of skill in all the great cities of Greece was now so prevalent, that but little fame was to be acquired by a musician or poet any other way than by entering the lists; and we find, that both Myrtilis and Corinna publicly disputed the prize with him at Thebes. He obtained a victory over Myrtilis, but was vanquished five different times by Corinna. The judges, upon occasions like these, have been frequently accused of partiality or ignorance, not only by the vanquished, but by politeness; and if the merit of Pindar was pronounced inferior to that of Corinna five several times, it was, says Pausanias, because the judges were more sensible to the charms of beauty than to those of music and poetry (a). Was it not strange, said the Scythian Anacharsis, that the Grecian artists were never judged by artists, their peers?\n\nPindar, before he quitted Thebes, had the vexation to see his Dithyrambics traduced, abused, and turned into ridicule, by the comic poets of his time; and Athenaeus tells us, that he was feverishly censured by his brother lyrics, for being a lipogrammatist, and composing an ode from which he had excommunicated the letter S. Whether these censures proceeded from envy or contempt cannot now be determined; but they were certainly useful to Pindar, and it was necessary that he should be lauded for such puerilities. Thebes seems to have been the purgatory of our young bard: when he quitted that city, as his judgement was matured, he avoided most of the errors for which he had been chastised, and suddenly became the wonder and delight of all Greece. Every hero, prince, and potentate, deafuous of lasting fame, courted the muse of Pindar.\n\nHe seems frequently to have been present at the four great festivals, of the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games, as may be inferred from several circumstances and expressions in the odes which he composed for the victors in them all. Those at Olympia, who were ambitious of having their achievements celebrated by Pindar, applied to him for an ode, which was first sung in the Prytaneum or town-hall of Olympia, where there was a banqueting-room, set apart for the entertainment of the conquerors. Here the ode was rehearsed by a chorus, accompanied by instruments. It was afterwards performed in the same manner at the triumphal entry of the victor into his own country, in processions, or at the sacrifices that were made with great pomp and solemnity on the occasion.\n\n(a) Pausanias says, that Corinna was one of the most beautiful women of her time, as he judged by a picture of her which he saw at Tanagris at the place where the public exercises were performed. She was represented with her head ornamented by a ribbon, as a memorial of the victories she had obtained over Pindar at Thebes.\nPindar, in his second Isthmian ode, has apologized for the mercenary custom among poets, of receiving money for their compositions. \"The world (says he) is grown interested, and thinks in general with the Spartan philosopher Aristostratus, that money only makes the man: a truth which this sage himself experienced, having with his riches lost all his friends.\" It is supposed that Pindar here alludes to the avarice of Simonides, who first allowed his muse to sell her favours to the highest bidder.\n\nThere is no great poet in antiquity whose moral character has been less censured than that of Pindar. Plutarch has preferred a single verse of his Epicedium or Dirge that was sung at his funeral; which, short and simple as it is, implies great praise: This man was pleasing to strangers, and dear to his fellow-citizens. His works abound with precepts of the purest morality: and it does not appear that he ever traduced even his enemies; comforting himself, for their malignity, by a maxim which he inserted in his first Pythic, and which afterwards became proverbial, That it is better to be envied than pitied.\n\nPaulanias says, that the character of poet was truly consecrated, in the person of Pindar, by the god of verse himself; who was pleased, by an express oracle, to order the inhabitants of Delphi to set apart for Pindar one half of the first-fruit offerings brought by the religious to his shrine, and to allow him a conspicuous place in his temple, where, in an iron chair, he used to sit and sing his hymns in honour of that god. This chair was remaining in the time of Paulanias, several centuries after, and shown to him as a relic not unworthy of the sanctity and magnificence of that place.\n\nBut though Pindar's muse was patronized at Delphi, and well paid by princes and potentates elsewhere, she seems, however, sometimes to have sung the spontaneous strains of pure friendship. Of this kind were, probably, the verses bestowed upon the musician Midas, of Agrigentum in Sicily, who had twice obtained the palm of victory by his performance on the flute at the Pythic games (b). It is in his 12th Pythic ode that Pindar celebrates the victory of Midas over all Greece, upon that instrument which Minerva herself had invented (c).\n\nFabricius tells us, that Pindar lived to the age of 90; and, according to the chronology of Dr Blair, he died 435 years B.C. aged 86. His fellow citizens erected a monument to him in the Hippodrome at Thebes, which was still subsisting in the time of Paulanias; and his renown was so great after his death, that his posterity derived very considerable honours and privileges from it. When Alexander the Great attacked the city of Thebes, he gave express orders to his soldiers to spare the house and family of Pindar. The Lacedemonians had done the same before this period; for when they ravaged Boeotia and burned the capital, the following words were written upon the door of the poet: Forbear to burn this house, it was the dwelling of Pindar. Respect for the memory of this great poet continued so long, that, even in Plutarch's time, the best part of the sacred victim at the Theoxenian festival was appropriated to his descendants.","sp":174,"ep":175},{"h":"PINDARIC ODE","t":"in Poetry, an ode formed in imitation of the manner of Pindar.

The ore, or mineral, of silver, when dug out of the veins of the mine, is first broken and then ground in mills for the purpose, driven by water with iron pestles, each of 200 pounds weight. The mineral, when thus pulverized, is next fitted, and then worked up with water into a paste; which, when half dry, is cut into pieces, called cuerpos, a foot long, weighing each about two thousand five hundred pounds.\n\nEach piece or cuerpo is again kneaded up with sea-salt, which, dissolving, incorporates with it. They then add mercury, from 10 to 20 pounds for each cuerpo, kneading the paste afresh until the mercury be incorporated therewith. This office, which is exceedingly dangerous on account of the noxious qualities of the mercury, is always made the lot of the poor Indians. This amalgamation is continued for eight or nine days; and some add lime, lead, or tin ore, &c. to forward it; and, in some mines, they are obliged to use fire. To try whether or no the mixture and amalgamation be sufficient, they wash a piece in water; and if the mercury be white, it is a proof that it has had its effect; if black, it must be still farther worked.\n\n---\n\n(b) This Midas is a very different personage from his long-eared majesty of Phrygia, whose decision in favour of Pan had given such offence to Apollo; as is manifest, indeed, from his having been contemporary with Pindar.\n\n(c) The most extraordinary part of this musician's performance that can be gathered from the scholiast upon Pindar, was his finishing the solo, without a reed or mouth-piece, which broke accidentally while he was playing. The legendary account given by the poet in this ode, of the occasion upon which the flute was invented by Minerva, is diverting: \"It was (says he) to imitate the howling of the Gorgons, and the hissing of their snakes, which the goddess had heard when the head of Medusa (one of these three anti-graces) was cut off by Perseus.\"\nWhen finished, it is sent to the lavatories, which are large basins that empty successively into one another. The palls, &c., being laid in the uppermost of these, the earth is then washed from it into the rest by a rivulet turned upon it; an Indian, all the while, stirring it with his feet, and two other Indians doing the like in the other basins. When the water runs quite clear out of the basins, the mercury and silver are found at bottom incorporated. This matter they call *pella*, and of this they form the pineas, by expressing as much of the mercury as they can; first, by putting it in woollen bags, and pressing and beating it strongly; then, by stamping it in a kind of wooden mould, of an octagonal form, at bottom whereof is a brass plate pierced full of little holes. The matter, when taken out of the mould, is laid on a trivet, under which is a large vessel full of water; and the whole being covered with an earthen head, a fire is made round it.\n\nThe mercury still remains in the mass, and is thus reduced into fumes, and, at length condensing, it is precipitated into the water, leaving behind it a mass of silver grains of different figures, which, only joining or touching at the extremes, render the matter very porous and light. This, therefore, is the pinea, or pigne, which the workmen endeavour to sell secretly to vessels trading to the South Sea; and from which those, who have ventured to engage in so dangerous a commerce, have made such vast gains. Indeed the traders herein must be very careful; for the Spanish miners are arrant knaves, and to make the pignes weigh the more, they often fill the middle with sand or iron.\n\n**PINEAL GLAND.** See Brain, Anatomy Index.","sp":175,"ep":176},{"h":"PINEAU","t":"GABRIEL DU,** a distinguished lawyer, was born at Angers in 1573.

He corresponded with Justus Lipsius, Joseph Scaliger, Sigonius, Poffevin, Peter Pithou, and a great many others, who have all paid the highest compliments to his erudition. Indifferent to all the pleasures of life, and acquainted only with those of the mind, he had a great dislike to plays, entertainments, shows, and everything which most excites the curiosity of other men. During the space of 43 years that he lived at Padua, he was never known to be out of the city but twice; once on occasion of a plague which infested it; and afterwards on a voyage to Naples, which he made at the earnest solicitation of his friends.

Again, lib. ix. 66. he says, the pinna is of the genus of shell-fish; it is produced in muddy waters, always erect, nor ever without a companion, which some call the pinnoterex, others the pinophylax. This sometimes is a small squill, sometimes a crab, that follows the pinna for the sake of food. The pinna, upon opening its shell, exposes itself as a prey to the smallest kind of fishes; for they immediately assault her, and, growing bolder upon finding no resistance, venture in. The guard, watching its time, gives notice by a bite; upon which the pinna, closing its shell, shuts in, kills, and gives part of whatever happens to be there to its companion.\n\nThe pinna and the crab together dwell,\nFor mutual succour, in one common shell.\nThey both to gain a livelihood combine;\nThat takes the prey, when this has given the sign.\nFrom hence this crab, above his fellows fam'd,\nBy ancient Greeks was pinnoterex nam'd.\u2014Oppian.\n\nPinnace, a small vessel navigated with oars and sails, and having generally two masts, which are rigged like those of a schooner.\n\nPinnace is also a boat usually rowed with eight oars.

His zeal for the progress and advancement of science rendered him very communicative of his knowledge and of his books; but this was always done with judgement and discretion. He died in 1621, aged 68, without having published any work. Paul Gualdo, who has written Pinelli's life, does not specify the number of volumes of which his rich library consisted: he only informs us, that when it was transported by sea to Naples, it was packed up in 130 chests, of which 14 contained manuscripts; but it did not go wholly to his heirs. The senate of Venice caused their seal to be set upon the manuscripts, and took away whatever concerned the affairs of the republic, to the number of 200 pieces.\n\n\"I compare (says President de Thon) Pinelli to Titus Pomponius; for, as that illustrious Roman was called Atticus, Pinelli also bore the title of Venetian, on account of the great affection which the republic of Venice had for him.\n\nPinet, Antony du, lord of Noroy, an ecclesiastical writer, lived in the 16th century, and was a native of Besan\u00e7on. He was strongly attached to the Protestant religion, and a bitter enemy to the church of Rome.

He published the last-mentioned performance under this title: Taxe des parties castrales de la L\u00e9gislature du Pape, in Latin and French, with some notes taken from decrees, councils, and canons, in order to ascertain the discipline anciently observed in the church. In the epistle dedicatory, he affirms the tone of a declared enemy to the court of Rome. He apologizes for having presented this book \"to a society so holy as yours (the Protestants), in which are heard only hymns, psalms, and praises, to the Lord our God: but it is proper to throw to the villain his villany, and the fool his folly, lest one should be thought to resemble them.\" We see by this specimen, that Pinet had no more politeness in his style than in his manners. His translation of Pliny's Natural History, printed at Lyons in 2 vol. folio, 1566, and at Paris, 1608, was formerly much read. Though there are a good many errors in it, it is yet very useful at present, especially for those who understand Pliny's Latin, on account of the translator's researches, and a great number of marginal notes. Pinet also published Plans of the principal fortresses in the world at Lyons, 1564, in folio.\n\nPing-leang fou, a city of China in the province of Chen-fu.

The last work he was engaged in was a Nativity for the monastery of St Francis at Siena: the monks accommodated him with a chamber to work in, which they cleared of all the furniture, except one old trunk or chest that appeared too rotten to move; but Pinturicchio, naturally polite and peevish, insisted on its being taken away, and the monks, willing to gratify him, complied. It was no sooner stirred than one of the planks bursting, out tumbled 500 pieces of gold, which had been secreted there for many years.

See Botany Index. The pine-tree was well known to the ancients, and has been described and celebrated both by their philosophers and poets. Pliny enumerates no less than six species of trees of this genus; and it is mentioned by Virgil both in his Eclogues, his Georgics, and his Aeneid; by Horace in his Odes; by Ovid in his Metamorphoses; by Statius; and by Catullus, &c. Macrobius relates an anecdote concerning the cones of pine-trees, which in common language were called poma pin\u00e6a, \"pine-apples.\" There lived in the Augustan age one Vatinius, who by some means had irritated the Roman people so much that they pelted him with stones. When he entertained them with gladiators, to save himself from such treatment for the future, he procured an edict from the ediles, that no person should throw any thing but apples in the amphitheatre. It accidentally happened that at this time C\u00e6cilius, eminent for his wit as well as knowledge of the law, was consulted on the question, whether a pine-apple (the cone of the pine) was legally included in the term pomum, \"an apple\"? It is an apple (said he) if you intend to fling it at Vatinius*. A decision by which the edict in his favour did not much mend his situation: for Martial represents it dangerous rap. 6. to come under this tree, because the cones in his time were of so great a size and weight, probably enlarged by cultivation for ages.\n\nNuces Pin\u00e6\u00e6.\n\nPoma furnus Cybeles: procul hinc discedite, visior,\nNe cadat in infernum nostra ruina caput\u2020. Lib. xiii.\n\nThere are generally reckoned 14 species of this genus; of which the most remarkable are these following:\n\n1. The pinea, pineager, or wild pine, grows naturally on the mountains in Italy and the south of France. It grows to the size of a large tree; the branches extend to a considerable distance; and while the trees are young, they are fully furnished with leaves, especially where they are not so close as to exclude the air from those within; but as they advance in age, the branches appear naked, and all those which are situated below become unfruitful in a few years; for which reason they are now much less in esteem than formerly.\n\n2. The pinus pin\u00e6a, or stone pine, is a tall evergreen tree, native of Italy and Spain. It delights in a sandy loam, though like most others it will grow well in almost any land. Respecting the uses of this species, Hanbury tells us that \"the kernels are eatable, and by many preferred to almonds. In Italy they are served up at table in their shells.\"\u2014They are exceeding wholesome, being good for coughs, colds, consumptions, &c. on which account only this tree deserves to be propagated.\" Hanbury continues: \"It may be very proper here to take notice of a very great and dangerous mistake Mr Miller has committed, by saying, under this article of stone-pine, that seeds kept in the cones will be good, and grow if they are sown ten or twelve years after the cones have been gathered from the trees; whereas the seeds of this sort, whether kept in the cones or taken out, are never good after the first year; and though sometimes a few plants will come up from the seeds that are kept in the cones for two years before, yet this is but seldom; neither must a tenth part of a crop be expected. This caution is the more necessary, as several gentlemen who had cones, upon reading Mr Miller's book, and finding the seeds would take no damage when kept there, deferred the work for a season or two, when they thought they should have more conveniency either of men or ground for their purpose; and were afterwards wholly disappointed, no plants appearing,\"\npearing, the seeds being by that time spoiled and worth nothing.\"\n\n3. The rubra, commonly called the Scots fir or pine. It is common throughout Scotland, whence its name; though it is also found in most of the other countries of Europe. M. du Hamel, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, mentions his having received some seeds of it from St Domingo in the West Indies; and thence concludes, that it grows indifferently in the temperate, frigid, and torrid zones. The wood of this tree is the red or yellow deal, which is the most durable of any of the kinds yet known. The leaves of this tree are much shorter and broader than those of the former sort, of a grayish colour, growing two out of one fleath; the cones are small, pyramidal, and end in narrow points; they are of a light colour, and the seeds are small.\n\n4. The pinus picea, or yew-leaved fir, is a tall evergreen, and a native of Scotland, Sweden, and Germany. This species includes the silver fir and the balm of Gilead fir. The first of these is a noble upright tree. Mr. Marshall says, \"The tallest trees I have seen were spruce and silver firs in the valleys in Switzerland. I saw several firs in the dockyards in Venice 40 yards long; and one of 39 yards was 18 inches diameter at the small end. I was told they came from Switzerland.\"\n\nThe branches are not very numerous, and the bark is smooth and delicate. The leaves grow singly on the branches, and their ends are slightly indented. Their upper surface is of a fine strong green colour, and their under has an ornament of two white lines running lengthwise on each side the midrib; on account of which silvery look this sort is called the silver fir. The cones are large, and grow erect; and when the warm weather comes on, they soon shed their seeds; which should be a caution to all who wish to raise this plant, to gather the cones before that happens.\n\nThe balm of Gilead fir has of all the sorts been most coveted, on account of the great fragrance of its leaves; though this is not its only good property: for it is a very beautiful tree, naturally of an upright growth, and the branches are so ornamented with their balmy leaves, as to exceed any of the other sorts in beauty. The leaves, which are very closely set on the branches, are broad; and their ends are indented. Their upper surface, when healthy, is of a fine dark-green colour, and their under has white lines on each side the midrib lengthwise, nearly like those of the silver fir. These leaves when bruised are very finely scented; and the buds, which swell in the autumn for the next year's shoot, are very ornamental all winter, being turgid, and of a fine brown colour: and from these also exudes a kind of fine turpentine, of the same kind of (though heightened) fragrancy. The tree being wounded in any part, emits plenty of this turpentine; and Hanbury says, \"it is supposed by many to be the sort from whence the balm of Gilead is taken, which occasions this tree being so called. But this is a mistake; for the true balm of Gilead is taken from a kind of terebinth: though I am informed, that what has been collected from this tree has been sent over to England from America (where it grows naturally), and often sold in the shops for the true sort.\"\n\nThe silver fir is very hardy, and will grow in any soil or situation, but always makes the greatest progress in rich loamy earth. The balm of Gilead fir must be planted in deep, rich, good earth; nor will it live long in any other. The soil may be a black mould, or of a sandy nature, if it be deep enough, and if the roots have room enough to strike freely.\n\n5. The pinus abies, or European spruce fir, a native of the northern parts of Europe and of Asia, includes the Norway spruce and long-coned Cornish fir. The former of these is a tree of as much beauty while growing as its timber is valuable when propagated on that account. Its growth is naturally like the silver, upright; and the height it will attain to may be easily conceived, when we say that the white deal, so much coveted by the joiners, &c., is the wood of this tree; and it may perhaps satisfy the curious reader to know, that from this fir pitch is drawn. The leaves are of a dark-green colour; they stand singly on the branches, but the younger shoots are very closely garnished with them. They are very narrow; their ends are pointed; and they are peopled of such beauties as to excite admiration. The cones are eight or ten inches long, and hang downwards.\n\nThe better the soil is, the faster will the spruce fir grow, though it will thrive very well in most of our English lands. In strong loamy earth it makes a surprising progress; and it delights in fresh land of all sorts, which never has been worn out by ploughing, &c., though it be ever so poor. The long-coned Cornish fir differs scarcely in any respect from the Norway spruce, except that the leaves and the cones are larger.\n\n6. The pinus Canadensis, American or Newfoundland spruce fir, a native of Canada, Pennsylvania, and other parts of North America, includes three varieties. The white Newfoundland spruce, the red Newfoundland spruce, and the black Newfoundland spruce. These, however, differ so little, that one description is common to them all. They are of a gentle upright growth, though they do not float so freely or grow so fast with us as the Norway spruce. The leaves are of the same green, and garnish the branches in the same beautiful manner as those of that species; only they are narrower, shorter, and stand closer. The greatest difference is observable in the cones; for these are no more than about an inch in length, and the scales are closely placed. In the cones, indeed, consists the difference of these three sorts: those of the white species are of a very light brown colour; those of the red species more of a nut-brown or reddish colour; and those of the black species of a dark or blackish colour. Besides this, there is scarcely any material difference; though it is observable, that this trifling variation seems to be pretty constant in the plants raised from the like seeds. These sorts will often flower, and produce cones when only about five or six feet high; and indeed look then very beautiful: but this is a sign of weaknesses in the plant, which it does not often fairly get over.\n\n7. The pinus balsamea, or hemlock fir, a native of Virginia and Canada, possesses as little beauty as any of the fir tribe; though, being rather scarce in proportion, it is deemed valuable. It is called by some the yew-leaved fir, from the resemblance of the leaves to those of the yew-tree. It is a tree of low growth, with but few branches; and these are long and slender, and spread abroad without order. The leaves do not garnish the branches...\nPinus branches so plentifully as those of any other sort of fir. The cones are very small and rounded; they are about half an inch long; and the scales are loosely arranged. We receive these cones from America, by which we raise the plants; though this caution should be given to the planter, that this tree is fond of moist rich ground, and in such a kind of soil will make the greatest progress.\n\n8. The *pinus orientalis*, or oriental fir, a native of the East, is a low but elegant tree. The leaves are very short, and nearly square. The fruit is exceeding small, and hangs downward; and the whole tree makes an agreeable variety with the other kinds.\n\n9. The *abies* Lord Weymouth's pine, or North American white pine. This grows sometimes to the height of 100 feet and upwards, and is highly valued on account of its beauty. The bark of the tree is very smooth and delicate, especially when young; the leaves are long and slender, five growing out of one sheath; the branches are pretty closely garnished with them, and thus make a fine appearance. The cones are long, slender, and very loose, opening with the first warmth of the spring; so that if they are not gathered in winter, the scales open and let out the seeds. The wood of this sort is esteemed for making masts for ships. In Queen Anne's time there was a law made for the preservation of these trees, and for the encouragement of their growth in America. Within these last 50 years they have been propagated in Britain in considerable plenty.\n\nWith respect to the culture of this species, Mr Hanbury, after some more general directions, continues thus, \"I have known gentlemen, who, in attempting to raise these trees, have seen the young plants go off without perceiving the cause; and the more watering and pains they have taken, have found the plants perish in this way more and more, to their great mortification and afflamentment. In the spring following these plants should be pricked out in beds half a foot under each way; and here they may stand two years, when they may be either finally planted out, or removed into the nursery, at the distance of one foot under, and two feet in the rows. If care has been taken of them in the nursery, they may be removed at a considerable height with great assurance of success: for it is much easier to make this pine grow than any of the other sorts: so that where they are wanted for ornament in parks, open places, &c., a show of them may be made in a little time.\n\n\"The soil the Weymouth pine delights in most is a sandy loam; but it likes other soils of an inferior nature: and although it is not generally to be planted on all lands like the Scotch fir, yet I have seen it luxuriant and healthy, making strong shoots, on blue and red clays, and other sorts of strong ground. On stony and flat ground, likewise, I have seen some very fine trees; so that I believe whoever is desirous of having plantations of this pine, need not be curious in the choice of his ground.\"\n\n10. The *pinus taeda*, or swamp-pine, is a tall evergreen tree, a native of the swamps of Virginia and Canada. There are several varieties of this genus which Hanbury enumerates and describes: such as, 1st, The three-leaved American swamp-pine. 2d, The two-leaved American pine. 3d, The yellow American pine, the yellow tough pine, and the tough pine of the plains; among which there is but little variety. 4th, The battard pine. 5th, The frankincense pine. And 6th, The dwarf pine.\n\n\"There are (continues our author) many other sorts of American pines, which we receive from thence with the like cant names of those of the above, which I have chosen to retain, as they will probably be continued to be sent over; and that the gardener receiving them as such may best know what to do with them. In many of those sorts I see at present no material difference; so I am induced to think they are the same, sent over with different names. Some of the sorts above-mentioned differ in very few respects; but I have chosen to mention them, as a pedon may be supplied with the seeds from Pennsylvania, Jersey, Virginia, Carolina, &c., where they all grow naturally; and having once obtained the seeds, and from them plants, they will become pleasing objects of his nicest observations.\"\n\n11. The *pinus cedrus*, ranked by Tournefort and others under larix, famous for its duration, is that popularly called by us the cedar of Lebanon, by the ancients *cedrus magna* or the great cedar; also *cedrela*, *cedrata*; and sometimes the Phoenician or Syrian cedar, from the country where it grows in its greatest perfection. It is a coniferous evergreen, of the biggest sort, bearing large roundish cones of smooth scales, standing erect, the leaves being small, narrow, and thick set.\u2014They sometimes counterfeit cedar, by dyeing wood of a reddish hue: but the smell discovers the cheat, that of true cedar being very aromatic. In some places, the wood of the cajou-tree passes under the name of cedar, on account of its reddish colour and its aromatic smell, which somewhat resemble that of fantal. Cedar-wood is reputed almost immortal and incorruptible; a prerogative which it owes chiefly to its bitter taste, which the worms cannot endure. For this reason it was that the ancients used cedar tablets to write upon, especially for things of importance, as appears from that expression of Periurus, *Et cedra ligna locuitur*. A juice was also drawn from cedar, with which they smeared their books and writings, or other matters, to preserve them from rotting; which is alluded to by Horace: by means of which it was, that Numa's books, written on papyrus, were preserved entire to the year 535, as we are informed by Pliny.\n\nSolomon's temple, as well as his palace, were both of this wood. That prince gave King Hiram several cities for the cedars he had furnished him on these occasions. Cortes is said to have erected a palace at Mexico, in which were 7000 beams of cedar, most of them 120 feet long, and 12 in circumference, as we are informed by Herrera. Some tell us of a cedar felled in Cyprus 130 feet long, and 18 in diameter. It was used for the main-mast in the galley of King Demetrius. Le Bruyn affirms us, that the two biggest he saw on Mount Lebanon, measured, one of them 57 palms, and the other 47, in circumference. In the temple of Apollo at Utiaca, there were cedar trees near 2000 years old; which yet were nothing to that beam in an oratory of Diana at Seguntum in Spain, said to have been brought thither 2000 years before the destruction of Troy. Cedar is of so dry a nature, that it will not endure to be fastened with iron nails, from which it usually shrinks; so that they commonly fasten it with pins of the same wood.\"\nThe statue (says Hanbury) of the great goddess at Ephesus was made of this material; and, if this tree abounded with us in great plenty, it might have a principal share in our most superb edifices. The ethereal constantly emitted from its wood are said to purify the air, and make rooms wholesome. Chapels and places set apart for religious duties, being wainscoted with this wood, inspire the worshippers with a more solemn awe. It is not obnoxious to worms; and emits an oil which will preserve cloth or books from worms or corruption. The sawdust will preserve human bodies from putrefaction; and is therefore said to be plentifully used in the rites of embalming, where practised.\n\nIt is remarkable that this tree is not to be found as a native in any other part of the world than Mount Libanus, as far as hath yet been discovered. What we find mentioned in Scripture of the lofty cedars can nowise applicable to the common growth of this tree; since, from the experience we have of those now growing in England, as also from the testimony of several travellers who have visited those few remaining trees on Mount Libanus, they are not inclined to grow very lofty, but on the contrary extend their branches very far; to which the allusion made by the Psalmist agrees very well, when he is describing the flourishing state of a people, and says, \"They shall spread their branches like the cedar-tree.\"\n\nRauwolf, in his Travels, says, there were not at that time (i.e. anno 1574) upon Mount Libanus more than 26 trees remaining, 24 of which stood in a circle; and the other two, which stood at a small distance, had their branches almost confused with age; nor could he find any younger tree coming up to succeed them, though he looked about diligently for some. These trees (he says) were growing at the foot of a small hill, on the top of the mountains, and amongst the snow. Those having very large branches, commonly bend the tree to one side, but are extended to a great length, and in so delicate and pleasant order, as if they were trimmed and made even with great diligence, by which they are easily distinguished, at a great distance, from fir-trees. The leaves (continues he) are very like to those of the larch-tree, growing close together in little branches upon small brown thorns.\n\nMaundrel, in his Travels, says, there were but 16 large trees remaining when he visited the mountain, some of which were of a prodigious bulk, but that there were many more young ones of a smaller size: he measured one of the largest, and found it to be 12 yards six inches in girth, and yet found, and 37 yards in the spread of its boughs. At about five or six yards from the ground it was divided into five limbs, each of which was equal to a great tree. What Maundrel hath related was confirmed by a gentleman who was there in the year 1722, with this difference only, viz. in the directions of the branches of the largest tree, which he measured, and found to be 22 yards diameter. Now, whether Mr Maundrel meant 37 yards in circumference of the spreading branches, or the diameter of them, cannot be determined by his words; yet either of them well agrees with this last account.\n\nThere is another species, viz. the larch tree, which the old botanists ranked under larix, with deciduous leaves, and oval obtuse cones. It grows naturally upon the Alps and Apennines, and of late has been very much propagated in Britain. It is of quick growth, and the trunk rises to 50 feet or more; the branches are slender, their ends generally hanging downward, and are garnished with long narrow leaves which arise in clusters from one point, spreading open above like the hairs of a painter's brush; they are of a light green, and fall away in autumn. In the month of April the male flowers appear, which are disposed in form of small cones; the female flowers are collected into oval obtuse cones, which in some species have bright purple tops, and in others they are white; these differences are accidental; the cones are about an inch long, obtuse at their points; the scales are smooth, and lie over each other; under each scale there are generally lodged two seeds, which have wings. There are other two varieties of this tree, one of which is a native of America, and the other of Siberia. The cones of the American kind which have been brought to Britain seem in general to be larger than those of the common sort.\n\nMany encomiums (says Hanbury when speaking of this species) have been bestowed on the timber of the larch; and we find such a favourable account of it in ancient authors, as should induce us to think it would be proper for almost any use. Evelyn recites a story of Witten, a Dutch writer, that a ship built of this timber and cypress had been found in the Numidian sea, twelve fathoms under water, sound and entire, and reduced to such a hardness as to resist the sharpest tool, after it had lain submerged above 1490 years. Certain it is this is an excellent wood for ship and house-building. At Venice this wood is frequently used in building their houses, as well as in Switzerland, where these trees abound; so that, without all doubt, the larch excels for masts for ships, or beams for houses, doors, windows, &c., particularly as it is said to resist the worm.\n\nIn Switzerland (A) their houses are covered with boards of this wood cut out a foot square; and, as it emits a resinous substance, it so diffuses itself into every joint and crevice, and becomes so compact and close, as well as so hardened by the air, as to render the covering proof against all weather. But, as such covering for houses would cause great devastation in case of fire, the buildings\n\n(A) \"Between Bex and Bevieux (says Coxe in his Travels in Switzerland), I observed the larch in great plenty. Painters, from the time of Pliny to that of Raphael, trusted their works to this wood, which the Roman naturalist titles immortale lignum. The wood is reckoned excellent for all works which are to lie under water; and the borderers on the lake of Geneva prefer it for building their vessels. In these parts I saw most beautiful woods of chestnut. Haller says that they extend some leagues; he also informs us, that they are found in other parts of Switzerland, and even in desert places in some of the transalpine parts. Accident must have brought them thither, as it appears from Pliny that these trees were first introduced into Europe from Sardis.\"\nbuildings are confined to a limited distance by an order of police from the magistrates. The wood when first laid on the houses, is said to be very white; but this colour, in two or three years is changed, by means of the sun and rain, to a black, which appears like a smooth shining varnish.\"\n\nOf the common larch there are several varieties. The flowers which the commonest sort exhibits early in the spring are of a delicate red colour; another sort produces white flowers at the same season, and these have a delightful effect among those of the red sort; whilst another, called the Black Newfoundland larix, increases the variety, though by an aspect little differing from the others. There are also larches with greenish flowers, pale red, &c., all of which are accidental varieties from seeds. These varieties are easily distinguished, even when out of blow: the young shoots of the white-flowering larch are of the lightest green, and the cones when ripe are nearly white. The red flowering larch has its shoots of a reddish cast, and the cones are of a brown colour; whilst the cones and shoots of the black Newfoundland larch are in the same manner proportionally tinged. The cones, which are a very great ornament to several sorts of the pines, are very little to these. Their chief beauty consists in the manner of their growth, the nature and beauty of their pencilled leaves and fair flowers; for the cones that succeed them are small, of a whitish, a reddish, or a blackish-brown colour, and make no figure.\n\nThe pinus cedrus and pinus larix are propagated by sowing in March on a bed of light earth exposed to the morning sun. The seed must be covered half an inch thick with fine light earth, and the beds watered at times when the weather is dry. In about six weeks the plants will appear; they must at this time be carefully guarded from the birds, shaded from the sun and winds, and kept very clear of weeds. In the latter end of April the following year, they may be removed into beds of fresh earth, placing them at ten inches distance every way. They are to be kept here two years, and such of them as seem to bend must be tied up to a stake to keep them upright. They may afterwards be planted in the places where they are to remain. They thrive well on the sides of barren hills, and make a very pretty figure there.\n\nRespecting the uses of this tree, Dr Pallas, in his Flora Rossica, informs us, that if it is burnt, and the wood consumed, the internal part of the wood distils copiously a drying reddish gum, a little less glutinous than gum arabic, somewhat of a resinous taste, but wholly soluble in water. At the instigation of M. Kinder, this gum has lately been sold in the Russian shops under the name of gummi Orenburgensis, but which our author thinks should be called gummi Uraliensis or laricii. It is eaten by the Wogulis as a dainty, and is said to be nutritious and antiseptic. Some manna was gathered from the green leaves, but it could never be condensed. The Russians use the boletus laricius as an emetic in intermittents, and to check the leucorrhea. At Bafchir and Siberia the inhabitants sprinkle the dry powder on the wounds of oxen and horses, as a detergent and anthelmintic. The nuts of the pinus cembra, the same author affirms, are eaten as luxuries in Russia, and are even exported with the same view. The unripe cones give a very fragrant oil, termed balsamic. The inhabitants of Siberia use the tender tops, and even the bark rubbed off in the spring, as an antiseptic. The kernels of the nuts of the amygdalus nana give a very pleasing flavour to brandy; and, when pressed, afford a bitter oil in large quantities. The way of destroying the bitter is by digesting it in the sun with spirit of wine, and it then becomes sweet and extremely agreeable.\n\nFrom the larch-tree is extracted what is erroneously called Venice turpentine. This substance, or natural balsam, flows at first without incision; when it has done dropping, the poor people who wait in the fir woods make incisions at about two or three feet from the ground into the trunks of the trees, into which they fix narrow troughs about 20 inches long. The end of these troughs is hollowed like a ladle; and in the middle is a small hole bored for the turpentine to run into the receiver which is placed below it. As the gummy substance runs from the trees, it passes along the sloping gutter or trough to the ladle, and from thence runs through the holes into the receiver. The people who gather it visit the trees morning and evening from the end of May to September, to collect the turpentine out of the receivers. When it flows out of the tree, Venice turpentine is clear like water, and of a yellowish white; but, as it grows older, it thickens and becomes of a citron colour. It is procured in the greatest abundance in the neighbourhood of Lyons, and in the valley of St Martin near St Lucern in Switzerland.\n\nThough we have already noticed the manner of cultivating some of the particular species of this genus, and have also remarked the uses of some of them, we shall finish the article with a few general observations on the culture and uses of the whole.\n\nCulture. All the sorts of pines are propagated by seeds produced in hard woody cones. The way to get the seeds out of these cones is to lay them before a gentle fire, which will cause the cells to open, and then the seeds may be easily taken out. If the cones are kept entire, the seeds will remain good for some years; so that the surest way of preserving them is to let them remain in the cones till the time for sowing the seeds. If the cones are kept in a warm place in summer, they will open and emit the seeds; but if they are not exposed to the heat, they will remain close for a long time. The best season for sowing the pines is about the end of March. When the seeds are sown, the place should be covered with nets to keep off the birds; otherwise, when the plants begin to appear with the hulk of the seed on the top of them, the birds will peck off the tops, and thus destroy them.\n\nUses. From the first species is extracted the common turpentine, much used by farriers, and from which is drawn the oil of that name. The process of making pitch, tar, resin, and turpentine, from these trees, is very familiar. In the spring time, when the sap is most free in running, they pare off the bark of the pine tree, to make the sap run down into a hole which they cut at the bottom to receive it. In the way, as it runs down, it leaves a white matter like cream, but a little thicker. This is very different from all the kinds of resin and turpentine in use, and it is generally sold to be used in the making of flamb\u00e9aux instead of white bees wax. The matter that is received in the hole at the bottom is taken up with ladles, and put in a large basket. A great part of this immediately runs through, and this is the com-\nmon turpentine. This is received into stone or earthen pots, and is ready for sale. The thicker matter, which remains in the basket, they put into a common alembic, adding a large quantity of water. They distil this as long as any oil is seen floating upon the water. This oil they separate from the surface in large quantities, and this is the common oil or spirit of turpentine. The remaining matter at the bottom of the still is common yellow resin. When they have thus obtained all that they can from the sap of the tree, they cut it down, and hewing the wood into billets, they fill a pit dug in the earth with these billets, and, setting them on fire, there runs from them, while they are burning, a black thick matter. This naturally falls to the bottom of the pit, and this is the tar. The top of the pit is covered with tiles, to keep in the heat; and there is at the bottom a little hole, out of which the tar runs like oil. If this hole be made too large, it sets the whole quantity of the tar on fire; but, if small enough, it runs quietly out.\n\nThe tar, being thus made, is put up in barrels; and if it be to be made into pitch, they put it into large boiling vessels, without adding anything to it. It is then suffered to boil a while, and being then let out, is found when cold to be what we call pitch.\n\nA decoction of the nuts or seeds of the first species in milk, or of the extremities of the branches pulled in spring, is said, with a proper regimen, to cure the most inveterate scurvy. The wood of this species is not valued; but that of the Scots pine is superior to any of the rest. It is observable of the Scots pine, that when planted in bogs, or in a moist soil, though the plants make great progress, yet the wood is white, soft, and little esteemed; but when planted in a dry soil, though the growth of the trees is there very slow, yet the wood is proportionably better. Few trees have been applied to more uses than this. The tallest and straightest are formed by nature for masts to our navy. The timber is resinous, durable, and applicable to numberless domestic purposes, such as flooring and wainscoting of rooms, making of beds, chests, tables, boxes, &c. From the trunk and branches of this, as well as most others of the pine tribe, tar and pitch is obtained. By incision, bar-ras, Burgundy pitch, and turpentine, are acquired and prepared. The resinous roots are dug out of the ground in many parts of the Highlands, and, being divided into small splinters, are used by the inhabitants to burn, instead of candles.\u2014At Loch-Broom, in Ross-shire the fishermen make ropes of the inner bark; but hard necessity has taught the inhabitants of Sweden, Lapland, and Kamtchatka, to convert the same into bread. To effect this, they, in the spring season, make choice of the tallest and fairest trees; then stripping off carefully the outer bark, they collect the soft, white, succulent interior bark, and dry it in the shade. When they have occasion to use it, they first toast it at the fire, then grind, and after steeping the flour in warm water to take off the resinous taste, they make it into thin cakes, which are baked for use. On this strange food the poor inhabitants are sometimes constrained to live for a whole year; and, we are told, through custom, become at last even fond of it. Linnaeus remarks, that this same bark-bread will fatten swine; and humanity obliges us to wish, that men might never be reduced to the necessity of robbing them of such a food. The interior bark, of which the above-mentioned bread is made, the Swedish boys frequently peel off the trees in the spring, and eat raw with greedy appetite. From the cones of this tree is prepared a diuretic oil, like the oil of turpentine, and a resinous extract, which has similar virtues with the balsam of Peru. An infusion or tea of the buds is highly commended as an antiscorbutic. The farina, or yellow powder, of the male flowers, is sometimes in the spring carried away by the winds, in such quantities, where the trees abound, as to alarm the ignorant with the notion of its raining bitumen. The tree lives to a great age; Linnaeus affirms to 400 years.","sp":178,"ep":183},{"h":"PIONEERS","t":"in the art of war, are such as are commanded in from the country, to march with an army for mending the ways, for working on intrenchments and fortifications, and for making mines and approaches.

Our regiments of infantry and cavalry have three or four pioneers each, provided with aprons, hatchets, saws, spades, and pick-axes. Each pioneer must have an axe, a saw, and an apron; a cap with a leather crown, and a black bearskin front, on which is to be the king's crest in white, on a red ground; and the number of the regiment is to be on the back part of it.","sp":183,"ep":183},{"h":"PIPE","t":"in building, &c., a canal, or conduit, for the conveyance of water and other liquids. Pipes for water, water-engines, &c., are usually of lead, iron, earth, or wood: the latter are usually made of oak or elder. Those of iron are cast in forges; their usual length is about two feet and a half; several of these are commonly fastened together by means of four screws at each end, with leather or old hat between them, to stop the water. Those of earth are made by the potters; these are fitted into one another, one end being always made wider than the other. To join them closer, and prevent their breaking, they are covered with tow and pitch: their length is usually about that of the iron pipes. The wooden pipes are trees bored with large iron augers, of different sizes, beginning with a leaf, and then proceeding with a larger successively; the first being pointed, the rest being formed like spoons, increasing in diameter, from one to six inches or more: they are fitted into the extremities of each other (as represented fig. 2), and are sold by the foot.\n\nWooden pipes are bored as follows. The machine represented fig. 1, is put in motion by the wheel A, which is moved by a current of water; upon the axle of this wheel is a cog-wheel B, which causes the lanterns C, D, to turn horizontally, whose common axis is consequently in a perpendicular direction. The lantern D turns at the same time two cog-wheels, E and F: the first, E, which is vertical, turns the auger which bores the wood; and the second, F, which is horizontal, causes the carriage bearing the piece to advance by means of the arms H, I, which take hold of the notches.\nPipes in the wheel K. The first, H, by means of the notches, draws the wheel towards F; and the other, I, pushes the under-polt of the wheel in an opposite direction; both which motions tend to draw the carriage towards F, and consequently cause the augre to pierce the wood. The augre being from 9 to 12 feet in length, and of a proportionable bigness, it will be necessary to have two pieces, as L, L, to support its weight, and cause it to enter the piece to be bored with the same uniformity.\n\nFor the construction of leaden pipes, see the article PLUMBERY.\n\nAir-Pipes.

See Trigla, Ichthyology Index.\n\nPiper, Pepper; a genus of plants belonging to the Piper dandria clas. See Botany Index. There are 25 species, of which the most remarkable is the firiboa, with oval, heart-shaped, nerv\u00e8d leaves, and reflexed spikes. This is the plant which produces the pepper so much used in food. It is a shrub whose root is small, fibrous, and flexible; it rises into a stem, which requires a tree or prop to support it. Its wood has the same sort of knots as the vine; and when it is dry, it exactly resembles the vine-branch. The leaves, which have a strong smell and a pungent taste, are of an oval shape; but they diminish towards the extremity, and terminate in a point. From the flower-buds, which are white, and are sometimes placed in the middle and sometimes at the extremity of the branches, are produced small berries resembling those of the currant tree. Each of these contains between 20 and 30 corns of pepper; they are commonly gathered in October, and exposed to the sun seven or eight days. The fruit which was green at first, and afterwards red, when stripped of its covering affirms the appearance it has when we see it. The largest, heaviest, and least shrivelled, is the best.\n\nThe pepper plants flourishes in the island of Java, Sumatra (a), and Ceylon, and more particularly on the Malabar coast. It is not sown, but planted; and great nicety is required in the choice of the shoots. It produces no fruit till the end of three years; but bears plentifully the three succeeding years, that some plants yield between five and seven pounds of pepper. The bark then begins to shrink; and the shrub declines so fast, that in 12 years time it ceases bearing.\n\nThe culture of pepper is not difficult: it is sufficient to plant it in a rich soil, and carefully to pull up the weeds that grow in great abundance round its roots, especially the three first years. As the sun is highly necessary to the growth of the pepper plant, when it is ready to bear, the trees that support it must be lopped to prevent their shade from injuring the fruit. When the season is over, it is proper to crop the head of the plant. Without this precaution, there would be too much wood, and little fruit.\n\nThe pepper exported from Malabar, which was formerly entirely in the hands of the Portuguese, and was afterwards divided between the Dutch, British, and French, amounted to about 10,000,000 weight. Betel, or betle, is a species of this genus. See Betel. It is a creeping and climbing plant like the ivy; and its leaves a good deal resemble those of the citron, though they are longer and narrower at the extremity. It grows in all parts of India, but thrives best in moist places. The natives cultivate it as we do the vine, placing props for it to run and climb upon; and it is a common practice to plant it against the tree which bears the areca-nut.\n\nAt all times of the day, and even in the night, the Indians chew the leaves of the betel, the bittermels of which is corrected by the areca that is wrapped up in them. There is constantly mixed with it the chimam,\n\n(a) See a copious account of the mode of cultivating pepper in Sumatra, in Mr Marsten's History of Sumatra, or in the New Annual Register for 1783, p. 147.\na kind of burnt lime made of shells. The rich frequently add perfumes, either to gratify their vanity or their sensuality.\n\nIt would be thought a breach of politeness among the Indians to take leave for any long time, without presenting each other with a pur\u00e9e of betel. It is a pledge of friendship that relieves the pain of absence. No one dares to speak to a superior unless his mouth is perfumed with betel; it would even be rude to neglect this precaution with an equal. The women of gallantry are the most lavish in the use of betel, as being a powerful incentive to love. Betel is taken after meals; it is chewed during a visit; it is offered when you meet, and when you separate; in short, nothing is to be done without betel. If it is prejudicial to the teeth, it afflicts and strengthens the stomach. At least, it is a general fashion that prevails throughout India.\n\nThe piper amalago, or black pepper, and the piper ingeale, or long pepper of Jamaica, with some other species, are indigenous, and known by the names of joint wood, or peppery elder. The first bears a small spike, on which are attached a number of small seeds of the size of mustard. The whole of the plant has the exact taste of the East India black pepper. The long pepper bush grows taller than the amalago. The leaves are broad, smooth, and shining. The fruit is similar to the long pepper of the shops, but smaller. The common people in Jamaica season their messes with the black pepper. To preserve both, the fruit may be slightly scalded when green, then dried, and wrapped in paper. Perhaps hereafter they may be deemed worthy of attention.","sp":184,"ep":185},{"h":"PIQUET","t":"or Picket, a celebrated game at cards, much in use throughout the polite world.\n\nIt is played between two persons, with only 32 cards; all the duces, threes, fours, fives, and fixes, being set aside.\n\nIn reckoning at this game, every card goes for the number it bears, as a ten for ten; only all count cards go for ten, and the ace for eleven; and the usual game is one hundred up. In playing, the ace wins the king, the king the queen, and so down.\n\nTwelve cards are dealt round, usually by two and two; which done, the remainder are laid in the middle: if one of the gamesters finds he has not a court card in his hand, he is to declare he has carte-blanche, and tell how many cards he will lay out, and define the other to discard, that he may show his game, and satisfy his antagonist that the carte-blanche is real; for which he reckons ten.\n\nEach person discards, i.e., lays aside a certain number of his cards, and takes in a like number from the stock. The first of the eight cards may take three, four, or five; the dealer all the remainder, if he pleases.\n\nAfter discarding, the eldest hand examines what suit he has most cards of; and reckoning how many points he has in that suit, if the other have not so many in that or any other suit, he tells one for every ten of that suit. He who thus reckons most is said to win the point.\n\nThe point being over, each examines what sequences he has of the same suit, viz., how many tierces, or fe-\n\nquences of threes, quartes or fours, quintes or fives, six-\nemes, or fixes, &c. For a tierce they reckon three\npoints, for a quarte four, for a quinte fifteen, for a fixieme\nsixteen, &c. And the several sequences are distinguished\nin dignity by the cards they begin from: thus ace\nking, and queen, are called tierce major; king, queen,\nand knave, tierce to a king; knave, ten, and nine,\ntierce to a knave, &c. and the best tierce, quarte, or\nquinte, i.e., that which takes its descent from the best\ncard, prevails, so as to make all the others in that\nhand good, and destroy all those in the other hand.\nIn like manner, a quarte in one hand sets aside a tierce\nin the other.\n\nThe sequences over, they proceed to examine how\nmany aces, kings, queens, knaves, and tens, each\nholds; reckoning for every three of any sort, three:\nbut here too, as in sequences, he that with the same\nnumber of threes has one that is higher than any the\nother has, e.g., three aces, has all his others made\ngood hereby, and his adversary's all set aside. But four\nof any sort, which is called a quatorze, always sets\naside three.\n\nAll the game in hand being thus reckoned, the eldest\nproceeds to play, reckoning one for every card he plays\nabove a nine, and the other follows him in the suit; and\nthe highest card of the suit wins the trick. Note, un-\nless a trick be won with a card above a nine (except the\nlast trick), nothing is reckoned for it, though the trick\nserves afterwards towards winning the cards; and that\nhe who plays last does not reckon for his cards unless he\nwins the trick.\n\nThe cards being played out, he that has most tricks\nreckons ten for winning the cards. If they have tricks\nalike, neither reckons anything. The deal being fin-\nished, and each having marked up his game, they pro-\nceed to deal again as before, cutting afresh each time for\nthe deal.\n\nIf both parties be within a few points of being up, the\ncarte-blanche is the first thing that reckons, then the\npoint, then the sequences, then the quatorzes or threes,\nthen the tenth cards.\n\nHe that can reckon 30 in hand by carte-blanche,\npoints, quintes, &c., without playing, before the other\nhas reckoned anything, reckons 90 for them; and\nthis is called a repique. If he reckons above 30, he\nreckons to many above 90. If he can make up 30,\npart in hand and part play, ere the other has told any-\nthing, he reckons for them 60. And this is called\na pique.

To find at piquet the prob-\nability which the dealer has for taking one ace or more\nin three cards, he having none in his hand. He con-\ncludes from his computation, that it is 29 to 28 that\nthe dealer takes one ace or more. 2. To find at piquet\nthe probability which the eldest has of taking an ace\nor more in five cards, he having no ace in his hand.\nAnswer: 232 to 91, or 5 to 2, nearly. 3. To find\nat piquet the probability which the eldest hand has of\ntaking an ace and a king in five cards, he having none\nin his hand. Answer: the odds against the eldest hand\ntaking an ace and a king are $331$ to $315$, or $21$ to $20$ nearly.\n\n4. To find at piquet the probability of having 12 cards dealt to, without king, queen, or knaves, which case is commonly called cartes-blanches. Answer; the odds against cartes-blanches are $1791$ to $1$ nearly.\n\n5. To find how many different sets, essentially different from one another, one may have at piquet before taking in. Answer; $28,967,278$. This number falls short of the sum of all the distinct combinations, whereby 12 cards may be taken out of 32, this number being $225,792,840$; but it must be considered that in that number several sets of the same import, but differing in suit, might be taken, which would not introduce an essential difference among the sets.

On the back it has only one long fin, which is supported by rigid and prickly spines. This fin can depress at pleasure, and sink within a cavity made for it in the back. Its scales are of a silvery white colour; it is wholesome and well tasted. Pira bebe is the name of the milvus, or kite-fish. Pira coaba is an American fish of the trutaceous kind, of a very delicate flavour. It grows to the length of 12 inches; its nose is pointed, and its mouth large, but without teeth; the upper jaw is longer than the under one, and hangs over like a cartilaginous prominence; its eyes are very large, and its tail is forked; under each of the gill fins there is a beard made of six white filaments, and covered with silvery scales. Pira jurumenbeca is a Brazilian fish, otherwise called bocca molle. It lives in the muddy bottom of the American seas, and is a long-bodied not flat-tailed fish. It grows to a great size, being found nine, and sometimes even ten or eleven, feet long, and two feet and a half thick. It has one long fin on the back, the anterior part of which is thin and pellucid. There is also a cavity on the back, as in the pira acanaga, into which the fin can be depressed at pleasure; the tail is not forked, and the scales are all of a silvery colour and brightish. The fish is very well tasted; the pira pixanga is another Brazilian fish of the turdus or waffle kind, and called by some the gutujoche. It is generally about four or five inches long; its mouth is pretty large, and furnished with very small and very sharp teeth; its head is small, but its eyes are large and prominent, the pupil being of a fine turmoule colour, and the iris yellow and red in a variety of shades. The coverings of the gills end in a triangular figure, and are terminated by a short spine or prickle; its scales are very small, and so evenly arranged, and closely laid on the flesh, that it is very smooth to the touch; its tail is rounded at the end; its whole body, head, tail, and fins, are of a pale yellow colour, variegated all over with very beautiful blood-coloured spots; these are round, and of the bignets of hemp-feed on the back and sides, and something larger on the belly; the fins are all spotted in the same manner, and are all marked with an edge of red.

III. c. 2, it is held to be only felony in a subject. Formerly it was only cognizable by the admiralty courts, which proceed by the rules of the civil law.

III. c. 7, if any natural-born subject commits any act of hostility upon the high seas, against others of his majesty's subjects, under colour of a commission from any foreign power; this, though it would only be an act of war in an alien, shall be construed piracy in a subject. And farther, any commander, or other seafaring person, betraying his trust, and running away with any ship, boat, ordnance, ammunition, or goods; or yielding them up voluntarily to a pirate; or confining to do these acts; or any person assaulting the commander of a vessel, to hinder him from fighting in defence of his ship; or confining him, or causing or endeavouring to cause a revolt on board; shall, for each of these offenses, be adjudged a pirate, felon, and robber, and shall suffer death, whether he be principal, or merely accessory by setting forth such pirates, or abetting them before the fact, or receiving or concealing them or their goods after it. And the statute 4 Geo. I. c. 11, expressly excludes the principals from the benefit of clergy. By the statute 8 Geo. I. c. 24, the trading with known pirates, or furnishing them with ammunition, or fitting out any vessel for that purpose, or in anywise consulting, combining, confederating, or corresponding with them; or the forcibly boarding any merchant vessel, though without seizing or carrying her off, and destroying or throwing any of the goods overboard; shall be deemed piracy: and such accessories to piracy as are described by the statute of King William are declared to be principal pirates; and all pirates convicted by virtue of this act are made felons without benefit of clergy. By the same statutes also, (to encourage the defence of merchant-vessels against pirates), the commanders or seamen wounded, and the widows of such seamen as are slain, in any piratical engagement, shall be entitled to a bounty to be divided among them, not exceeding one-fiftieth part of the value of the cargo on board: and such wounded seamen shall be entitled to the pension of Greenwich hospital; which no other seamen are, except only such as have served in a ship of war. And if the commander shall behave cowardly, by not defending the ship, if she carry guns or arms; or shall discharge the mariners from fighting, so that the ship falls into the hands of pirates; such commander shall forfeit all his wages, and suffer six months imprisonment. Lastly, by statute 18 Geo. II. c. 30, any natural-born subject or denizen, who in time of war shall commit hostilities at sea against any of his fellow-subjects, or shall assist an enemy on that element, is liable to be tried and convicted as a pirate.","sp":187,"ep":187},{"h":"PIRAEUS PORTUS","t":"in Ancient Geography, a celebrated port to the west of Athens, consisting naturally of three harbours or basins, (Thucydides); which lay neglected, till Themistocles put the Athenians on making it a commodious port, (Nepos); the Phalerus, a small port, and not far from the city, being what they used before that time, (Paufanias, Nepos). Piraeus was originally a village of Attica, (Paufanias), an island, (Strabo); and though distant 40 stadia from Athens, was joined to it by two long walls, (Thucydides), and itself locked or walled round, (Nepos): A very commodious and safe harbour. The whole of its compass was 60 stadia, including the Munichia. Not far from the Piraeus stood the sepulchre of Themistocles; whither his friends conveyed his bones from Magnesia, into the Hither Asia, (Cicero, Plutarch, Paufanias). The entrance of the Piraeus is narrow, and formed by two rocky points, one belonging to the promontory of Eetion, the other to that of Alcimus. Within were three stations for shipping; Kantharos, so named from a hero; Aphrodium, from a temple of Venus; and Zea, the refort of vessels laden with grain. By it was a demos or borough town of the same name before the time of Themistocles, who recommended the exchanging its triple harbour for the single one of Phalerum, both as more capacious and as better situated for navigators. The wall was begun by him when archon, in the second year of the 75th Olympiad, 477 years before Christ; and afterwards he urged the Athenians to complete it as the importance of the place deserved. This whole fortification was of hewn stone, without cement or other material, except lead and iron, which were used to hold together the exterior ranges or facings. It was so wide that loaded carts could pass on it in different directions, and it was 40 cubits high, which was about half what he had designed.\n\nThe Piraeus, as Athens flourished, became the common emporium of all Greece. Hippodamus an architect, celebrated, besides other monuments of his genius, as the inventor of many improvements in house-building, was employed to lay out the ground. Five porticoes, which uniting formed the Long Portico, were erected by the ports. Here was an agora or market-place, and, farther from the sea, another called Hippodamia. By the vessels were dwellings for the mariners. A theatre was opened, temples were raised, and the Piraeus, which surpassed the city in utility, began to equal it in dignity. The cavities and windings of Munichia, natural and artificial, were filled with houses; and the whole settlement, comprehending Phalerum and the ports of the Piraeus, with the ar\u00e9na, the storehouses, the famous armory of which Philo was the architect, and the fleets for 300, and afterwards 400, triremes, resembled the city of Rhodes, which had been planned by the same Hippodamus. The ports, on the commencement of the Peloponnesian...\nPiraeus, Peloponnesian war, were secured with chains. Centinels were stationed, and the Piraeus was carefully guarded.\n\nThe Piraeus was reduced with great difficulty by Sulla, who demolished the walls, and set fire to the armory and arsenals. In the civil war it was in a defenseless condition. Calenus, lieutenant to Caesar, seized it, invested Athens, and ravaged the territory. Strabo, who lived under the emperors Augustus and Tiberius, observes, that the many wars had destroyed the long walls, with the fortresses of Munychia, and had contracted the Piraeus into a small settlement by the ports and the temple of Jupiter Saviour. This fabric was then adorned with wonderful pictures, the works of illustrious artists, and on the outside with statues. In the second century, besides houses for triremes, the temple of Jupiter and Minerva remained, with their images in bronzes, and a temple of Venus, a portico, and the tomb of Themistocles.\n\nThe port of the Piraeus has been named Porto Liona, from the marble lion seen in the chart, and also Porto Dracco. The lion has been described as a piece of admirable sculpture, 10 feet high, and as resting on its hinder parts. It was pierced, and, as some have conjectured, had belonged to a fountain. Near Athens, in the way to Eleusis, was another, the posture couchant; probably its companion. Both these were removed to Venice by the famous general Morosini, and are to be seen there before the arsenal. At the mouth of the port are two ruined piers. A few vessels, mostly small craft, frequent it. Some low land at the head seems an incroachment on the water. The buildings are a mean customhouse, with a few sheds; and by the shore on the east side, a warehouse belonging to the French; and a Greek monastery dedicated to St Spiridon. On the opposite side is a rocky ridge, on which are remnants of the ancient wall, and of a gateway towards Athens. By the water-edge are vestiges of building; and going from the customhouse to the city on the right hand, traces of a small theatre in the side of the hill of Munychia.","sp":186,"ep":187},{"h":"PIRATE","t":"(\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, Gr.) a sea-robbler, or an armed ship that roams the seas without any legal commission, and seizes or plunders every vessel she meets indiscriminately, whether friends or enemies.\n\nThe colours usually displayed by pirates are said to be a black field, with a death's head, a battle-axe, and hour-glass. The last instrument is generally supposed to determine the time allowed to the prisoners, whom they take, to consider whether they will join the pirates in their felonious combination, or be put to death, which is often perpetrated in the most cruel manner.\n\nAmongst the most celebrated pirates of the north is recorded Alvida, daughter of a king of the Goths named Sigaraius. She embraced this occupation to deliver herself from the violence imposed on her inclination, by a marriage with Alf, son of Sigaraius king of Denmark. She dressed herself as a man; and composed her band of rowers, and the rest of her crew, of a number of young women attired in the same manner. Amongst the first of her cruises, she touched at a place where a company\nof pirates bewailed the death of their captain. The strangers were captivated with the agreeable manners of Alvilda, and chose her for their chief. By this reinforcement she became formidable upon the sea, that Prince Alf came to engage her. She sustained his attacks for a considerable time; but, in a vigorous action, Alf boarded her vessel, and having killed the greatest part of her crew, seized the captain, namely herself; whom nevertheless he knew not, because the princess had a casque which covered her visage. Being master of her person, he removed the casque; and in spite of her disguise, instantly recognized her, and offered her his hand in wedlock.","sp":187,"ep":188},{"h":"PIRENE","t":"(Pliny); a fountain sacred to the muses, springing below the top of the Acrocorinthus, a high and steep mountain which hangs over Corinth.

He remained a long time in Armenia, where he had the happiness to bring back to the church many schismatics and Eutychians, and the patriarch himself, who had before thrown every obstacle in his way. He afterwards passed into Georgia and Persia, then into Poland, in quality of Pope Urban VIII's nuncio, in order to appease the disturbances which had been occasioned there by the disputes of the Armenians, who were very numerous in that country. Piromalli reunited them in the profession of the same faith, and observance of the same ceremonies. In his return to Italy, he was taken by some corsairs who carried him prisoner to Tunis. As soon as he was ransomed, he went to Rome, and gave an account of his mission to the pope, who conferred upon him some signal marks of his esteem. His holiness entrusted him with the revival of an Armenian Bible, and sent him again into the east, where he was promoted, in 1655, to the bishopric of Nasirvan. After having governed that church for nine years, he returned to Italy, and took the charge of the church of Bafgiano, where he died three years after in 1667. His charity, his zeal, and other virtues, did honour to the Episcopal office. There are extant of his writings, 1. Some works of Controversy and Theology. 2. Two Dictionaries; the one a Latin-Perfian, and the other an Armenian-Latin. 3. An Armenian Grammar. 4. A Directory, which is of great use in correcting Armenian books. All these works equally distinguish him for virtue and for learning.","sp":188,"ep":188},{"h":"PIRON","t":"ALEXIS, a French poet, was born at Dijon in July 1689, where his father was an apothecary, and where he passed more than 30 years in idle and destructive dissipation. He was at length obliged to quit the place of his nativity, in order to avoid the reproaches of his fellow citizens, on account of an ode which he had written, and which gave great offence. His relations not being able to give him much assistance, he supported himself at Paris by means of his pen, the strokes of which were as beautiful and fair as those of an engraver. He lived in the house of M. de Bellisle as his secretary, and afterwards with a financier, who did not know that he had a man of genius under his roof. His reputation as a writer commenced with some pieces which he published for the entertainment of the populace, and which showed strong marks of original invention; but what fully established his character in this way was his comedy intitled Metromancy, which was the best that had appeared in France since Regnard's Gamellet. This performance, in five acts, well conducted, replete with genius, wit, and humour, was acted with the greatest success upon the French stage in 1738. The author met with every attention in the capital which was due to a man of real genius, and whose flashes of wit were inexhaustible. We shall insert a few anecdotes of him, which will serve to show his character and turn of mind.\n\nIn Burgundy the inhabitants of Beaune are called the Affet de Beaune. Piron often indulged his satirical disposition at their expense. One day as he was taking a walk in the neighbourhood of that city, he diverted himself with cutting down all the thistles which he met with. When a friend asked him his reason for doing so, he replied, \"J'ai \u00e0 me plaindre des Beaunois; je leur coupe les vivres,\" i.e., \"I am sorry indeed for the Beaunois; for I am cutting down their food.\" Being told again that these people would certainly be revenged of him,\n\nAllez, (says he) Allez : je ne crains point leur impuissant courroux;\nEt quand je serais seul, je les battrais tous.\n\n\"Get you gone, get you gone: I fear not their feeble revenge; for though alone, I should beat them all.\"\n\nGoing into a theatre one time where a play was acting, he asked what it was? The Cheats of Scapin, gravely replied a young Beaunian. \"Ah! Sir, (says Piron, after thanking him), I took it to be the Cheats of Orefles.\" In the time of the play, some body addressed the company with \"Silence there, gentlemen, we don't hear.\" \"It is not at least (cried Piron) for want of ears.\" A bishop one day asked Piron, during the disputes about Jansenism, \"Did you read my mandate, Mr Piron?\" No, my lord; and you\u2014The conversation turning very warm, the bishop reminded him of the difference which birth and rank had put between them. \"Sir (says Piron), I have plainly the superiority over you at this moment; for I am in the right, and you are in the wrong.\"\u2014Voltaire's Semiramis did not meet with a very favourable reception the first time it was acted. The author finding Piron behind the scenes, asked him what he thought of his performance? \"I think (replied he) you would have been pleased that I had been the author of it.\" The performer of the character Ferdinand Cortez (the title of one of Piron's tragedies) having requested some corrections to be made on the play the first time it was acted, Piron fired at the word corrections. The player, who was deputed to wait upon the author with this request, cited the example of Voltaire, who corrected some of his pieces in order to gratify the taste of the public. \"The cases are widely different (replied Piron); Voltaire works in chequer-work, and I cast in brafs.\" If this answer be not very modest, we must allow that it does not want wit. He thought himself, if not superior, at least equal to Voltaire. Some person congratulating him on having composed the best comedy of this age, he answered, with more frankness than modesty, \"Add too, and the best tragedy.\"\nThe following verses are well known, in which he says:\n\n*En deux mots voulez-vous distinguer et connoitre*\n*Le rimeur Dijonnois et le Parisien?*\n*Le premier ne fut rien, et ne voulut rien \u00eatre;*\n*L'autre voulut tout \u00eatre, et ne fut presque rien.*\n\nWe see by these different traits that Piron had a sufficient stock of self-conceit. What helped to increase it, and make him fancy himself superior to the most celebrated of his contemporaries, was, that his company, on account of his original humour, of which he had an uncommon share, was more courted than that of Voltaire, who was otherwise too lively, too captious, and crabbed. But those who have favoured us with an account of his many witticisms in conversation, would have done more honour to his memory if they had passed over such as were either indecent or infipid. A thing often pleases over a glass of wine, which will not give the same satisfaction when it is repeated, especially if, in repeating it, you want to make it appear of some importance. Be that as it may, Piron's mischievous ingenuity was partly the cause which excluded him from the French Academy.\u2014\"I could not (said he) make thirty-nine people think as I do, and I could less think as thirty-nine do.\" He called that celebrated society very unjustly *les invalides du bel esprit*, \"the invalids of wit;\" and yet he often endeavoured to be one of those invalids. His death was hastened by a fall which he got a little before. He died the 21st of January 1773, at the age of 83. He had prepared for himself the following epitaph, in the way of an epigram:\n\n*Ci git Piron, qui ne fut rien,*\n*Pas m\u00eame acad\u00e9micien.*\n\n\"Here lies Piron, who was nothing, not even an academician.\"\n\nHis wife Maria Theresa Quenandon, who died in 1751, he describes as a sweet and most agreeable companion. They lived together for several years; and no husband ever discharged his duty with more fidelity and attention.\n\nA collection of his works appeared in 1776, in 7 vols 8vo, and 9 vols 12mo. The principal pieces are, The School of Fathers; a comedy acted in 1728 under the title of Ungrateful Sons. Callithene; a tragedy, the subject of which is taken from Juvin. The Mysterious Lover, a comedy. Gustavus and Ferdinand Cortez, two tragedies; some scenes of which discover an original genius, but the versification neither pleases the ear nor affects the heart. Metromany, a comedy. The Courtes of Tempe, an ingenious pastoral, in which the manners both of the town and country are pleasantly drawn. Some odes, poems, fables, and epigrams. In this last kind of poetry he was very successful, and he may be placed after Marot and Rousseau. There was no occasion for loading the public with 7 vols of his works; the half of that number might have sufficed. For, excepting Metromany, Gustavus, the Courtes of Tempe, some odes, about 20 epigrams, three or four fables, and some epistles, the rest are but indifferent, and have no claim to any extraordinary merit.","sp":188,"ep":189},{"h":"PISA","t":"a large town of Tuscany in Italy, situated on the river Arno, 12 miles from Florence. It was a famous republic, till subdued, first by the duke of Milan, and then by the Florentines in the year 1406. Before it lost its freedom, it is said to have contained near 150,000 inhabitants, but now it has not above 16,000 or 17,000. It was founded, we are told, by the Pisans of Peloponnesus, and afterwards became one of the 12 municipia of Tuscany. Its neighbourhood to Leghorn, which is now the chief port in the Mediterranean, though formerly of little or no note for trade, has contributed greatly to the decay of Pisa, which, however, begins to lift up its head again, under the auspices of the present grand duke, who has made it his winter residence. Between Pisa and Leghorn is a canal 16 Italian miles in length.\u2014Its territory is very fruitful; abounding in corn, wine, and fruit, and fine cattle. The houses are well built, and the streets even, broad, and well paved; but in many places overrun with grass. The university is well endowed, and has able professors, but is not in a very flourishing condition. The exchange is a stately structure, but little frequented. The grand duke's galleys are built, and commonly stationed here. This city is also the principal residence of the order of St Stephen, and the see of an archbishop. The cathedral, a large Gothic pile, contains a great number of excellent paintings and other curiosities. This church is dedicated to St Mary; is very advantageously situated in the middle of a large piazza, and built out of a great heap of wrought marble, such as pillars, pedestals, capitals, cornices, and architraves, part of the spoils which the Pisans took in their eastern expeditions, when the republic was in a flourishing condition. The roof is supported by 76 high marble pillars of different colours, and finely gilt. Both the church and the cupola are covered with lead. The choir is painted by good hands, and the floor is mosaic work. The brazen doors are curiously wrought with the history of the Old and New Testament, by Bonanno, an ancient statuary. The chapel of St Rainerius is richly adorned with gilt metals, columns of porphyry, and fine paintings. In the middle of the nave of the church you see two brazen tombs, raised upon pillars. The marble pulpit was carved by John Pifano, and the choir by Julian da Majana. Joining thereto is the altar, over which is preferred a hollow globe or vessel of marble, wherein they kept the sacrament for the new baptized, according to the opinion of Father Mabillon. In the square before the church, you see a pillar upon which is the measure of the ancient Roman talent. In the same square with the dome, stands the baptistery, a round fabric supported by fluted pillars, and remarkable for a very extraordinary echo.\n\nOn the north side of the cathedral is the burying-place, called Campo Santo, being covered with earth brought from the Holy Land. This burying-place is inclosed with a broad portico, well painted, and paved with grave stones. Here are a great many ancient tombs, among the rest that of Beatrice, mother of the countess Mathilda, with marble basso-relievos, which the Pisans brought from Greece, where you see the hunt of Meleager, which assisted Nicholas of Pisa in the reformation of sculpture. The walls of the Campo Santo are painted by the best masters of their times. Giotto has drawn six historical pieces of Job; and Andrea Orgagna has given a fine piece of the last judgement. Under the portico there is a decree of the city, ordering the inhabitants to wear mourning a year for the death of Cesar.\nNear the church you see a steeple in the form of a cylinder, to which you ascend by 153 steps; it inclines 15 feet on one side, which some attribute to art, but others to the sinking of the foundation. Its inclination is so great that a plumb-line let fall from the top touches the ground at the distance of almost 15 feet from the bottom. It was built by John of Infruck and Bonanno of Pisa, in 1174. Near this steeple is a fine hospital, dependent on that of St Maria Nuova in Florence.\n\nThe steeple of the church of the Augustinians is also very fine, being an octagon, adorned with pillars, and built by Nicholas of Pisa. In the great market-place there is a statue of Plenty, by Pierino da Vinci. In the church of St Matthew, the painting of the ceiling by the brothers Mclani, natives of this city, is an admired performance. The church of the knights of St Stephen, decorated with the trophies taken from the Saracens, is all of marble, with marble steps, and a front adorned with marble statues. In the square there is a statue of Cosimo I. upon a very fine pedestal. Contiguous to the church is the convent or palace of the knights, which is worth seeing, as also the churches Della Madonna and Della Spina; the last of which was built by a beggar, whose figure you may see on the outside of the wall. It is pretended that one of the thorns of the crown which was placed on our Saviour's head is preserved here. Belonging to the university there is a great number of colleges, the chief of which is the Sapienza, where the professors read their public lectures; next to which are the colleges Puteano, Ferdinando, Ricci, and others. Besides the public palace, and that of the grand duke, there are several others with marble fronts, the finest of which is that of Lanfranchi, which, with the rest along the banks of the Arno, makes a very fine appearance. There is here a good dock, where they build the galleys, which are conveyed by the Arno to Leghorn. They have a famous aqueduct in this town, consisting of 9000 arches, which conveys the water from the hills at five miles distance. This water is esteemed the best in Italy, and is carried in flasks to Florence and Leghorn. The neighbouring country produces great store of corn and wine, but the latter is not much esteemed. They have very good butter in this neighbourhood, which is a scarce commodity in Italy. The city for its defence has a moat, walls, a castle, fort, and citadel; the last of which is a modern work. The Arno is of a considerable breadth here, and has three bridges over it, one of them of marble: two leagues below the town it falls into the sea. The physic garden is very spacious, contains a great number of plants, and is decorated with water-works: over the door leading into it are these words,\n\nHic Argus sed non Briareus est: i.e. \"Employ the eyes of Argus, but not the hands of Briareus.\" The air is said to be unwholesome here in summer, on account of the neighbouring marshes. Many buffaloes are bred in the neighbouring country, and their flesh is commonly eaten. Between Pisa and Lucca are hot baths. E. Long. 1\u00b0 17'. N.

After he had rendered himself the favourite of the populace by his liberality and by the intrepidity with which he had fought their battles, particularly near Salamis, he resolved to make himself master of his country. Everything seemed favourable to his ambitious views; but Solon alone, who was then at the head of affairs, and who had lately enforced his celebrated laws, opposed him, and discovered his duplicity and artful behaviour before the public assembly. Pisistratus was not disheartened by the measures of his relation Solon, but he had recourse to artifice. In returning from his country-house, he cut himself in various places; and after he had exposed his mangled body to the eyes of the populace, deplored his misfortunes, and accused his enemies of attempts upon his life, because he was the friend of the people, the guardian of the poor, and the reliever of the oppressed, he claimed a chosen body of 50 men from the populace to defend his person in future from the malevolence and the cruelty of his enemies. The unsuspicious people unanimously granted his request, though Solon opposed it with all his influence; and Pisistratus had no sooner received an armed band on whose fidelity and attachment he could rely, than he seized the citadel of Athens, and made himself absolute. The people too late perceived their credulity; yet, though the tyrant was popular, two of the citizens, Megacles and Lycurgus, conspired together against him, and by their means he was forcibly ejected from the city. His house and all his effects were exposed to sale; but there was found in Athens only one man who would buy them. The private dissensions of the friends of liberty proved favourable to the expelled tyrant; and Megacles, who was jealous of Lycurgus, secretly promised to restore Pisistratus to all his rights and privileges in Athens, if he would marry his daughter. Pisistratus consented; and by the affiance of his father-in-law, he was soon enabled to expel Lycurgus, and to re-establish himself. By means of a woman called Phya, whose shape was tall, whose features were noble and commanding, he imposed upon the people, and created himself adherents even among his enemies. Phya was conducted through the streets of the city, and showing herself subservient to the artifice of Pisistratus, she was announced as Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, and the patroness of Athens, who came down from Heaven to re-establish her favourite Pisistratus in a power which was sanctioned by the will of Heaven, and favoured by the affection of the people. In the midst of his triumph, however, Pisistratus found himself unsupported; and some time after, when\nPisistratus, when he repudiated the daughter of Megacles, he found that not only the citizens, but even his very troops, were alienated from him by the influence, the intrigues, and the bribery of his father-in-law. He fled from Athens where he no longer could maintain his power, and retired to Euboea. Eleven years after he was drawn from his obscure retreat, by means of his son Hippias, and he was a third time received by the people of Athens as their master and sovereign. Upon this he sacrificed to his resentment the friends of Megacles, but he did not lose sight of the public good, and while he fought the aggrandizement of his family, he did not neglect the dignity and the honour of the Athenian name. He died about 528 years before the Christian era, after he had enjoyed the sovereign power at Athens for 33 years, and he was succeeded by his son Hipparchus. Pisistratus claims our admiration for his justice, his liberality, and his moderation. If he was dreaded and detested as a tyrant, the Athenians loved and respected his private virtues and his patriotism as a fellow-citizen; and the opprobrium which generally falls on his head may be attributed not to the severity of his administration, but to the republican principles of the Athenians, who hated and exclaimed against the moderation and equity of the mildest sovereign, while they flattered the pride and gratified the guilty desires of the most tyrannical of their fellow subjects. Pisistratus often refused to punish the insolence of his enemies; and when he had one day been virulently accused of murder, rather than inflict immediate punishment upon the man who had criminated him, he went to the areopagus, and there convinced the Athenians that the accusations of his enemies were groundless, and that his life was irreproachable. It is to his labours that we are indebted for the preservation of the poems of Homer; and he was the first, according to Cicero, who introduced them at Athens in the order in which they now stand. He also established a public library at Athens; and the valuable books which he had diligently collected were carried into Persia when Xerxes made himself master of the capital of Attica. Hipparchus and Hippias the sons of Pisistratus, who had received the name of Pisistratides, rendered themselves as illustrious as their father; but the flames of liberty were too powerful to be extinguished. The Pisistratide governed with great moderation, but the name of tyrant or sovereign was unsupportable to the Athenians. Two of the most respectable of the citizens, called Harmodius and Aristogeiton, conspired against them, and Hipparchus was dispatched in a public assembly. This murder was not, however, attended with any advantages; and though the two leaders of the conspiracy, who have been celebrated through every age for their patriotism, were supported by the people, yet Hippias quelled the tumult by his uncommon firmness and prudence, and for a while preserved that peace in Athens which his father had often been unable to command. This was not long to continue. Hippias was at last expelled by the united efforts of the Athenians and of their allies, and he left Attica, when he found himself unable to maintain his power and independence. The rest of the family of Pisistratus followed him in his banishment; and after they had refused to accept the liberal offers of the princes of Thessaly, and the king of Macedonia, who wished them to settle in their respective territories, the Pisistratide retired to Sigeum, which their father had in the summit of his power conquered and bequeathed to his posterity. After the banishment of the Pisistratide, the Athenians became more than commonly jealous of their liberty, and often sacrificed the most powerful of their citizens, apprehensive of the influence which popularity and a well-directed liberality might gain among a fickle and unsettled populace. The Pisistratide were banished from Athens about 18 years after the death of Pisistratus.\n\nPismires, or Ants, are a kind of insects very common in Africa; of which there is so great a variety, and such innumerable swarms, that they destroy not only the fruits of the ground but sometimes even men and beasts in little time as one single night; and would, without all doubt, prove more fatally destructive to the inhabitants, were they not so happily destroyed by a proportionable number of monkeys and other animals, who greedily devour them. The far greater part of the vast continent of Africa is afflicted with these and some other grievous plagues, and particularly with the horrid visitation of locusts, which seldom fail a year of laying waste some of the provinces.\n\nPiso, Lucius Calpurnius, surnamed Frugi on account of his frugality, was descended of the illustrious family of the Pisos, which gave so many great men to the Roman republic. He was tribune of the people in the year 149 before Christ, and afterwards consul. During his tribuneship, he published a law against the crime of concupiscence or extortion, intitled Lex Calpurnia de pecuniae repetundis. He happily ended the war in Sicily. To reward the services of one of his sons, who had distinguished himself in that expedition, he left him by his will a golden crown, weighing 20 pounds. Piso joined to the qualities of a good citizen the talents of a lawyer, an orator, and historian.\n\nPiso, Caius Calpurnius, a Roman consul in the year 67 before Christ, was author of the law which forbade canvassing for public offices, intitled Lex Calpurnia de ambitu. He displayed all the firmness worthy of a consul in one of the most stormy periods of the republic. The Roman people, deceived by the flattery of Marcus Palicanus, a turbulent and factious fellow, were on the eve of loading themselves with the greatest disgrace, by putting the supreme authority into the hands of this man, who deserved punishment rather than honours. The tribunes of the people, by their harangues, inflamed the blind fury of the multitude, already sufficiently mutinous of themselves. In this situation, Piso mounted the rostrum, and being asked if he would declare Palicanus consul, in case the suffrages of the people should concur in the nomination, he instantly replied, that \"he did not think the republic was yet involved in such darkness and despair as to be capable of committing so infamous an action.\" Being afterwards strongly and repeatedly called upon to say, \"what he would do, if the thing should happen?\" his answer was, \"No, I would not name him.\" By this firm and laconic answer he deprived Palicanus of the dignity to which he aspired. Piso, according to Cicero, was not possessed of a quick conception, but he thought maturely, and with judgment, and, by a proper firmness, he appeared to be an abler man than he really was.\nPiso, Cnecius Calpurnius, was consul in the reign of Augustus, and governor of Syria under Tiberius, whose confidant he was. It is said, that by the order of this emperor he caused Germanicus to be poisoned. Being accused of that crime, and seeing himself abandoned by every body, he laid violent hands on himself in the 26th year of our Lord. He was a man of infupportable pride and excessive violence. Some instances of his wicked cruelty have been handed down to us. Having given orders in the heat of his passion to conduct to punishment a folder, as guilty of the death of one of his companions, because he had gone out of the camp with him and returned without him, no prayers or intreaty could prevail with Piso to suspend the execution of this sentence until the affair should be properly investigated. The folder was led without the entrenchments, and had already presented his head to receive the fatal stroke, when his companion whom he was accused of having killed made his appearance again. Whereupon the centurion, whose office it was to see the sentence executed, ordered the executioner to put up his sword into the scabbard. Those two companions, after embracing each other, are conducted to Piso, amidst the acclamations of the whole army, and a prodigious crowd of people. Piso, foaming with rage, ascends his tribune, and pronounces the same sentence of death against the whole three, without excepting the centurion who had brought back the condemned folder, in these terms: \"You I order to be put to death because you have been already condemned; you, because you have been the cause of the condemnation of your comrade; and you, because having got orders to put that folder to death, you have not obeyed your prince.\"\n\nPissasphaltum, or Asphaltum, Earth-pitch; a fluid, opaque, mineral body, of a thick consistence, strong smell, readily inflammable, but leaving a residuum of greyish ashes after burning. It arises out of the cracks of the rocks, in several places in the island of Sumatra, and some other places in the East Indies, where it is much esteemed in paralytic disorders. There is a remarkable mine of it in the island of Bua, (see BUA), of which the following curious description is given us by the Abb\u00e9 Fortis. \"The island is divided into two promontories between the north and west. Cropping over the top of the latter, which is not half a mile broad, and descending in a right line towards the sea, one is conducted to a hole well known to the inhabitants. This hole extends not much above 12 feet, and from its bottom above 25 feet perpendicular, arise the marble strata which sustain the irregular masses that sur-round the top of the mountain.\n\nThis piffalphaltum is of the most perfect quality, black and shining, very pure, odoriferous, and cohesive; and it comes out almost liquid, but hardens in large drops when the sun sets. On breaking many of these drops on the spot, I found that almost every one of them had an inner cavity full of very clear water.\n\n\"The greatest breadth of the tears that I saw was two inches, and the common breadth is half an inch. The chinks and fissures of the marble, from whence this bituminous pitch tranfudes, are not more than the thickness of a thread; and for the most part are so imperceptible, that were it not for the pitch itself, whereby they are blackened, they could not by any means be distinguished by the naked eye. To the narrowness of these passages is, no doubt, in part owing the small quantity of piffalphaltum that tranfpires.\"\n\nAfter some conjectures about the origin of this mine, our author proceeds to inform us that the piffalphaltum of Bua is correspondent to that fossil production which by Haefelquilt, in his Travels, is called mumia minerales, and mumia nativa Persiana by Kempfer, which the Egyptians made use of to embalm their kings (A). It is found in a cave of Mount Caucasus, which is kept shut, and carefully guarded by order of the king of Persia. One of the qualities assigned by M. Linn\u00e6us to the finest bitumen is to smoke when laid on the fire, as ours does, emitting a smell of pitch not disagreeable. He believes it would be very good for wounds, as the oriental mummia is, and like the pitch of Caltro, which is frequently used by the Roman surgeons for fractures, contusions, and in many external applications. See ASPHALTUM, MINERALOGY Index.\n\nPissell\u00e6um Indicum, Barbados Tar; a mineral fluid of the nature of the thicker bitumens, and of all others the most approaching, in appearance, colour, and consistence, to the true piffalphaltum, but differing from it in other respects. It is very frequent in many parts of America, where it is found trickling down the sides of mountains in large quantities, and sometimes floating on the surface of the waters. It has been greatly recommended internally in coughs and other disorders of the breast and lungs.\n\nPistacia, Turpentine-tree, Pistachia nut and Macfick-tree; a genus of plants belonging to the dioecia class. The most remarkable species are, 1. The terebinthus, or pistachia-tree, which grows naturally in Arabia, Persia, and Syria, whence the nuts are annually brought to Europe. In those countries it grows to the height\n\n(A) \"Mumiahi, or native Persian mummy. It proceeds from a hard rock in very small quantity. It is a bituminous juice, that tranfudes from the stony superficies of the hill, resembling in appearance coarse thomakers wax, as well in its colour as in its density and ductility. While adherent to the rock it is left solid, but is formed by the warmth of the hands. It is easily united with oil, but repels water; it is quite void of smell, and very like in substance to the Egyptian mummy. When laid on burning coals, it has the smell of sulphur tempered a little with that of naphtha, not disagreeable. There are two kinds of this mummy; the one is valuable for its scarcity and great activity. The native place of the best mummy is far from the access of men, from habitations, and from springs of water, in the province of Daraab. It is found in a narrow cave, not above two fathoms deep, cut like a well out of the mass, at the foot of the rugged mountain Caucasus.\"\u2014Kempfer. Amoen. Pers.\n\nThis description agrees perfectly with the piffalphaltum or fossil mummy of Bua, differing only in the privation of smell, which it is difficult to imagine is totally wanting in the Persian mummy.\nheight of 25 or 30 feet; the bark of the stem and old branches is of a dark rufous colour, but that of the young branches is of a light brown. These are garnished with winged leaves, composed sometimes of two, at other times of three, pair of lobes, terminated by an odd one: these lobes approach towards an oval shape, and their edges are turned backward; and these, when bruised, emit a smell similar to that of the shell of the nut. Some of these trees produce male and others female flowers, and some have both male and female on the same tree. The male flowers come out from the sides of the branches in loose bunches or catkins. They have no petals, but five small stamens crowned by large four-cornered summits filled with farina; and when this is discharged, the flowers fall off. The female flowers come out in clusters from the sides of the branches: they have no petals, but a large oval germen supporting three reflexed styles, and are succeeded by oval nuts.\n\n2. The lentifcus, or common mastic tree, grows naturally in Portugal, Spain, and Italy. Being an evergreen, it has been preferred in this country in order to adorn the green-houses. In the countries where it is a native, it rises to the height of 18 or 20 feet, covered with a grey bark on the stem; but the branches, which are very numerous, are covered with a reddish brown bark, and are garnished with winged leaves, composed of three or four pair of small spear-shaped lobes, without an odd one at the end.\n\n3. The orientalis, or true mastic tree of the Levant, from which the malachite is gathered, has been confounded by most botanical writers with the lentifcus, or common mastic tree, above described, though there are considerable differences between them. The bark of the tree is brown; the leaves are composed of two or three pair of spear-shaped lobes, terminated by an odd one: the outer lobes are the largest; the others gradually diminish, the innermost being the least. These turn of a brownish colour towards the autumn, when the plants are exposed to the open air; but if they are under glasses, they keep green. The leaves continue all the year, but are not so thick as those of the common sort, nor are the plants so hardy.\n\nCulture. The first species is propagated by its nuts, which should be planted in pots filled with light kitchen-garden earth, and plunged into a moderate hot bed to bring up the plants; when these appear, they should have a large share of air admitted to them, and by degrees they should be exposed to the open air, which at last they will bear in all seasons, though not without great danger of being destroyed in severe winters. The second sort is commonly propagated by laying down the branches, though it may also be raised from the seed in the manner already directed for the pistacia-nut tree; and in this manner also may the true mastic-tree be raised. But this being more tender than any of the other sorts, requires to be constantly sheltered in winter, and to have a warm situation in summer.\n\nPistacia nuts are moderately large, containing a kernel of a pale greenish colour, covered with a reddish skin. They have a pleasant, sweet, unctuous taste, resembling that of almonds; and they abound with a sweet and well-tasted oil, which they yield in great abundance on being pressed after bruising them: they are reckoned amongst the analeptics, and are wholesome and nutritious, and are by some esteemed very proper to be prescribed by way of restoratives, eaten in small quantity, to people emaciated by long illness.","sp":190,"ep":193},{"h":"PISTIL","t":"among botanists, the little upright column which is generally found in the centre of every flower. According to the Linnaean system, it is the female part of generation, whose office is to receive and secrete the pollen, and produce the fruit. It consists of three parts, viz. germen, style, and stigma. See Botany Index.\n\nPISTOIA is a city of Italy, in the duchy of Tuscany, situated on the river Stella, in a beautiful plain near the foot of the Apennine mountains. By Pliny it is called Pyllorium, and is said to have been once a Roman colony. At present it is a bishop's see, suffragan of Florence. The streets are broad and regular, the houses tolerably well built, but poorly inhabited for want of trade. Formerly it was an independent republic, but since it was subdued by the Florentines in 1200, it has been in a declining condition. The cathedral has a very handsome cupola, and a magnificent staircase to ascend to it. In the chapel dedicated to St James, where his relics are preserved, the walls are almost covered with plates of silver. Here are four marble statues of very good workmanship. The marble pulpit, the belfry, relieves, the vessel that holds the holy water, and the square steeple, are the work of John Pifano. The Jesuits have a very fine college, and the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians, good churches. In the church of Madonna dell' Umilt\u00e0 there are two statues, one of Leo X. and the other of Clement VII. The public palace, situated in a large square, is a handsome building; several of the nobility have also very good houses. In the neighbouring mountains, called by the name of Pistoia, there are many large villages, the chief of which is that of S. Marcello, belonging to the family of Cartoli. These mountains are a part of the Apennines, and border on the territory of Bologna and the county of Vernio; higher up is the source of the river Reno. The country about Pistoia, especially towards Florence, is exceeding fertile and delightful, covered with all sorts of fruits, corn, wine, &c. &c. containing a vast number of little towns, wealthy villages, and country seats, so as to be reckoned the richest and most beautiful in all Tuscany.

The sativum, or greater garden-pea, whose lower stipules are roundish, indented, with taper foot-stalks, and many flowers on a foot-stalk.\n\n2.

The ochrus, with membranaceous running foot-stalks, having two leaves and one flower upon a foot-stalk.\n\nThere is a great variety of garden-peas now cultivated in Britain, which are distinguished by gardeners and seedmen, and have their different titles; but as great part of these have been seminal variations, so if they are not very carefully managed, by taking away all those plants which have a tendency to alter before the seeds are formed, they will degenerate into their original state: therefore all those persons who are curious in the choice of their seeds, look carefully over those which they design for seeds at the time when they begin to flower, and draw out all the plants which they dislike from the other. This is what they call roguing their peas; meaning hereby the taking out all the bad plants from the good, that the farina of the former may not impregnate the latter; to prevent which, they always do it before the flowers open. By thus diligently drawing out the bad, referring those which come earliest to flower, they have greatly improved their peas of late years, and are constantly endeavouring to get forwarder varieties; so that it would be to little purpose in this place to attempt giving a particular account of all the varieties now cultivated: we shall therefore only mention the names by which they are commonly known, placing them according to their time of coming to the table, or gathering for use.\n\nThe golden hotspur.

This was brought from Cape Horn by Lord Anson's cook, when he passed that cape, where these peas were a great relief to the sailors. It is kept here as a curiosity, but the peas are not so good for eating as the worst sort now cultivated in Britain. It is a low trailing plant; the leaves have two lobes on each foot-stalk: those below are spear-shaped, and sharply indented on their edges; but the upper leaves are small, and arrow-pointed. The flowers are blue, each foot-stalk sustaining four or five flowers; the pods are taper, near three inches long; and the seeds are round, about the size of tares.\n\nThe sixth sort is annual. This grows naturally among the corn in Sicily and some parts of Italy, but is here preserved in botanic gardens for the sake of variety. It hath an angular stalk, rising near three feet high; the leaves stand upon winged foot-stalks, each sustaining two oblong lobes. The flowers are of a pale yellow colour, shaped like those of the other sort of pea, but are small, each foot-stalk sustaining one flower; these are succeeded by pods about two inches long, containing five or six roundish seeds, which are a little compressed on their sides. These are by some persons eaten green; but unless they are gathered very young, they are coarse, and at best not so good as the common pea. It may be sown and managed in the same way as the garden pea.\n\nFor an account of the method of cultivating the several sorts of garden peas, so as to continue them throughout the season, see Gardening.\n\nThe gray and other large winter peas are seldom cultivated in gardens, because they require a great deal of room; they are therefore usually sown in fields. For the proper method of managing them, see Agriculture.\n\nIn the Museum Rusticum, vol. i. p. 109, we find the following method of preparing peas for hog-meal, which we shall give in the words of the ingenious farmer who communicated it.\n\n\"A few years ago (says he), I had a plentiful crop of peas on a ten acre piece, which lies near my house: when they were full podded and nearly ripe, I had them hooked in the usual manner; but before I could get them in, there came a heavy shower of rain which wetted them through and through; and the dull heavy weather, with frequent showers which followed, prevented their drying for a considerable time.\n\n\"I caused the wads to be from time to time turned, to prevent the haulm from rotting; and at length a few days sunshine dried them enough to be mowed; for as they lay hollow, the wind was greatly assistant to the operation.\n\n\"Before I got them in, on examining some of the pods, I found that the peas were all sprouted to a considerable length; this was what I had expected, as I gave my crop over for loft, till after a little recollection, as the weather still continued fine, I determined to thresh them in the field.\n\n\"This was accordingly done; and the corn, after it was salt and riddled to separate it from the rubbish, was dried on my malt kiln.\n\n\"When this operation was over, I began to reflect in what manner I should dispose of my peas, being sensible that they could not be proper for feed, and standing no chance of disposing of them to any advantage in the market.\n\n\"At length, as it was then a time of war, and of course there was a great demand for pork for the use of the navy, I determined to buy a considerable number of lean hogs, that I might by their means consume this crop on my own premises, and in that manner make the most of it.\n\n\"My expectations were more than answered; for I found, by repeated experience, that three bushels of the peas I have mentioned went nearly as far in fattening the hogs I bought as four bushels got in dry and hard in the manner usually practised.\n\n\"This discovery I made several years ago, and it has turned out to my advantage; for since that time I have been quite indifferent as to the weather in which my peas are hooked, being rather better pleased, as far as relates to them, with wet than dry weather;\"\nPIT\n\nther; but if the weather happens to be dry at the time they are ripe, I always cause as many as I want for feeding my hogs, which are not a few in a year, to be regularly malted in the same manner nearly as my barley: this management has of late succeeded very well with me, and I therefore intend to continue it.\n\n\"Besides feeding my hogs with these malted pease, I have often given them to my horses, with which they agree very well, and are heartening food.\n\n\"Turkeys will fatten apace on them also, and be fine meat.\n\n\"I have applied my malted pease to many other uses, which I have not at present time to enumerate: but were they only used for feeding hogs and horses, it is still worth while to prepare some in this manner every year.\"","sp":193,"ep":195},{"h":"PITCAIRNE","t":"Dr Archibald, an eminent physician and ingenious poet, was descended from the ancient family of the Pitcairnes of Pitcairne in Fifehire, and was born at Edinburgh on the 25th of December 1652. He commenced his studies at the school of Dalkeith; and from thence he was removed to the university of Edinburgh, where he improved himself in classical learning, and completed a regular course of philosophy. His friends, according to the authors of the Biographia Britannica, were delirious that he should follow the profession of theology. The unpleasant gloom, however, which at that time hung over religion and its professors Pitcairne in Scotland, could not but very ill suit with that native cheerfulness of temper and liberality of mind which made him, long after, a mark for the arrows of prejudice and grimace. The law seems to have been his own choice, and to this science he turned his attention. With an ardour peculiar to himself, and an ambition to excel in whatever he undertook, he pursued it with so much intensity, that his health began to be impaired. On this account, his physicians advised him to let out for the south of France. By the time he reached Paris, he was happily so far recovered, that he determined to renew his studies; but being informed that there was no able professor of law in that city, and finding several gentlemen of his acquaintance engaged in the study of physic, he went with them to the lectures and hospitals, and employed himself in this manner for several months till his affairs called him home.\n\nOn his return, he applied himself chiefly to the mathematics. It is not usual to see the briars of this science and the flowers of poetry growing in the same foil. Here, however, they were happily united; and to this union perhaps was owing that singular command of judgement, over one of the liveliest of fancies, which appears in every part of his works. His intimacy with Dr David Gregory, the celebrated mathematical professor, began about the same time; and probably conduced to cherish his natural aptitude for this study. It was then in a great measure, new to him; it soon became his principal delight; his progress in it was rapid, and correspondent to his progress in other pursuits. His improvements on the method of infinite series then adopted, which Dr Wallis of Oxford afterwards published, were a conspicuous and early proof of his abilities in this science.\n\nHad Dr Pitcairne continued to prosecute the study of the law, and could he have moulded his principles to the times, the first offices and honours of the state might have been looked for without presumption as the probable reward of such talents as he possessed. Struck, however with the charms of mathematical truth which had been lately introduced into the philosophy of medicine, and hoping to reduce the healing art to geometrical method, he unalterably determined on this less aspiring profession. At the period when he formed this resolution, the ideas of the medical world, already sufficiently confused, were still farther jumbled by the discovery of the circulation of the blood, which had as yet produced nothing but doubt, uncertainty, and astonishment. In Edinburgh at that time there was no school, no hospital, no opportunity of improvement but the chamber and the shop. He therefore soon after returned to Paris. Genius and industry are unhappily not often united in the same character: of such an union, however, Dr Pitcairne is a celebrated instance. During his residence in France, he cultivated the object of his pursuit with his natural enthusiasm, and with a steadfastness from which he could not be diverted by the allurements of that joy which, in his hours of social and festive intercourse, he always felt and always gave. Among his various occupations, the study of the ancient physicians seems to have had a principal share. This appears from a treatise which he published some time after his return; and it shows, that he wisely determined\nto know the progress of medicine from its earliest periods, before he attempted to reform and improve that science.\n\nOn the 13th of August 1689, he received, from the faculty of Rheims the degree of Doctor; which, on the 7th of August 1699, was likewise conferred on him by the university of Aberdeen; both being attended with marks of peculiar distinction. Other medical honours are said to have been conferred on him in France and elsewhere; but nothing affords a more unequivocal testimony to his abilities than that which the surgeons of Edinburgh gave, in admitting him, freely and unostentatiously, a member of their college. None had such opportunities of judging of his merit as a practitioner, and on no physician did they ever bestow the same public mark of respect. Soon after his graduation at Rheims, he returned to Edinburgh; where, on the 29th of November 1681, the Royal College of Physicians was instituted; and his name, among others, graced the original patent from the crown.\n\nIn his Soluto Problematis de Inventoribus, the treatise above alluded to, he discovers a wonderful degree of medical literature, and makes use of it in a manner that does great honour both to his head and his heart. His object is to vindicate Dr Harvey's claim to the discovery of the circulation of the blood. The discovery was, at first, controverted by envy, and reproached by ignorance. When at length its truth was fully established, many invidiously attempted to tear the laurels from the illustrious Englishman, and to plant them on the brows of Hippocrates and others. Had the attempt been directed against himself, the generous soul of Pitcairne could not have exerted more zeal in a defence; and his arguments remain unanswered.\n\nDuring his residence in Scotland, his reputation became so considerable, that, in the year 1691, the university of Leyden solicited him to fill the medical chair, at that time vacant. Such an honourable testimony of respect, from a foreign nation, and from such an university, cannot perhaps be produced in the medical biography of Great Britain. The lustre of such characters reflects honour on their profession, and on the country which has the good fortune of giving them birth; and serves to give the individuals of that country not only a useful estimation in their own eyes, but in those also of the rest of the world. Dr Pitcairne's well-known political principles excluded him from public honours and promotion at home; he therefore accepted the invitation from abroad; and, on the 26th of April 1692, delivered, at Leyden, his elegant and masterly inaugural oration: Oratio qua ostenditur medicinam ab omni philo-\n\n(A) Dr Boerhaave gives the following character of these and some other of Dr Pitcairne's dissertations, which were collected and published at Rotterdam, anno 1701: \"Hec scripta optima sunt et perfecta, five legas Dissertacionem de Motu Sanguinis per Pulmones, five alia opuscula, five ultimum tractatum de Opio.\" Methodus studii, ab Hallero edita, p. 509.\n\n(B) He had been married before to a daughter of Colonel James Hay of Pitfour, by whom he had a son and daughter, who both died young.\n\n(C) Vide Pitcairnii Poemata.\u2014Several of his poems, however, are obscure, and some of them totally unintelligible without a key. In those of them which are of a political kind, he wished not to express himself too clearly; and in others, he alludes to private occurrences which were not known beyond the circle of his companions. His poem (Ad Lindeium), addressed to his friend Lindley, is commented on by the authors of the Biographia Britannica; and it is to be regretted that it is the only one on which they have been solicitous to throw light.\nexerted in the cure of disease, still operate to the good of posterity.\n\nThe discovery of the circulation, while in some measure it exploded the chemical and Galenical doctrines, tended to introduce mathematical and mechanical reasoning in their stead. Of this theory (n) Dr Pitcairne was the principal support, and the first who introduced it into Britain. A mathematical turn of mind, and a wish for mathematical certainty in medicine, biased him in its favour, and he pushed it to its utmost extent. One is at a loss whether most to admire or regret such a waste of talents in propounding a theory which, though subversive of former ones, was to fall before others but a little more satisfactory than itself. Mechanical physicians expected more from geometry than that science could grant. They made it the foundation instead of an auxiliary to their inquiries, and applied it to parts of nature not admitting mathematical calculations. By paying more attention afterwards to the supreme influence of the living principle, the source of all the motions and functions of the body, it was found that these could not be explained by any laws of chemistry or mechanism. They are still, however, involved in obscurity; and notwithstanding the numberless improvements which have taken place in the sciences connected with medicine, will perhaps remain incurable while man continues in his present stage of existence.\n\nIn a science so slowly progressive as that of medical practice, Dr Pitcairne did a great deal. By labouring in vain for truth in one road, he saved many the same drudgery, and thereby showed the necessity of another. He not only exploded many false notions of the chemists and Galenists which prevailed in his time, but many of those too of his own feet. In particular, he showed the absurdity of referring all diseases and their cures to an alkali or an acid (r). He refuted the idea of secretion being performed by pores differently shaped (v), Bellini's opinion of effervescences in the animal spirits with the blood, and Bonelli's of air entering the blood by respiration (g). He proved the continuity of the arteries and veins (h); and seems to have been the first who showed that the blood flows from a smaller capacity into a larger; that the aorta, with respect to the arterial system, is the apex of a cone (i). In this therefore he may be considered as the latent spring of the discoveries respecting the powers moving the blood. He introduced a simplicity of prescription unknown in pharmacy before his time (k); and such was the state of medicine in this country, that scarcely have the works of any contemporary or preceding author been thought worthy even of preservation (l). As to the errors of his philosophy, let it be remembered, that no theory has as yet stood the test of many years in an enlightened period. His own hung very loosely.\n\nlight. \"Some parts (fay they) of this poem, are hardly intelligible, without knowing a circumstance in the doctor's life, which he often told, and never without some emotion. It is a well known story of the two Platonic philosophers, who promised one another, that whichever died first should make a visit to his surviving companion. This story being read by Mr Lindley and our author together, they being both then very young, entered into the same engagement. Soon after, Pitcairne, at his father's house in Fife, dreamed one morning that Lindley, who was then at Paris, came to him, and told him he was not dead, as was commonly reported, but still alive, and lived in a very agreeable place, to which he could not yet carry him. By the course of the poet news came of Lindley's death, which happened very suddenly the morning of the dream. When this is known, the poem is easily understood, and shines with no common degree of beauty.\n\n\"Lyndell!

No one appeared ever to have had so much practice in this country, or so many consultations from abroad; and no one, from all accounts, ever practised with greater sagacity and success. The highest thought themselves honoured by his acquaintance, and the lowest were never denied his assistance and advice. The emoluments of his profession must have been great; but his charities are known to have been correspondent. The possession of money he postponed to more liberal objects; he collected one of the finest private libraries in the world; which was purchased, after his death, by the Czar of Muscovy. Notwithstanding the fatigues he underwent in the exercise of his profession, his constitution was naturally delicate. About the beginning of October 1713, he became affected with his last illness; and on the 23rd he died, regretted by science as its ornament, by his country as its boast, and by humanity as its friend. He left a son and four daughters: of whom only one of the latter now survives.

At the end of each blast, when the wind fulfils its action, this repulsion lifts the vessel; and these succussive inclinations and repulsions produce the movement of pitching, which is very inconvenient; and, when it is considerable, will greatly retard the course, as well as endanger the mast, and strain the vessel.","sp":198,"ep":198},{"h":"PITCOAL","t":"or STONE-COAL.

He learned the mathematics without a master, and went to Paris in 1718, where he formed a close friendship with the illustrious Reaumur. In 1724, he was admitted a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, and in a few years rose to the degree of a pensioner. Besides a vast number of Memoirs printed in the collection of that society, he published in 1731 the Theory of the Working of Ships, in one volume 4to; a work of considerable merit, which was translated into English, and made the author be admitted into the Royal Society of London. In 1740, the states-general of Languedoc made choice of him for their chief engineer, and gave him at the same time the appointment of inspector general of the canal which unites the two seas. That province is indebted to him for several monuments of his genius, which will transmit his name with lustre to posterity. The city of Montpellier being in want of water, Pitot brought from the distance of three leagues the water of two springs which furnish a plentiful supply of that necessary article. They are brought to the magnificent Place du Peyron, and thence are distributed through the city. This astonishing work is the admiration of all strangers.

Having continued in that university not quite two years, he left the kingdom as a voluntary Roman exile, and retired to Douay; thence he went to the English college at Rheims, where he remained about a year; and then proceeded to Rome, where he continued a member of the English college near seven years, and was made a priest. In 1589 he returned to Rheims; and there, during two years, taught rhetoric and the Greek language. He now quitted Rheims on account of the civil war in France; and retired to Pont \u00e0 Mousson in Lorraine, where he took the degrees of master of arts and bachelor in divinity. Hence he travelled into Germany, and resided a year and a half at Trier, where he commenced licentiate in his faculty. From Trier he visited several of the principal cities in Germany; and continuing three years at Ingolstadt in Bavaria, took the degree of doctor in divinity. Thence having made the tour of Italy, he returned once more to Lorraine; where he was patronized by the cardinal of that duchy, who preferred him to a canonry of Verdun; and about two years after he became confessor to the duchess of Cleves, daughter to the duke of Lorraine. During the leisure he enjoyed in this employment, he wrote in Latin the lives of the kings, bishops, apostolic men, and writers of England. The last of these, commonly known and quoted by this title, De illybris Angliae scriptoribus, was published after his death.

He was the youngest son of Robert Pitt, Esq., of Bocconock in Cornwall; and grandson of Thomas Pitt, Esq.; governor of Fort St George in the East Indies, in the reign of Queen Anne, who told an extraordinary diamond to the king of France for \u00a33,000.1. and thus obtained the name of Diamond Pitt. His intellectual faculties and powers of elocution very soon made a distinguished appearance; but at the age of 16 he felt the attacks of an hereditary and incurable gout, by which he was tormented at times during the rest of his life.\n\nHis lordship entered early into the army, and served in a regiment of dragoons. Through the interest of the duchess of Marlborough he obtained a seat in parliament before he was 21 years of age. His first appearance in the house was as representative of the borough of Old Sarum, in the ninth parliament of Great Britain. In the tenth he represented Seaforth, Aldborough in the eleventh, and the city of Bath in the twelfth; where he continued till he was called up to the house of peers in 1766. The intention of the duchess in bringing him thus early into parliament was to oppose Sir Robert Walpole, whom he kept in awe by the force of his eloquence. At her death the duchess left him \u00a310,000.1. on condition, as was then reported, that he never should receive a place in administration. However, if any such condition was made, it certainly was not kept on his lordship's part. In 1746 he was appointed vice-treasurer of Ireland, and soon after paymaster general of the forces, and sworn a privy councillor. He discharged the office of paymaster with such honour and inflexible integrity, refusing even many of the perquisites of his office, that his bitterest enemies could lay nothing to his charge, and he soon became the darling of the people. In 1755 he resigned the office of paymaster, on seeing Mr Fox preferred to him. The people were alarmed at this resignation; and being disgusted with the unsuccessful beginning of the war, complained so loudly, that, on the 4th December 1756, Mr Pitt was appointed secretary of state in the room of Mr Fox afterwards Lord Holland; and other promotions were made in order to second his plans. He then took such measures as were necessary for the honour and interest of the nation; but in the month of February 1757, having refused to assent to the carrying on a war in Germany, for the sake of his majesty's dominions on the continent, he was deprived of the seals on the 5th of April following. Upon this the complaints of the people again became so violent, that on the 29th of June he was again appointed secretary, and his friends filled other important offices. The success with which the war was now conducted is universally known; yet on the 5th of October 1761, Mr Pitt, to the astonishment of almost the whole kingdom, resigned the seals into his majesty's own hands. The reason of this was, that Mr\nPitt, having received certain intelligence that the family-compact was signed between France and Spain, and that the latter was about to join France against us, thought it necessary to prevent her by commencing hostilities first. Having communicated this opinion in the privy-council, the other ministers urged that they would think twice before they declared war against that kingdom. \"I will not give them leave to think\" (replied Mr Pitt); this is the time, let us crush the whole house of Bourbon. But if the members of this board are of a different opinion, this is the last time I shall ever mix in its councils. I was called into the ministry by the voice of the people, and to them I hold myself answerable for my conduct. I am to thank the ministers of the late king for their support; I have served my country with success; but I will not be responsible for the conduct of the war any longer than while I have the direction of it.\" To this bold declaration, the lord who then presided in council made the following reply. \"I find the gentleman determined to leave us; nor can I say that I am sorry for it, since he would otherwise have certainly compelled us to leave him. But if he is resolved to assume the right of advising his majesty, and directing the operations of the war, to what purpose are we called to this council? When he talks of being responsible to the people, he talks the language of the house of commons, and forgets that at this board he is responsible only to the king. However, though he may possibly have convinced himself of his infallibility, still it remains that we should be equally convinced before we can resign our understandings to his direction, or join with him in the measure he proposes.\"\n\nThis conversation, which was followed by Mr Pitt's resignation, is sufficient to show the haughtiness and imperious temper of our minister. However, these very qualities were sometimes productive of great and good consequences, as appears from the following anecdote.\n\n\u2014Preparatory to one of the secret expeditions during the war which ended in 1763 the minister had given orders to the different presiding officers in the military, navy, and ordnance departments, to prepare a large body of forces, a certain number of ships, and a proportionable quantity of stores, &c., and to have them all ready against a certain day. To these orders he received an answer from each of the officers, declaring the total impossibility of a compliance with them. Notwithstanding it was then at a very late hour, he sent immediately for his secretary; and after expressing his resentment at the ignorance or negligence of his majesty's servants, he gave the following commands:\n\n\"I desire, Mr Wood, that you will immediately go to Lord Anson; you need not trouble yourself to search the admiralty, he is not to be found there; you must pursue him to the gaming-house, and tell him from me, that if he does not obey the orders of government which he has received at my hands, that I will most assuredly impeach him. Proceed from him to Lord Ligonier; and though he should be bolstered with harlots, undraw his curtains, and repeat the same message. Then direct your course to Sir Charles Frederick, and assure him that if his majesty's orders are not obeyed, they shall be the last which he shall receive from me.\" In consequence of these commands, Mr Wood proceeded to White's, and told his errand to the first lord of the admiralty; who insisted that the secretary of state was out of his senses, and it was impossible to comply with his wishes: \"However,\" (added he), \"as madmen must be answered, tell him that I will do my utmost to satisfy him.\" From thence he went to the commander in chief of the forces, and delivered the same message. He also said that it was an impossible business; \"and the secretary knows it,\" (added the old lord): nevertheless, he is in the right to make us do what we can; and what it is possible to do, inform him, shall be done.\" The surveyor general of the ordnance was next informed of Mr Pitt's resolution; and, after some little consideration, he began to think that the orders might be completed within the time prescribed. The consequence at last was, that everything, in spite of impossibilities themselves, was ready at the time appointed.\n\nAfter his resignation in 1761, Mr Pitt never had any share in administration. He received a pension of \u00a33000 a-year, to be continued after his decease, during the survivancy of his lady and son; and this gratuity was dignified with the title of Baronets of Chatham to his lady, and that of Baron to her heirs male. Mr Pitt at that time declined the title of nobility; but in 1765 accepted of a peerage under the title of Baron Pynsent and Earl of Chatham, and at the same time he was appointed lord privy seal.\n\nThis acceptance of a peerage proved very prejudicial to his lordship's character. However, he continued steadfast in his opposition to the measures of administration. His last appearance in the house of lords was on the 2d of April 1778. He was then very ill and much debilitated: but the question was important, being a motion of the duke of Richmond to address his majesty to remove the ministers, and make peace with America on any terms. His lordship made a long speech, which had certainly overcome his spirits: for, attempting to rise a second time, he fell down in a convulsive fit; and though he recovered for that time, his disorder continued to increase till the 11th of May, when he died at his seat at Hayes. His death was lamented as a national loss. As soon as the news reached the house of commons, which was then sitting, Colonel Barre made a motion, that an address should be presented to his majesty, requesting that the earl of Chatham should be buried at the public expense. But Mr Rigby having proposed the erecting of a statue to his memory, as more likely to perpetuate the sense of his great merits entertained by the public, this was unanimously carried. A bill was soon after passed, by which \u00a34000 a-year was settled upon John now earl of Chatham, and the heirs of the late earl to whom that title may descend.\u2014His lordship was married in 1754 to Lady Hester, sister to the earl of Temple; by whom he had three sons and two daughters.\n\nNever perhaps was any life so multifarious as that of Lord Chatham; never did any comprise such a number of interesting situations. To bring the scattered features of such a character into one point of view, is an arduous task. The author of the history of his life has attempted to do it; and with the outlines of what he has said in summing up his character, we shall finish our biographical sketch of this wonderful man.\n\n\"One of the first things that strikes us, in the recollection of Chatham's life, is the superior figure he makes among his contemporaries. Men of genius and attraction, a Carteret, a Townshend, and I had almost\nPIT\n\nsaid a Mansfield, however pleasing in a limited view, appear evidently in this comparison to think into narrower dimensions, and walk a humbler circle. All that deserves to arrest the attention, in taking a general survey of the age in which he lived, is comprised in the history of Chatham. No character ever bore the more undoubted stamp of originality. Unresembled and himself, he was not born to accommodate to the genius of his age. While all round him were deprived by the uniformity of fashion, or the contagion of venality, he stood aloof. He consulted no judgement but his own; and he acted from the untainted dictates of a comprehensive soul.\n\n\"The native royalty of his mind is eminently conspicuous. He felt himself born to command; and the free sons of Britain implicitly obeyed him. In him was realized the fable of Orpheus; and his genius, his spirit, his eloquence, led millions in his train, subdued the rugged savage, and disarmed the fangs of malignity and envy. Nothing is in its nature so inconsistent as the breath of popular applause: and yet that breath was eminently his during the greater part of his life. Want of success could not divert it; inconsistency of conduct could not change its tenor. The astonishing extent of his views, and the mysterious comprehension of his plans, did not in one respect set him above little things: nothing that was necessary to the execution of his designs was beneath him. In another respect, however, he was infinitely estranged to little things: swallowed up in the business of his country, he did not think of the derangement of his own private affairs; for, though indisposed to all the modes of dissipated expense, his affairs, even when his circumstances were much improved, were always deranged. But the features that seem most eminently to have characterized him, were spirit and intrepidity: they are conspicuous in every action and in every turn of his life; nor did this spirit and intrepidity leave him even at the last.\n\n\"The manners of Lord Chatham were easy and bland, his conversation was spirited and gay, and he readily adapted himself to the complexion of those with whom he associated. That artificial reserve, which is the never-failing refuge of self-diffidence and cowardice, was not made for him. He was unconstrained as artless infancy, and generous as the noon-day fun: yet had he something impenetrable that hung about him. By an irresistible energy of soul, he was haughty and imperious. He was incapable of associating councils, and he was not formed for the sweetest bands of society. He was a pleasing companion, but an unpliant friend.\n\n\"The ambition of our hero, however generous in its strain, was the source of repeated errors in his conduct. To the resignation of Lord Carteret, and again, from the commencement of the year 1772, his proceedings were bold and uniform. In the intermediate period they were marked with a versatility, incident only in general to the most flexible minds. We may occasionally trace in them the indecision of a candidate, and the supplenets of a courtier. In a word, he aimed at the impossible task of flattering at once the prejudices of a monarch, and pursuing unremittingly the interests of the people.\n\n\"A feature, too, sufficiently prominent in his character, was vanity, or perhaps pride and conscious superiority. He dealt surely somewhat too freely with invective. He did not pretend to an ignorance of his talents, or to manage the display of his important virtues. Himself was too often the hero of his tale; and the successefs of the last war the burden of his song.\n\n\"Patriotism was also the source of some of his imperfections. He loved his country too well; or, if that may sound absurd, the benevolence at least, that embraces the species, had not sufficient scope in his mind. He once styled himself a lover of honourable war; and in so doing he let us into one trait of his character. The friend of human kind will be an enemy to all war. He indulged too much a puerile antipathy to the house of Bourbon; and it was surely the want of expansive affections that led him to so unqualified a condemnation of American independency.\n\n\"But the eloquence of Lord Chatham was one of his most striking characteristics. He far outstripped his competitors, and stood alone the rival of antiquity.\n\n\"His eloquence was of every kind. No man excelled him in close argument and methodical deduction: but this was not the style into which he naturally fell. His oratory was unlaboured and spontaneous: he rushed at once upon the subject; and usually illustrated it rather by glowing language and original conception, than by cool reasoning. His person was tall and dignified; his face was the face of an eagle; his piercing eye withered the nerves, and looked through the souls of his opponents; his countenance was stern, and the voice of thunder sat upon his lips: anon, however, he could descend to the easy and the playful. His voice seemed scarcely more adapted to energy and to terror, than it did to the melodious, the infusing, and the sportive. If, however, in the enthusiasm of admiration, we can find room for the frigidity of criticism, his action seemed the most open to objection. It was forcible, uniform, and ungraceful. In a word, the most celebrated orators of antiquity were in a great measure the children of labour and cultivation. Lord Chatham was always natural and himself.\"\n\nTo the misfortune of letters, and of posterity, it has been said, his lordship never published anything. Lord Chesterfield says, \"that he had a most happy turn for poetry: but it is more than probable that Chesterfield was deceived; for we are told by his biographer that his verses to Garrick were very meagre, and Lord Chatham himself said that he seldom indulged and seldom avowed it. It should seem, then, that he himself felt no great value upon it. Perhaps a proper confidence of one's self is essential to all extraordinary merit. Why should we ambitiously ascribe to one mind every species of human excellence? But though he was no poet, it is more than probable, that he would have excelled as much in writing prose as he did in speaking it.","sp":200,"ep":202},{"h":"PITT","t":"the Right Honourable William, was the fourth child of that illustrious orator and consummate statesman, William Pitt, the first earl of Chatham, and was born on the 28th of May 1759.

Thomas Pitt, the first of the name who attained any considerable eminence, was governor of Fort St George in the East Indies, where he purchased, as noticed in the preceding life, for 20,400l. sterling, the extraordinary diamond called the regent, weighing 127 carats, and which was sold to the king of France for the enormous sum of 135,000l. sterling. This diamond it is said, now occupies a conspicuous place in the imperial diadem of Bonaparte.\nBonaparte. By means of this vast sum he was enabled to purchase a considerable estate in Cornwall; yet his grand-children were poorly provided for, particularly the great earl of Chatham, but what he wanted in opulence was abundantly supplied by the uncommon talents and abilities, which nature conferred upon him in the profusest manner. Although he betook himself for support to the profession of arms, he never rose higher than to the rank of a cornet of horse, of which Sir Robert Walpole, with unexampled meanness, deprived him, because he had the boldness and integrity to oppose his administration. This, however, proved no real obstacle to his preferment in the state, for in the year 1756 he became prime minister.\n\nAs the present earl of Chatham was destined for the army, and another son James Charles for the navy, lord Chatham resolved to train up William to the profession of a statesman. Having therefore confided the care of his other two sons to others, he took William under his own immediate inspection, whose rapid progress cheered the solitude, and illumined the declining days of this extraordinary man, who already began to prefigure his future greatness. His school exercises were performed under the care of a private tutor, a Mr. afterwards Dr Wilson, while his noble father embraced every opportunity of conversing with him on every interesting topic with the utmost freedom, in order to expand his mind, and mature his judgement. He also made him declaim from a chair or a table, well knowing that the gift of eloquence is a valuable acquisition for a young man who wishes to arrive at eminence, and that it had supplied the deficiencies of fortune in his own person.\n\nIt was resolved on, at a proper period, to send William to one of the universities, and on this occasion Cambridge was preferred to Oxford, from a decided opinion entertained by many, that the political doctrines inculcated at the former were more liberal than those usually propagated at the latter. He was accordingly placed under the tuition of Dr Turner of Pembroke Hall. Dr Prettyman, afterwards bishop of Lincoln, also participated in the care of his education, and was his private instructor. During his residence at Cambridge, it appears certain that the morals and conduct of Mr Pitt were unimpeachable, not in the smallest degree contaminated by the powerful example of the young nobility. Here he took his bachelor's degree, and also that of A.M. and acquired such reputation in the university for talents, industry, and propriety of deportment, as proved of great advantage to him in his subsequent pursuits through life.\n\nWhen Mr Pitt left the university, he was entered at Lincoln's Inn, much about the same time with Mr Addington, whose father had been both the physician and friend of his family, and was enabled to be called to the bar in the space of three years, having received some marks of favour on account of his degree. He made choice of the western circuit as the scene of his first efforts; but having little practice as an lawyer, he had of consequence but little celebrity; and it is probable that he was ill qualified, on the score of patient and laborious investigation, for a pursuit in which nothing great can be accomplished, without the persevering industry of a whole life.\n\nFortune at this time seemed eager to heap favours upon him of another kind. Being bred a statesman, the house of commons was of course the place where he was to begin his political career. He was advised by numerous friends to propose himself a candidate for the university of Cambridge, but he failed of success from the want of sufficient influence. Accident, however, brought about what the designs of his friends could not accomplish. The duke of Rutland asked Sir James Lowther (afterwards earl of Lonsdale), if he could possibly make room in any of his boroughs, to bring in his young friend Mr Pitt, who had thus lost his election for Cambridge. He was chosen member for the borough of Appleby. About this time the American war was raging with unabated violence, which Mr Pitt, following the example and advice of his father, reproached as one of the most shameful and ruinous conflicts of modern times. Having espoused the constitutional and popular side of this important question, his opening talents were displayed to no common advantage, and he was not only regarded as a promising speaker, but as destined at some future period to rank high in the councils of his native country. This was truly honourable to so young a man, when it is remembered that one horse could then boast of a Rockingham, a Richmond, and a Shelburne, and the other of a Savile, a Dunning, a Burke, a Barr\u00e9, and a Fox. Yet there was still room for our juvenile orator, and the recollection of the eloquence, the talents, and the meritorious services of his father, contributed greatly to fix the attention of mankind on the deportment of a favourite son.\n\nAbout this time the extent of the royal prerogative engaged the attention both of the parliament and the public, and a vote of the commons, \"that the influence of the crown had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished,\" plainly pointed to an object, whether real or imaginary, which occasioned a considerable degree of discontent. Mr Burke, then in the zenith of his popularity, encouraged by numerous symptoms of jealousy, once more brought forward his plan of economy, which being founded on a progressive retrenchment, appeared admirably calculated to diminish the influence of the crown. It is needless to add that it was opposed by the minister (Lord North), but it was ably supported by Mr Pitt, who forcibly ridiculed every objection that could be brought against it. The bill was rejected after a long debate, but afterwards introduced at a more auspicious period, and to a certain extent carried into effect.\n\nMr Fox having moved that ministers should immediately take every possible measure for concluding a peace with our American colonies, he was powerfully supported by Mr Pitt, whose commanding eloquence engaged the whole attention of the house, while he reproved the cruelty and impolicy of the contest with our colonies. He declared that it was conceived in injustice, nurtured and brought forth in folly, and its footsteps were marked with blood, slaughter, persecution, and devastation. Many handsome compliments were paid him by two eminent judges of real merit, we mean the lord advocate of Scotland (now Viscount Melville), and Mr Wilkes. The former, in particular, declared that his powerful abilities and brilliant eloquence were universally acknowledged proofs, that the astonishing extent and force of an exalted understanding had descended, in an hereditary line, from the late illustrious possessor of them, to a son equally endowed with all the fire, and strength, and grace of oratory.\nA more equal representation of the people in parliament was one of the principal objects to which the nation directed its attention, next to the American war. It was admitted to be the undoubted prerogative of the crown to declare war; but as the supplies were entrusted to the management of the representatives of the people, it was affirmed by some that ministers could not have carried on a contest accompanied with the waste of so much blood and treasure, had it not been owing to the corruption and venality of parliament. To derive advantage from past experience; to confer on the people their due importance in such a mixed government as that of Britain, and restore the constitution to its original purity, became by this time the grand object of Mr Pitt's exertions. He was, as yet untainted by the fascinating charms of power and authority, and considered a well-earned fame as the best, the only reward of his laudable endeavours. He accordingly brought the principles and conduct of his opponents to such a test as they successfully employed against himself, in order to wound his feelings, and convict him of inconsistency, by turning his back on his once favourite sentiments. When many cities and counties endeavoured to obtain a reform in parliament, Mr Pitt actually sat in a convention of delegates, met together in the neighbourhood of the place where the legislature held its sittings.\n\nThe American war in the mean time was drawing to a termination, and the spoils of the office of the former minister became the reward of those who opposed him. During the short existence of the Rockingham administration, contractors were excluded from the house of commons; officers belonging to the customs and excise were declared unqualified to vote at elections; the proceedings respecting the Middlesex election were rescinded; and while a more liberal policy was adopted with regard to Ireland, many superstitious offices were abolished in England by means of a reform bill, which tended powerfully to destroy corruption. Many more important reforms would have been accomplished, had not the death of the distinguished Rockingham brought about great and sudden changes.\n\nMr Fox retired in consequence of new arrangements, and Lord Shelburne, as first lord of the treasury, made choice of Mr Pitt as chancellor of the exchequer, who, declared, although only 23 years of age, that he would accept of no inferior office. Peace now seemed to be an object generally desirable at any rate, and without much regarding what sacrifices might be made in order to procure it; but the terms met with powerful opposition from two men formerly considered as mortal enemies, viz. Lord North and Mr Fox, the latter of whom retired from office. Soon after the dissolution of Mr Fox, Mr Pitt again brought forward the question respecting a reform in parliament, which he fondly hoped would be the means of restoring him to his wonted popularity, and pave the way to the increase of his power. He therefore submitted three different motions to the consideration of the house; but although in these motions he was ably supported, he was left in a minority.\n\nThe coalition ministry, as it was called, had still a considerable majority in parliament, notwithstanding the popularity belonging to the name and talents of Mr Pitt, but the celebrated India bill was productive of a change. This bill owed its origin to Mr Burke, but it received a regular and systematical opposition from the ex-chancellor of the exchequer. It was carried, however, in the house of commons by a great majority, but in the house of lords it was opposed by the duke of Richmond, Lord Thurlow, and Earl Temple (afterwards marquis of Buckingham); and on the 17th of December 1783, it was finally rejected by a majority of 19.\n\nThe king in the meantime determined on an entire change of administration, and the two secretaries were informed on the 18th of December 1783, about 12 o'clock at night, that his majesty had no further occasion for their services. In consequence of this change, the important offices of first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer were bestowed on Mr Pitt, who thus became prime minister before he was full 24 years of age. Thurlow was created lord chancellor, the duke of Richmond keeper of the privy seal; the marquis of Caernarvon then and Lord Sidney were chosen secretaries of state, and Mr Dundas, treasurer of the navy.\n\nMuch about this time Mr Pitt brought forward a new bill for the better government of India. He proposed that a board of control should be instituted, the nomination of whose members was to be vested in the crown, and to them the dispatches of the company were to be submitted. He also proposed that the appointment of the commander in chief should belong to his majesty, and having thus secured the political interests of the company, he left those of a commercial nature entirely to the court of directors. This bill, after a short debate, was rejected by a majority of eight. Such was the present temper of the house of commons, that a coalition or immediate dissolution became absolutely necessary; and the former having been unsuccessfully attempted, the latter was suddenly adopted, on the 25th of March 1784. Mr Pitt having been returned for the university of Cambridge, again brought forward his bill in an amended state for the regulation of India, and carried it in triumph through both houses of parliament. The remaining part of the session gave birth to an act for the better prevention of smuggling, and the commutation act, by virtue of which certain duties were transferred from tea to windows.\n\nWhen Mr Alderman Sawbridge (June 16th 1784) made a motion for inquiring into the present state of the commons of Great Britain in parliament, Mr Pitt, whose political sentiments had undergone a revolution, felt himself considerably embarrassed, as he was reminded that he had brought forward questions on the same subject upon a former occasion. Mr Pitt, however, declined it, on account of the pressure of public business, and observed that, in his opinion, the present was not the proper time for bringing forward the question, and that it might be urged with greater probability of success on some future occasion. He did not wish it to be discussed in a precipitate manner, yet the business itself should have every support he was able to afford it.\n\nHaving now attained the summit of power and influence as prime minister, Mr Pitt exercised every function of his important office, without any check or control. Possessed of a great majority in both houses of parliament, as well as in the cabinet, his whole deportment, in the language of his opponents, seems to have become lofty in the extreme; and he paid little or no regard to that popularity which he had formerly courted.\n\nA commercial treaty about this time was entered into with France, the terms of which have been generally acknowledged.\nacknowledged to be advantageous to Britain. Mr Pitt, who deserves great credit for giving the plan his countenance, adopted, much about the same time, another respecting the finances, from which he derived a high degree of reputation; and, as he pointed at a period when the national debt might, in all probability, be extinguished, the country, if it was not altogether satisfied, appeared to be at least contented under his administration; and it is not a little to the credit of his financial system, that his opponents, when in power, not only approved, but adopted and extended it.\n\nIn this manner a commercial country began again to flourish, by turning its attention to the arts of peace; but, during his administration, its prosperity was threatened to be interrupted by the preparations for an attack upon Russia at one time, and by an open rupture with Spain at another, relative to Nootka sound. In both cases, the blow was warded off by negotiation, and a good understanding restored. The restoration of the tradeholder, by the intervention of a Prussian army, and his strenuous opposition of the prince of Wales's appointment to the regency during the king's indisposition, were also two important measures pursued and discussed in the course of his ministry.\n\nSoon after the commencement of the French revolution, Mr Pitt deemed a war with that country inevitable. But for a full detail of the events of this war, see BATTAIN. Having held the reins of government during 18 years, Mr Pitt, and all the members of the cabinet, suddenly retired from office in 1801. On this occasion all parties appeared to rejoice at the appointment of Mr Addington; and France, from that moment, as some affect, seemed to have neither friends nor advocates in this island. When the articles of the treaty of Amiens were debated in the house of commons, Mr Pitt defended the new minister with the whole force of his abilities and influence.\n\nOn the 15th of March 1804, Mr Pitt made a direct attack on the administration; and the admiralty board was accused by him of imbecility. He zealously supported Mr Fox's proposition relative to the Irish militia bill for the national defence, which was lost on a division. The minister's majority having dwindled to 37, on the army of reserve suspension bill, Mr Addington and some of his friends retired, and the ex-minister resumed his former seat. When parliament met on the 15th of January 1805, Mr Pitt warmly defended the war with Spain; and, on the motion for an address, he had a majority of 207.\n\nBut, in the meantime, a gouty habit, the predisposing causes of which appear to have been hereditary, and which, perhaps, was increased by his own manner of living, seized on a constitution never very strong. It is alleged, by his opponents, that this, combined with the miscarriage of his schemes, and the aspect of affairs on the continent, preyed so much upon his mind, that he is said to have died of a broken heart, at his house near Putney, between four and five on Wednesday morning, January 23, 1806, in the 47th year of his age.\n\nAs a financier, no man has obtained more praise, who ever presided at the board of exchequer. During his ministry some of our manufactures languished, but many flourished, and our exports were greatly increased. As a speaker he was unrivalled, and his generous scorn of wealth must be admired. In 20 years his debts amounted only to 40,000l. They were paid out of the public purse. The house of commons also passed a vote, that the expenses of his funeral, and a monument to his memory, should be defrayed by the nation.","sp":202,"ep":205},{"h":"PITTAUS","t":"a native of Mitylene in Lesbos, was one of the seven wise men of Greece: his father's name was Hyrradus. With the assistance of the sons of Alcaeus, he delivered his country from the oppression of the tyrant Melanchrus; and in the war which the Athenians waged against Lesbos, he appeared at the head of his countrymen, and challenged to single combat Phrynon, the enemy's general. As the event of the war seemed to depend upon this combat, Pittacus had recourse to artifice; and when he engaged, he entangled his adversary in a net which he had concealed under his shield, and easily dispatched him. He was amply rewarded for this victory; and his countrymen, sensible of his merit, unanimously appointed him governor of their city with unlimited authority. In this capacity Pittacus behaved with great moderation and prudence; and after he had governed his fellow-citizens with the strictest justice, and after he had established and enforced the most salutary laws, he voluntarily resigned the sovereign power after having enjoyed it for 10 years, observing, that the virtues and innocence of private life were incompatible with the power and influence of a sovereign. His disinterestedness gained him many admirers; and, when the Mitylenians wished to reward his public services by presenting him with an immense tract of territory, he refused to accept more land than what should be contained in the distance to which he could throw a javelin. He died in the 70th year of his age, about 579 years before Christ, after he had spent the last 10 years of his life in literary ease and peaceful retirement.\n\nThe following maxims and precepts are ascribed to Pittacus: The first office of prudence is to foresee threatening misfortunes, and prevent them. Power discovers the man. Never talk of your schemes before they are executed; lest, if you fail to accomplish them, you be exposed to the double mortification of disappointment and ridicule. Whatever you do, do it well. Do not that to your neighbour which you would take ill from him. Be watchful for opportunities.\n\nMany of his maxims were inscribed on the walls of Apollo's temple at Delphi, to show to the world how great an opinion the Mitylenians entertained of his abilities as a philosopher, a moralist, and a man. By one of his laws, every fault committed by a man when intoxicated deserved double punishment.","sp":205,"ep":205},{"h":"PITTENWEEM","t":"a small town situated on the frith of Forth, towards the eastern extremity of the county of Fife in North Britain. It takes its name from a small cave in the middle of it, anciently called a queens; and is remarkable for nothing but the ruins of a religious house, which is sometimes called an abbey and sometimes a priory. Which of these is the proper denomination it is hardly worth while to inquire; but it appears from the arms of the monastery, still preserved over the principal gate, that the superior, by whatever title he was called, had the privilege of wearing a mitre. This edifice, which seems never to have been large, was, with other monuments of mistaken piety, alienated from the church at the Reformation; and what parts of it now remain are\nare put to very different uses. Some of the cells of the monks furnish habitations tolerably convenient for the servants of him who, in the case of change of property, has got possession of the lands which formerly belonged to them. That which seems to have been the granary is a decent parish church. The porch of the chapel, the only part of that building which exists, has been alternately employed as a stable and a slaughterhouse; and the meat killed there has been commonly exposed to sale in the lower part of the steeple of that edifice which is now dedicated to the offices of parochial devotion.\n\nHad the moralizing traveller*, who composed the beautiful and pathetic meditation on the ruins of Iona, considered to visit Pittenweem, he would not have viewed the abbey without emotion. Insignificant as the place at present is, it seems to have been of some consequence in the last century; and we are led to infer, from the following extract from the records, that the inhabitants were opulent, and that the town was fortified.\n\n\"Pittenweem, decimo quarto Feb. 1651. The bailies and council being convened, and having received information that his majesty is to be in progress with his court along the coast tomorrow, and to stay at Anstruther house that night, have thought it expedient, according to their bounden duty, with all reverence and due respect, and with all the same solemnity they can, to wait upon his majesty, as he comes through this his majesty's burgh, and invite his majesty to eat and drink as he passes; and for that effect hath ordained, that the morn afternoon the town's colours be put upon the belfry of the steeple, and that at three o'clock the bells begin to ring, and ring on still till his majesty comes hither, and passes to Anstruther: And sickly, that the minister be spoken to, to be with the bailies and council, who are to be in their best apparel, and with them a guard of 24 of the ablest men, with partizans, and other 24 with muskets, all in their best apparel, William Sutherland commanding as captain of the guard; and to wait upon his majesty, and to receive his highnesses at the West Port, bringing his majesty and court through the town, until they come to Robert Smith's* best carpet: and that George Hetherwick have in readiness, of fine flour, some great burns, and other wheat-bread of the best order, taken with sugar, cinnamon, and other spices fitting; and that James Richardson and Walter Airth have care to have ready eight or ten gallons of good strong ale, with Canary, sack, Rhenish wine, tent, white and claret wines, that his majesty and his court may eat and drink; and that in the mean time, when his majesty is present, the guard do diligently attend about the court; and so soon as his majesty is to go away, that a sign be made to Andrew Tod, who is appointed to attend the colours on the steeple head, to the effect he may give sign to those who attend the cannon of his majesty's departure, and then the hall thirty six cannons to be all foot at once.

It was considered as a poison, and as a remedy, according to its different mode of application. Our chief information concerning this caterpillar, is derived from M. Reaumur, who has attentively observed its manner of life. The animal cannot bear much cold, and is therefore never found in the higher latitudes. It is styled procectionary, because it never leaves its hold, where many families reside, till the evening, when it feeds in trains, led on by two or three, and this train leaves a ribbon of silk in its way; for those behind follow exactly the steps of those which preceded, and each leaves its fibre of silk. Their nests are found in autumn; they are produced in the middle of September, become torpid in December, and recover their strength again in spring. They then descend from the trees, plunge into the earth, and undergo their last change. It is the bombix pityocampa of Fabricius, (Manissa Insector, tom. ii. p. 114, No. 66.), and greatly resembled the procectionary caterpillar of the oak. The ancients used it as a vesicatory, and the acrimony seems to reside chiefly in a dust which is concealed in receptacles on its back. This is its offensive weapon, for it is thrown out at will, and produces very troublesome effects, though the hair of the animal and every part of its body seem to have a similar, but weaker power. The effect is also weaker in winter; but this may depend on the diminished irritability of the human body, as well as on the torpid state of the insect. Their silk is not sufficiently strong for the loom, and in hot water melts almost to a paste. In the earth it forms nests of stronger silk, but it is then found with difficulty: in boxes its silk is extremely tender. Adding to all these inconveniences, handling the cones produces all the bad effects of the dust. Matthiolus recommends them as a styptic, and perhaps they may serve for burning on the skin instead of moxa, the downy silk of a species of artemisia. The ancients, afraid of its hurtful qualities, used them with caution, and enacted laws against their being sold profanously: the modern planter is chiefly afraid of them, because they destroy the beauty of his trees, and he endeavours to collect the eggs by cutting off the branches, which are burnt immediately.","sp":206,"ep":206},{"h":"PIVAT'","t":"or PIVOT, a foot or shoe of iron or other metal, usually conical or terminating in a point, whereby a body, intended to turn round, bears on another fixed at rest, and performs its revolutions.

(Aeneas-Sylvius Piccolomini), was born on the 18th of October 1405, at Corfigni in the Sienese, the name of which he afterwards changed into that of Pienza. His mother Victoria Forteguerra, when she was with child of him, dreamed that she should be delivered of a mitred infant; and as the way of degrading clergymen at that time was by crowning them with a paper mitre, she believed that Aeneas would be a disgrace to his family. But what to her had the appearance of being a disgrace, was a prelude of the greatest honors. Aeneas was carefully educated, and made considerable proficiency in the belles lettres. After ha-\nPius ving finished his studies at Sienna, he went in 1431 to the council of Bale with Cardinal Capranica, named De Fermo, because he was entrusted with the government of that church. Aeneas was his secretary, and was then only 26 years of age. He afterwards acted in the same capacity to some other prelates, and to Cardinal Albergati. The council of Bale honoured him with different commissions, in order to recompense him for the zeal with which he defended that assembly against Pope Eugene IV. He was afterwards secretary to Frederic III, who decreed to him the poetical crown, and sent him ambassador to Rome, Milan, Naples, Bohemia, and other places. Nicholas V advanced him to the bishopric of Trieite, which he quitted some time after for that of Sienna. At last, after having distinguished himself in various negotiations, he was invested with the Roman purple by Calixtus III, whom he succeeded two years after, on the 27th of August 1458. Pius II now advanced to the holy see, made good the proverb, Honores mutant mores. From the commencement of his pontificate, he appeared jealous of the papal prerogatives. In 1460 he issued a bull, \"declaring appeals from the pope to a council to be null, erroneous, detestable, and contrary to the sacred canons.\" That bull, however, did not prevent the procurator-general of the parliament of Paris from appealing to a council in defence of the Pragmatic Sanction, which the pope had strenuously opposed. Pius was then at Mantua, whither he had gone in order to engage the Catholic princes to unite in a war against the Turks. The greater part of them had agreed to furnish troops or money; others refused both, particularly France, who from that moment incurred his holiness's aversion. That aversion abated under Louis XI, whom he persuaded in 1461 to abolish the Pragmatic Sanction, which the parliament of Paris had supported with so much vigour.\n\nThe following year 1462, was rendered famous by a controversy which took place between the Cordeliers and Dominicans, whether or not the blood of Jesus Christ was separated from his body while he lay in the grave. It was also made a question whether it was separated from his divinity. The Cordeliers affirmed that it was, but the Dominicans were of an opposite opinion. They called each other heretics; which obliged the pope to issue a bull, forbidding them under pain of censure to brand one another with such odious epithets. The bull which his holiness published on the 26th of April, retracting what he had written to the council of Bale when he was its secretary, did not redound much to his honour. \"I am a man (says he), and as a man I have erred. I am far from denying that a great many things which I have said and written may deserve condemnation. Like Paul, I have preached through deception, and I have persecuted the church of God through ignorance. I imitate the blessed Augustin, who having suffered some erroneous sentiments to creep into his works, retracted them. I do the same thing; I frankly acknowledge my ignorance, from a fear lest what I have written in my younger years should be the occasion of any error that might afterwards be prejudicial to the interests of the holy see. For if it be proper for any one to defend and support the eminence and glory of the first throne of the church, it is in a peculiar manner my duty, whom God, out of his mercy and goodness alone, without any merit on my part, has raised to the dignity of vicar of Jesus Christ. For all these reasons, we exhort and admonish you in the Lord, not to give credit to those writings of ours which tend in any degree to hurt the authority of the apostolic see, and which establish opinions that are not received by the Roman church. If you find, then, anything contrary to her doctrine, either in our dialogues, in our letters, or in other of our works, despite these opinions, reject them, and adopt our present sentiments. Believe me rather now that I am an old man, than when I addressed you in my earlier days. Esteem a sovereign pontiff more than a private person; except against Aeneas Sylvius, but receive Pius II.\" It might be objected to his holiness, that it was his dignity alone which had made him alter his opinion. He anticipates that objection, by giving a short account of his life and actions, with the whole history of the council of Bale, to which he went with Cardinal Capranica in 1431; \"but (says he) I was then a young man, and without any experience, like a bird just come from its nest.\" In the mean time, the Turks were threatening Christendom. Pius, ever zealous in the defence of religion against the infidels, forms the resolution of fitting out a fleet at the expense of the church, and of passing over into Asia himself, in order to animate the Christian princes by his example. He repaired to Ancona with a design to embark; but he there fell sick with the fatigue of the journey, and died on the 16th of August 1464, aged 59 years. Pius was one of the most learned men of his time, and one of the most zealous pontiffs; but being of an ambitious and pliant disposition, he sometimes sacrificed to that ambition. His principal works are, 1. Memoirs of the council of Bale, from the suspension of Eugenius to the election of Felix. 2. The history of the Bohemians, from their origin to the year 1458. 3. Two books on cosmography. 4. The history of Frederic III, whose vice-chancellor he had been. This performance was published in 1785 in folio, and is believed to be pretty accurate and very particular. 5. A treatise on the education of children. 6. A poem upon the passion of Jesus Christ. 7. A collection of 432 letters, printed at Milan, 1473, folio, in which are found some curious anecdotes. 8. The memoirs of his own life, published by John Gobelin Peronne his secretary, and printed at Rome in 4to in 1584. There is no doubt of this being the genuine production of that pontiff. 9. Historia rerum ubicumque gestarum, of which only the first part was published at Venice in 1477 in folio. His works were printed at Helmstadt in 1700, in folio, at the beginning of which we find his life. That verse of Virgil's Aeneid (lib. i. 382.) which begins thus,\n\nSum pious Aeneas,\n\nand the end of the following verse,\n\nfama super aethera notus,\n\nhave been applied to him.\n\nPius IV. (John Angel, Cardinal de Medicis), of a different family from that of Florence, was born at Milan in 1499. He was son to Bernardin de Medechini, and brother of the famous Marquis de Marignan, Charles V.'s general. He raised himself by his own merit, and filled several important offices under Popes Clement VII. and Paul III. Julius III. who had entrusted him with several legations, honoured him with a cardinal's hat.\nhat in 1549. After the death of Paul IV. he was advanced to St Peter's chair on the 23rd of December 1559. His predecessor had rendered himself detestable to the Romans, who treated his memory with every mark of indignity, and Pius IV. commenced his pontificate by pardoning them. He did not, however, extend the same clemency to the nephews of Pope Paul IV.; for he caused Cardinal Caraffe to be strangled in the cattle of St Angelo, and his brother, the prince de Palliano, to be beheaded. His zeal was afterwards directed against the Turks and heretics. In order to stop, if possible, the progress of these last, he renewed the Council of Trent, which had been suspended. He knew well (says Abbe de Choisy), that that council might make some regulations which would have the effect to lessen his authority; but, on the other hand, he perceived that great inconveniences might result from its not being assembled; and \"in the man (said he to his confidants) it is better to feel evil for once than to be always in dread of it.\" In 1561 he dispatched nuncios to all the Catholic and Protestant princes, to present them with the bull for calling that important assembly. An end was, however, put to it by the industry of his nephew, S. Charles Borromeus, in 1563; and, on the 26th of January the year following, he issued a bull for confirming its decrees. In 1565 a conspiracy was formed against his life by Benedict Acolti, and some other visionaries. Those madmen had taken it into their head that Pius IV. was not a lawful pope, and that after his death they would place another in St Peter's chair, with the title of Pope Angelicus, under whom errors might be reformed, and peace restored to the church. The conspiracy was discovered, and the fanatic Benedict put to death. This pontiff died a little time after, on the 9th of December 1565, aged 66 years, carrying to the grave with him the hatred of the Romans, whom his severity had exasperated. He was a man of great address, and very fruitful in his resources. He adorned Rome with several public edifices; but these ornaments tended greatly to impoverish it. If he was the instrument of raising his relations in the world, it must be allowed, at least, that the greater part of them did him honour.\n\nPius V. (S. Michael Ghilieri), born at Bofchi or Bofco, in the diocese of Fortona, on the 17th of January 1504, was, according to Abb\u00e9 de Choisy, son to a senator of Milan. He turned a Dominican friar. Paul IV. informed of his merit and virtue, gave him the bishopric of Sutri, created him cardinal in 1557, and made him inquisitor-general of the faith among the Milanese and in Lombardy; but the severity with which he exercised his office obliged him to quit that country. He was sent to Venice, where the ardour of his zeal met with still greater obstacles. Pius IV. added to the cardinal's hat the bishopric of Mondovi. After the death of that pontiff, he was advanced to St Peter's chair in 1566. The Romans expressed but little joy at his coronation: he was very sensible of it, and said, \"I hope they will be as sorry at my death as they are at my election;\" but he was mistaken. Raised by his merit to the first ecclesiastical preferment in Christendom, he could not divest himself of the severity of his character; and the situation in which he found himself rendered, perhaps, that severity necessary. One of his first objects was to repel the luxury of the clergy, the pride of the cardinals, and the licentious manners of the Romans. He caused the decrees of reformation enacted by the Council of Trent to be put in execution; he prohibited bull-baiting in the Circus; he expelled from Rome the women of the town; and allowed the cardinals to be prosecuted for their debts. The errors which overflowed the Christian world gave him great uneasiness. After having employed gentle and lenient measures in the reclaiming of heretics, he had recourse to severity, and some of them ended their days in the flames of the inquisition. He particularly displayed his zeal for the grandeur of the holy see in 1568, by ordaining that the bull In coena domini, which was published at Rome every year on Maunday Thursday, and which Clement XIV. suppressed, should be published likewise throughout the whole church. That bull, the work of several sovereign pontiffs, principally regards the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical and civil power. It anathematizes those who appeal from the decrees of popes to a general council; those who favour the appellants; the universities which teach that the pope is subject to a general council; the princes who would restrain the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, or who exact contributions from the clergy. It was rejected by all the sovereign states, excepting a very few. In 1580, some bishops having endeavoured to introduce it into their dioceses, the parliament caused their temporalities to be seized upon, and declared those guilty of high treason who should imitate the fanaticism of those prelates. Pius V. for some time meditated an expedition against the Turks. He had the courage to make war on the Ottoman empire, by forming a league with the Venetians and Philip II., king of Spain. This was the first time that the standard of the two keys was seen displayed against the crescent. The naval armies came to an engagement, on the 7th of October 1571, in Lepanto bay, in which the confederate Christian princes obtained a signal victory over the Turks, who lost above 30,000 men, and near 200 galleys. This success was principally owing to the pope, who exhausted both his purse and person in fitting out that armament. He died of the gravel six months after, on the 30th of April 1572, aged 68. He repeated often, in the midst of his sufferings, \"O Lord! increase my pains and my patience.\" His name will forever adorn the list of Roman pontiffs. It is true, that his bull against Queen Elizabeth, and his other bull in favour of the inquisition, with his rigorous prosecution of heretics both in France and Ireland, prove that he had more zeal than sweetness in his temper; but in other respects he possessed the virtues of a saint and the qualities of a king. He was the model of the famous Sixtus Quintus, to whom he gave an example of amassing in a few years such savings as were sufficient to make the holy see be regarded as a formidable power. Sultan Selim, who had no greater enemy than this pope, caused public rejoicings to be made at Constantinople for his death during the space of three days. The pontificate of Pius is also celebrated for the condemnation of Baius, the extinction of the order of Humilites, and the reformation of that of the Cistercians. He was canonized by Clement XI. in 1712. There are extant several of his letters, printed at Antwerp in 1649, in 4to. Felibian, in 1672, published his Life, translated from the Italian of Agatio di Somma; but we cannot vouch for the fidelity of the translation.\nPIX.

In its territory there are salt-springs, from which they make a very white salt; and there are also mines of iron, woods, and warrens. It contains a great number of merchants, and is reckoned three miles in circumference. Its fortifications are inconsiderable, but the citadel is pretty strong. The streets are straight, and the principal street called Stradone, is 25 common paces broad and 3000 feet long, in a direct line, with 600 stone posts, for separating the foot from the carriage-way, and on both sides are 11 spacious convents. The other buildings of the city are not very remarkable, though it contains 45 churches, 28 convents, and two almshouses. The cathedral is pretty much in the Gothic taste; but the church of the Augustines is reckoned the most beautiful, and esteemed worthy of its architect, the celebrated Vignoli. The ducal palace, though large, makes no great appearance externally; but within there are some good apartments. In the area before the town-house stand two admirable bronz statues of Alexander and Renatus IV. both of the house of Farnese, and dukes of Parma and Placentia. The bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of Milan. At this city begins the Via Emilia, which extends as far as Rimini on the Adriatic. The number of the inhabitants is about 30,000, among whom there are 2000 ecclesiastics. This city has been taken several times in the wars of Italy. The king of Sardinia took possession of it in 1744, it being ceded to him by the queen of Hungary; but it was taken from him in 1746, after a bloody battle. The French got possession of it in 1796. It has a famous university, and the inhabitants are much esteemed for their politeness. There is a great fair here every year on the 15th of April, which is much frequented.

Though it is generally defined a malignant fever, Diemerbrock thinks they ought to be distinguished, since the fever is not the essence of the disease, but merely a symptom or effect of it. See Medicine, No. 221.\n\nThe plague, as is generally agreed, is never bred or propagated in Britain, but always imported from abroad, especially from the Levant, Lesser Asia, Egypt, &c., where it is very common. Sydenham has remarked that it rarely infects this country oftener than once in 40 years, and happily we have been free of it for a much longer period.\n\nAuthors are not as yet agreed concerning the nature of this dreadful distemper. Some think that insects are the cause of it, in the same way that they are the cause of blights, being brought in swarms from other climates by the wind, when they are taken into the lungs in respiration; the consequence of which is, that they mix with the blood and juices, and attack and corrode the viscera. Mr. Boyle, on the other hand, thinks it originates from the effluvia or exhalations breathed into the atmosphere from noxious minerals, to which may be added stagnant waters and putrid bodies of every kind.\n\nMr. Gibbon thinks that the plague is derived from damp, hot, and stagnating air, and the putrefaction of animal substances, especially locusts. See Gibbon's Roman History, 4to edit. vol. iv. p. 327\u2014332, where there is also a very particular account of the plague which depopulated the earth in the time of the emperor Julian.\n\nThe Mahometans believe that the plague proceeds from certain spirits, or goblins, armed with bows and arrows, sent by God to punish men for their sins; and that when the wounds are given by spectres of a black colour, they certainly prove fatal, but not so when the arrows are shot by those that appear white. They therefore take no precaution to guard themselves against it. The wisest professors of this religion, however, at present act otherwise; for we find a receipt recommended by Sidi Mohammed Zerroke, one of the most celebrated Marabouts, prefaced with these remarkable words: \"The lives of us all are in the hands of God, when it is we must die. However, it hath pleased him to save many persons from the plague, by taking every morning while the infection rages, one pill or two of the following composition; viz. of myrrh two parts, saffron one part, of aloes two parts, of syrup of myrtle berries, &c.\" But this remedy is confined to the more enlightened; for the bigotry of the lower sort is so extreme as to make them despise all precautions which people of other nations use. Of this extreme and foolish prejudice Dr. Chandler gives an interesting account when speaking of the plague at Smyrna. This learned author is of opinion that the disease arises from animals, which he supposes to be invisible. See Chandler's Travels in Asia Minor, p. 279, &c.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact, that plagues are sometimes partial, and that they only attack particular animals, or a particular description of persons, avoiding others altogether, or attacking them but lightly. Thus Ferneius informs us of a plague, or murrain, in 1514, which invaded only cats. Dionysius Halicarnaeus mentions a plague which attacked none but maids; and that which raged in the time of Gentius, killed scarcely any women, and very few but lusty men. Boterus mentions another plague, which assaulted none but the younger sort; and we have instances of the same kind of a later standing (a). Cardan speaks of a plague at Baille, with which the Switzers were infected, and the Italians, Germans, or French, exempted: and John Utenhovius takes notice of a dreadful one at Copenhagen, which, though it raged among the Danes, spared the Germans, Dutch, and English, who went with all freedom, and without the least danger, to the houses of the infected. During the plague which ravaged Syria in 1760, it was observed that people of the fowdest constitutions were the most liable to it, and that the weak and delicate were either spared or easily cured. It was most fatal to the Moors; and, when it attacked them, it was generally incurable.\n\nWhen the plague raged in Holland in 1636, a young girl was seized with it, had three carbuncles, and was removed to a garden, where her lover, who was betrothed to her, attended her as a nurse, and slept with her as his wife. He remained uninfected, and the recovered, and was married to him. The story is related by Vine. Fabricius in the Life. Cur. Ann. II. Olst. 188.\n\nMany methods have been adopted in different countries to prevent the importation of this dreadful scourge of the human race, and to stop the progress of infection after it has been imported. In England, mayors, bailiffs, head officers of corporations, and justices of peace, have power to tax inhabitants, houses, and lands, &c. within their precincts, for the relief of persons infected with the plague; and justices of the county may tax persons within five miles round, on a parish's inability; the tax to be levied by distress and sale of goods, or in default thereof by imprisonment. Infected persons going abroad, after being commanded to keep house for avoiding farther infections, may be visited by watchmen, &c., and punished as vagrants, if they have no fires upon them; and if they have infectious sores on them it is felony. Justices of the peace, &c., are to appoint searchers, examiners, and buriers of the dead, in places infected, and administer oaths to them for the performance of their duties, &c.; flat. 1 Jac. I. cap. 31. See QUARANTINE.\n\nThe commission at Moscow having, in the year 1770, invented a fumigation-powder, which, from several other experiments, had proved efficacious in preventing the infection of the plague; in order more fully to ascertain its virtue in that respect, it was determined,\n\n(a) See the account of the yellow fever under the article PHILADELPHIA, where it appears that the disease was less fatal to some sorts of persons than to others.\nPlague. determined, towards the end of the year, that ten malefactors under sentence of death should, without undergoing any other precautions than the fumigations, be confined three weeks in a lazaretto, be laid upon the beds, and drestled in the clothes, which had been used by persons sick, dying, and even dead, of the plague in the hospital. The experiment was accordingly tried, and none of the ten malefactors were then infected, or have been since ill. The fumigation powder is prepared as follows.\n\nPowder of the first strength.] Take leaves of juniper, juniper-berries pounded, ears of wheat, guaiacum wood pounded, of each five pounds; common saltpetre pounded, eight pounds; sulphur pounded, five pounds; Smyrna tar, or myrrh, two pounds: mix all the above ingredients together, which will produce a pound of the powder of fumigation of the first strength. [N.B. A pound is 40 pounds Russian, which are equal to 35 pounds and a half or 36 pounds English avoirdupoise.]\n\nPowder of the second strength.] Take southernwood cut into small pieces, four pounds; juniper berries pounded, three pounds; common saltpetre pounded, four pounds; sulphur pounded, two pounds and a half; Smyrna tar, or myrrh, one pound and a half: mix the above together, which will produce half a pound of the powder of fumigation of the second strength.\n\nOdoriferous powder.] Take the root called kalmus cut into small pieces, three pounds; leaves of juniper cut into small pieces four pounds; frankincense pounded grossly, one pound; storax pounded, and rose flowers, half a pound; yellow amber pounded, one pound; common saltpetre pounded, one pound and a half; sulphur, a quarter of a pound: mix all the above together, which will produce nine pounds and three quarters of the odoriferous powder.\n\nRemark on the powder of fumigation.] If guaiacum cannot be had, the cones of pines or firs may be used in its stead; likewise common tar of pines and firs may be used instead of the Smyrna tar, or myrrh, and mugwort may supply the place of southernwood.\n\nThucydides, who was himself infected, lib. ii. gives us an account of a dreadful plague which happened at Athens about the year before Christ 430, while the Peloponnesians under the command of Archidamus waited all her territory abroad; but of these two enemies the plague was by far the most dreadful and severe.\n\nThe most dreadful plague that ever raged at Rome was in the reign of Titus, A.D. 80. The emperor left no remedy unattempted to abate the malignity of the distemper, acting during its continuance like a father to his people. The same fatal disease raged in all the provinces of the Roman empire in the reign of M. Aurelius, A.D. 167, and was followed by a dreadful famine, by earthquakes, inundations, and other calamities. The Romans believed that Ascalaphus sometimes entered into a serpent, and cured the plague.\n\nAbout the year 430 the plague visited Britain, just after the Picts and Scots had made a formidable invasion of the southern part of the island. The plague raged with uncommon fury, and swept away most of those whom the sword and famine had spared, so that the living were scarcely sufficient to bury the dead.\n\nAbout the year 1348 the plague became almost general over Europe. A great many authors give an account of this plague, which is said to have appeared first in the kingdom of Cathay in the year 1346, and to have proceeded gradually westward to Constantinople and Egypt. From Constantinople it passed into Greece, Italy, France, and Africa, and by degrees along the coasts of the ocean into Britain and Ireland, and afterwards into Germany, Hungary, Poland, Denmark and the other northern kingdoms. According to Antoninus archbishop of Florence the distemper carried off 60,000 people in that city, among whom was the historian John Villani.\n\nIn the year 1656 the plague was brought from Sardinia to Naples, being introduced into the city by a transport with soldiers on board. It raged with excessive violence, carrying off in less than six months 400,000 of the inhabitants. The distemper was at first called by the physicians a malignant fever; but one of them affirming it to be pestilential, the viceroy, who was apprehensive lest such a report would occasion all communication with Naples to be broke off, was offended with this declaration, and ordered him to be imprisoned. As a favour, however, he allowed him to return and die in his own house. By this proceeding of the viceroy, the distemper being neglected, made a most rapid and furious progress, and filled the whole city with consternation. The streets were crowded with confused processions, which served to spread the infection through all the quarters. The terror of the people increased their superstition; and it being reported that a certain nun had prophesied that the pestilence would cease upon building a hermitage for her sisters nuns upon the hill of St Martin's, the edifice was immediately begun with the most ardent zeal. Persons of the highest quality strove who should perform the meanest offices; some loading themselves with beams, and others carrying baskets full of lime and nails, while persons of all ranks stripped themselves of their most valuable effects, which they threw into empty hogheads placed in the streets to receive the charitable contributions. Their violent agitation, however, and the increasing heats, diffused the malady through the whole city, and the streets and the stairs of the churches were filled with the dead; the number of whom, for some time of the month of July, amounted daily to 15,000.\n\nThe viceroy now used all possible precautions to abate the fury of the distemper, and to prevent its spreading to the provinces. The infection, however, defoliated the whole kingdom, excepting the provinces of Otranto and the Farther Calabria, and the cities of Gaeta, Sorrento, Paolo, and Belvedere. The general calamity was increased in Naples by malecontents, who infamated that the distemper had been designingly introduced by the Spaniards, and that there were people in disguise who went through the city fowling poisoned dust. This idle rumour enraged the populace, who began to insult the Spanish soldiers, and threaten a sedition; so that the viceroy, to pacify the mob, caused a criminal to be broke upon the wheel, under pretence that he was a disperser of the dust. A violent and plentiful rain falling about the middle of August, the distemper began to abate; and on the eighth of December the physicians made a solemn declaration that the city was entirely free from infection.\n\nOf the dreadful plague which raged at London in\nthe year 1665, the reader will find an account in the article LONDON, No. 21. In 1720 the city of Marseille was visited with this destructive disease, brought in a ship from the Levant; and in seven months, during which time it continued, it carried off not less than 60,000 people. This defoliation is not yet obliterated from the minds of the inhabitants; some survivors remained alive but a few years ago to transmit a traditional account of it to after ages. There are two fine pictures, painted by Puget, representing some of the horrid scenes of that time. \"They are (says Lady Craven) only too well executed. I saw several dying figures taking leave of their friends, and looking their last, anxious, kind, and watchful prayers on their sick infants, that made the tears flow down my cheeks. I was told the physicians and noblemen who were afflicting the sick and dying, were all portraits: I can easily conceive it; for in some faces there is a look of reflection and concern which could only be drawn from the life.\" Letters, p. 34, 35. This fatal event has caused the laws of quarantine to be very strictly enforced in the lazaretto here, which is an extensive insulated building.\n\nThe ravages of this disease have been dreadful wherever it has made its appearance. On the first arrival of the Europeans at the island of Gran Canaria, it contained 14,000 fighting men, soon after which, two thirds of the whole inhabitants fell a sacrifice to the plague, which had doubtless been introduced by their new visitors. The destruction it has made in Turkey in Europe, and particularly in Constantinople, must be known to every reader; and its fatal effects have been particularly heightened there by that firm belief which prevails among the people of predestination, &c., as has been already mentioned. It is generally brought into European Turkey from Egypt; where it is very frequent, especially at Grand Cairo. To give even a list of all the plagues which have defoliated many flourishing countries, would extend this article beyond all bounds; and minutely to describe them all, would be impossible. For the plague at Smyrna, we refer to Chandler's Travels as above. Relating that which raged in Syria in 1762, we refer to the Abb\u00e9 Mariti's Travels through Cyprus, Syria, and Palestine, vol. i. p. 278\u2014296. This plague was one of the most malignant and fatal that Syria ever experienced; for it scarcely made its appearance in any part of the body when it carried off the patient.\n\nIn addition to what the reader will find upon this subject in the article MEDICINE, and the observations which have now been offered, we beg leave to state the sentiments of Berthier on this subject, in his account of Bonaparte's expedition into Syria.\n\n\"At the time of our entry into Syria, (says he) all the towns were infected by the plague; a malady which ignorance and barbarity render so fatal in the east. Those who are affected by it give themselves up for dead; they are immediately abandoned by every body, and are left to die, when they might have been saved by medicine and attention.\n\n\"Citizen Degenettes, principal physician to the army, displayed a courage and character which entitle him to the national gratitude. When our soldiers were attacked by the least fever, it was supposed that they had caught the plague, and these maladies were founded. The fever hospitals were abandoned by the officers of health and their attendants. Citizen Degenettes repaired in person to the hospitals, visited all the patients, felt the glandular swellings, drested them, declared and maintained that the distemper was not the plague, but a malignant fever with glandular swellings, which might easily be cured by attention, and keeping the patient's mind easy.\"\n\nThe views of Degenettes in making this distinction were worthy of the highest commendation; but Dr Mofley maintains that this fever was actually the plague. The physician, however, carried his courage so far, as to make two incisions, and to inoculate the suppuration matter from one of these buboes above his breast, and under his armpits, but was not affected with the malady. He thus eased the minds of the soldiers, the first step to a cure; and, by his fidelity and constant attendance in the hospitals, a number of men attacked with the plague were cured. His example was followed by other officers of health. \"There are, says Dr Mofley, annual or seasonal disorders, more or less severe, in all countries; but the plague, and other great depopulating epidemics, do not always obey the seasons of the year. Like comets, their course is eccentric. They have their revolutions; but from whence they come, or whether they go after they have made their revolution, no mortal can tell.\n\n\"Diseases originating in the atmosphere seize some, and pass by others; and act exclusively on bodies graduated to receive their impressions; otherwise whole nations would be destroyed. In some constitutions of the body the access is easy, in some difficult, and in others impossible.\n\n\"The air of confined places may be so vitiated as to be unfit for the purposes of the healthy existence of any person. Hence gaol, hospital, and ship fevers. But, as these distempers are the offspring of a local cause, that local cause, and not the distempered people, communicate the disease.\n\n\"The infection, were it not in the atmosphere, would be confined within very narrow limits; have a determinate sphere of action; and none but physicians and attendants on the sick would suffer; and these must suffer; and the cause and the effects would be palpable to our senses. Upon this ground, the precaution of quarantine would be rational. But who then would visit and attend the sick, or could live in hospitals, prisons, and lazarettos?\"\n\nThe author is convinced from these reasonings, that the bubo and carbuncle, of which we hear so much in Turkey, and read so much in our own history of plagues, arise from heating food and improper treatment; that they contain no infection; and consequently that they are not the natural deposit of the morbid virus separated from the contagion.\n\nSpeaking of the plague, Mr Brown says, \"the first symptoms are said to be thirst; 2. Cephalalgia; 3. A stiff and uneasy sensation, with redness and tumour about the eyes; 4. Watering of the eyes; 5. White pustules on the tongue. Not uncommonly, all these have successively shown themselves, yet the patient has recovered; in which case, where suppuration has had place, the skin always remains discoloured, commonly of a purple hue. Many who have been bled in an early stage of the disorder, have recovered without any fatal symptoms;\"\nsymptoms; but whether from that or any other cause, does not appear certain.\"\n\nOil rubbed into the skin acts as a preventive, as well as a cure of the plague. When the operation is performed to prevent infection, it is successfully performed with that view at Smyrna, as often as the plague makes its appearance in the city. As it is not done for the purpose of promoting perspiration, it is not requisite that it should be performed with the same speed as when for curing the disorder; nor is it necessary to abstain from flesh, and to use soups; but it will be proper to use only fowls or veal for some days, without any seasoning. It will in fine be necessary to guard against indigestible food, and such liquors as might put in motion or inflame the maws of the blood.\n\nThis interesting discovery merits the attention of all medical men; for if olive oil has been found efficacious in curing or preserving against one species of infection, it is not absurd to suppose, that the same or other kinds of oil might be productive of much benefit in other malignant infectious diseases. We hope soon to hear of some trial being made with it in this country.

The primary ones, called by way of eminence planets, are those which revolve round the sun as a centre; and the secondary planets, more usually called satellites or moons, are those which revolve round a primary planet as a centre, and constantly attend it in its revolution round the sun.\nThe primary planets are again distinguished into superior and inferior. The superior planets are those farther from the sun than our earth; as Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus; and the inferior planets are those nearer the sun than our earth, as Venus and Mercury. For an account of the planets lately discovered, see Vesta.\n\nThat the planets are opaque bodies, like our earth, is thought probable for the following reasons. 1. Since in Venus, Mercury, and Mars, only that part of the disk illuminated by the sun is found to shine; and again, Venus and Mercury, when between the earth and the sun, appear like dark spots or macules on the sun's disk; it is evident, that Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are opaque bodies, illuminated with the borrowed light of the sun. And the same appears of Jupiter, from its being void of light in that part to which the shadow of the satellites reaches, as well as in that part turned from the sun; and that his satellites are opaque, and reflect the sun's light, is abundantly shown. Again, since Saturn, with his ring and satellites, only yield a faint light, fainter considerably than that of the fixed stars, though these be vastly more remote, and than that of the rest of the planets; it is past doubt that he too with his attendants are opaque bodies. 2. Since the sun's light is not transmitted through Mercury and Venus, when placed against him, it is plain they are dense opaque bodies; which is likewise evident of Jupiter, from his hiding the satellites in his shadow; and therefore, by analogy, the same may be concluded of Saturn. 3. From the variable spots of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, it is evident these planets have a changeable atmosphere; which changeable atmosphere may, by a like argument, be inferred of the satellites of Jupiter; and therefore, by similitude, the same may be concluded of the other planets. 4. In like manner, from the mountains observed in Venus, the same may be supposed in the other planets. 5. Since, then, Saturn, Jupiter, and the satellites of both, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are opaque bodies shining with the sun's borrowed light, are furnished with mountains, and encompassed with a changeable atmosphere; they have, it is concluded, waters, seas, &c. as well as dry land, and are bodies like the moon, and therefore like the earth.

A total inattention to the structure and economy of plants is the chief reason of the small progress that has been made in the principles of vegetation, and of the instability and fluctuation of our theories concerning it; for which reason we shall give a short description of the structure of plants, beginning with the seed, and tracing its progress and evolution to a state of maturity.\n\n1. Of Seeds.] The seeds of plants are of various figures and sizes. Most of them are divided into two lobes; though some, as those of the cereals-kind, have five; and others, as the grains of corn, are not divided, but entire.\n\nBut as the essential properties of all seeds are the same, when considered with regard to the principles of vegetation, our particular descriptions shall be limited to one seed, viz. the great garden-bean. Neither is the choice of this seed altogether arbitrary; for, after it begins to vegetate, its parts are more conspicuous than many others, and consequently better calculated for investigation.\n\nThis seed is covered with two coats or membranes. The outer coat is extremely thin, and full of pores; but may be easily separated from the inner one (which is much thicker), after the bean has been boiled, or lain a few days in the soil. At the thick end of the bean there is a small hole visible to the naked eye, immediately over the radicle or future root, that it may have a free passage into the soil (fig. 1. A). When these coats are taken off, the body of the seed appears, which is divid-\ned into two smooth portions or lobes. The smoothness of the lobes is owing to a thin film or cuticle with which they are covered.\n\nAt the basis of the bean is placed the radicle or future root (fig. 3. A). The trunk of the radicle, just as it enters into the body of the feed, divides into two capital branches, one of which is inserted into each lobe, and sends off smaller ones in all directions through the whole substance of the lobes (fig. 4. AA). These ramifications become so extremely minute towards the edges of the lobes, that they require the finest glasses to render them visible. To these ramifications Grew and Malpighi have given the name of seminal root; because, by means of it, the radicle and plume, before they are expanded, derive their principal nourishment.\n\nThe plume, bud, or germ (fig. 3.), is inclosed in two small corresponding cavities in each lobe. Its colour and consistence is much the same with those of the radicle, of which it is only a continuation, but having a quite contrary direction; for the radicle descends into the earth, and divides into a great number of smaller branches or filaments; but the plume ascends into the open air, and unfolds itself into all the beautiful variety of stem, branches, leaves, flower, fruit, &c. The plume in corn shoots from the smaller end of the grain, and amongst maltsters goes by the name of acrospire.\n\nThe next thing to be taken notice of is the substance or parenchymatous part of the lobes. This is not a mere concreted juice, but is curiously organized, and consists of a vast number of small bladders resembling those in the pith of trees (fig. 5.).\n\nBesides the coats, cuticle, and parenchymatous parts, there is a substance perfectly distinct from these, distributed in different proportions through the radicle, plume, and lobes. This inner substance appears very plainly in a transverse section of the radicle or plume. Towards the extremity of the radicle it is one entire trunk; but higher up it divides into three branches; the middle one runs directly up to the plume, and the other two pass into the lobes on each side, and spread out into a great variety of small branches through the whole body of the lobes (fig. 4.). This substance is very properly termed the seminal root: for when the seed is sown, the moisture is first absorbed by the outer coats, which are everywhere furnished with sap and air-vesicles; from these it is conveyed to the cuticle; from the cuticle it proceeds to the pulpy part of the lobes; when it has got thus far, it is taken up by the mouths of the small branches of the seminal root, and passes from one branch into another, till it is all collected into the main trunk, which communicates both with the plume and radicle, the two principal involved organs of the future plant. After this the sap or vegetable food runs in two opposite directions: part of it ascends into the plume, and promotes the growth and expansion of that organ; and part of it descends into the radicle, for nourishing and evolving the root and its various filaments. Thus the plume and radicle continue their progress in opposite directions till the plant arrives at maturity.\n\nIt is here worth remarking, that every plant is really possessed of two roots, both of which are contained in the feed. The plume and radicle, when the seed is first deposited in the earth, derive their nourishment from the seminal root; but, afterwards, when the radicle begins to shoot out its filaments, and to absorb some moisture, not, however, in a sufficient quantity to supply the exigencies of the plume, the two lobes, or main body of the feed, rise along with the plume, affuming the appearance of two leaves, resembling the lobes of the feed in size and shape, but having no resemblance to those of the plume, for which reason they have got the name of dissimilar leaves.\n\nThese dissimilar leaves defend the young plume from the injuries of the weather, and at the same time, by absorbing dew, air, &c., assist the tender radicle in nourishing the plume, with which they have still a connection by means of the seminal root above described. But when the radicle or second root has descended deep enough into the earth, and has acquired a sufficient number of filaments or branches for absorbing as much aliment as is proper for the growth of the plume; then the seminal or dissimilar leaves, their utility being entirely superfluous, begin to decay and fall off.\n\nFig. 1. A, the foramen or hole in the bean through which the radicle shoots into the soil.\n\nFig. 2. A transverse section of the bean; the dots being the branches of the seminal root.\n\nFig. 3.

A, a transverse section of the radicle. B, a transverse section of the plume, showing the organs or vesicles of the seminal root.\n\nFig. 8. The appearance of the radicle, plume, and seminal root, when a little further advanced in growth.\n\nHaving thus briefly described the feed, and traced its evolution into three principal organic parts, viz. the plume, radicle, and seminal leaves, we shall next take an anatomical view of the root, trunk, leaves, &c.\n\n2. Of the root.] In examining the root of plants, the first thing that presents itself is the skin, which is of various colours in different plants. Every root, after it has arrived at a certain age, has a double skin. The first is coeval with the other parts, and exists in the feed; but afterwards there is a ring sent off from the bark, and forms a second skin; e.g. in the root of the dandelion, towards the end of May, the original or outer skin appears shrivelled, and is easily separated from the new one, which is fresher, and adheres more firmly to the bark. Perennial plants are supplied in this manner with a new skin every year; the outer one always falls off in the autumn and winter, and a new one is formed from the bark in the succeeding spring. The skin has numerous cells or vesicles, and is a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle. However, it does not consist solely of parenchyma; for the microscope shows that there are many tubular ligneous vessels interposed through it.\n\nWhen the skin is removed, the true cortical substance or bark appears, which is also a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle, but greatly augmented. The bark is of very different sizes. In most trees it is exceeding thin in proportion to the wood and pith. On the other hand, in carrots, it is almost one-half of the semidiameter of the root; and, in dandelion, it is nearly twice as thick as the woody part.\nThe bark is composed of two substances; the parenchyma or pulp, which is the principal part, and a few woody fibres. The parenchyma is exceedingly porous, and has a great resemblance to a sponge; for it shrivels considerably when dried, and dilates to its former dimensions when infused in water. These pores or vessels are not pervious, so as to communicate with each other; but consist of distinct little cells or bladders, scarcely visible without the assistance of the microscope. In all roots, these cells are constantly filled with a thin watery liquor. They are generally of a spherical figure; though in some roots, as the bugloss and dandelion, they are oblong. In many roots, as the horseradish, peony, asparagus, potato, &c., the parenchyma is of one uniform structure. But in others it is more diversified, and puts on the shape of rays, running from the centre towards the circumference of the bark. These rays sometimes run quite through the bark, as in lovage; and sometimes advance towards the middle of it, as in melilot and most of the leguminous and umbelliferous plants. These rays generally stand at an equal distance from each other in the same plant; but the distance varies greatly in different plants. Neither are they of equal sizes: in carrot they are exceedingly small, and scarcely discernible; in melilot and chervil, they are thicker. They are likewise more numerous in some plants than in others. Sometimes they are of the same thickness from one edge of the bark to the other; and some grow wider as they approach to the skin. The vessels with which these rays are amply furnished, are supposed to be air-vessels, because they are always found to be dry, and not so transparent as the vessels which evidently contain the sap.\n\nIn all roots there are ligneous vessels dispersed in different proportions through the parenchyma of the bark. These ligneous vessels run longitudinally through the bark in the form of small threads, which are tubular, as is evident from the rising of the pith in them when a root is cut transversely. These ligneous sap-vessels do not run in direct lines through the bark, but at small distances incline towards one another, in such a manner that they appear to the naked eye to be inoculated; but the microscope discovers them to be only contiguous, and braced together by the parenchyma. These braces or coagulations are very various both in size and number in different roots; but in all plants they are most numerous towards the inner edge of the bark. Neither are these vessels single tubes; but, like the nerves in animals, are bundles of 20 or 30 small contiguous cylindrical tubes, which uniformly run from the extremity of the root, without sending off any branches or suffering any change in their size or shape.\n\nIn some roots, as parsnip, especially in the ring next the inner extremity of the bark, these vessels contain a kind of lymph, which is freer than the sap contained in the bladders of the parenchyma. From this circumstance they have got the name of lymph-ducks.\n\nThese lymph-ducks sometimes yield a mucilaginous lymph, as in the comfrey; and sometimes a white milky glutinous lymph, as in the angelica, fennel, burdock, scorzonera, dandelion, &c. The lymph-ducks are supposed to be the vessels from which the gums and balsams are secreted. The lymph of fennel, when exposed to the air, becomes a clear transparent balsam; and that of the scorzonera, dandelion, &c., condenses into a gum.\n\nThe situation of the vessels is various. In some plants they stand in a ring or circle at the inner edge of the bark, as in asparagus; in others, they appear in lines or rays, as in borage; in the parsnip, and several other plants, they are most conspicuous towards the outer edge of the bark; and in the dandelion, they are disposed in the form of concentric circles.\n\nThe wood of roots is that part which appears after the bark is taken off, and is firmer and less porous than the bark or pith. It consists of two distinct substances, viz. the pulpy or parenchymatous, and the ligneous. The wood is connected to the bark by large portions of the bark inserted into it. These insertions are mostly in the form of rays, tending to the centre of the pith, which are easily discernible by the eye in a transverse section of most roots. These insertions, like the bark, consist of many vessels, mostly of a round or oval figure.\n\nThe ligneous vessels are generally disposed in collateral rows running longitudinally through the root. Some of these contain air, and others sap. The air-vessels are so called, because they contain no liquor. These air-vessels are distinguished by being whiter than the others.\n\nThe pith is the central part of the root. Some roots have no pith, as the stramonium, nicotiana, &c.; others have little or none at the extremities of the roots, but have a considerable quantity of it near the top. The pith, like every other part of a plant, is derived from the seed; but in some it is more immediately derived from the bark: for the insertions of the bark running in between the rays of the wood, meet in the centre, and constitute the pith. It is owing to this circumstance, that, among roots which have no pith in their lower parts, they are amply provided with it towards the top, as in columbine, lovage, &c.\n\nThe bladders of the pith are of very different sizes, and generally of a circular figure. Their position is more uniform than in the bark. Their sides are not mere films, but a composition of small fibres or threads; which gives the pith, when viewed with a microscope, the appearance of a piece of fine gauze or net-work.\n\nWe shall conclude the description of roots with observing, that their whole substance is nothing but a congeries of tubes and fibres, adapted by nature for the absorption of nourishment, and of course the extension and augmentation of their parts.\n\nFig. 9. A transverse section of the root of wormwood as it appears to the naked eye.\n\nFig. 10. A section of fig. 9, magnified. AA, the skin, with its vessels. BBBB, the bark.

EEEE, the rays of the wood, in which the holes are the air-vessels. N.B. This root has no pith.\n\n3. Of the Trunk, Stalk, or Stem.] In describing the trunks of plants, it is necessary to premise, that whatever is said with regard to them applies equally to the branches.\n\nThe trunk, like the root, consists of three parts, viz. the bark, wood, and pith. These parts, though substantially the same in the trunk as in the root, are in many cases very different in their texture and appearance.\nThe skin of the bark is composed of very minute bladders, interspersed with longitudinal woody fibres, as in the nettle, thistle, and most herbs. The outside of the skin is visibly porous in some plants, particularly the cane.\n\nThe principal body of the bark is composed of pulp or parenchyma, and innumerable vessels much larger than those of the skin. The texture of the pulpy part, though the same substance with the parenchyma in roots, yet seldom appears in the form of rays running towards the pith; and when these rays do appear, they do not extend above half-way to the circumference. The vessels of the bark are very differently situated, and defined for various purposes in different plants. For example, in the bark of the pine, the innermost are lymph-ducts, and exceedingly small; the outermost are gum or resiniferous vessels, destined for the secretion of turpentine; and are so large as to be distinctly visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe wood lies between the bark and pith, and consists of two parts, viz. a parenchymatous and a ligneous. In all trees, the parenchymatous part of the wood, though much diversified as to size and consistence, is uniformly disposed in diametrical rays, or insertions running between similar rays of the ligneous part.\n\nThe true wood is nothing but a congeries of old dried lymph-ducts. Between the bark and the wood a new ring of these ducts is formed every year, which gradually loses its softness as the cold season approaches, and towards the middle of winter is condensed into a solid ring of wood. These annual rings, which are distinctly visible in most trees when cut through, serve as natural marks to distinguish their age (fig. ii, i2.). The rings of one year are sometimes larger, sometimes less, than those of another, probably owing to the favourable or unfavourable effects of the season.\n\nThe pith, though of a different texture, is exactly of the same substance with the parenchyma of the bark, and the insertions of the wood. The quantity of pith is various in different plants. Instead of being increased every year like the wood, it is annually diminished, its vessels drying up, and affuming the appearance and structure of wood; insomuch that in old trees there is scarce such a thing as pith to be discerned.\n\nA ring of sap-vessels is usually placed at the outer edge of the pith, next the wood. In the pine, fig, and walnut, they are very large. The parenchyma of the pith is composed of small cells or bladders, of the same kind with those of the bark, only of a larger size. The general figure of these bladders is circular; though in some plants, as the thistle and borage, they are angular. Though the pith is originally one connected chain of bladders, yet as the plant grows old they shrivel, and open in different directions. In the walnut, after a certain age, it appears in the form of a regular transverse hollow division. In some plants it is altogether wanting; in others, as the fennel, nettle, &c., there is only a transverse partition of it at every joint. Many other varieties might be mentioned; but these must be left to the observation of the reader.\n\nFig. ii. A transverse section of a branch of ash, as it appears to the eye.\n\nFig. i2.

Of the Leaves.] The leaves of plants consist of the same substance with that of the trunk. They are full of nerves or woody portions, running in all directions, and branching out into innumerable small threads, interwoven with the parenchyma like fine lace or gauze.\n\nThe skin of the leaf, like that of an animal, is full of pores, which both serve for perspiration and for the absorption of dew, air, &c. These pores or orifices differ both in shape and magnitude in different plants, which is the cause of that variety of texture or grain peculiar to every plant.\n\nThe pulpy or parenchymatous part consists of very minute fibres, wound up into small cells or bladders. These cells are of various sizes in the same leaf.\n\nAll leaves, of whatever figure, have a marginal fibre, by which all the rest are bounded. The particular shape of this fibre determines the figure of the leaf.\n\nThe vessels of leaves have the appearance of inoculating; but, when examined by the microscope, they are found only to be interwoven or laid along each other.\n\nWhat are called air-vessels, or those which carry no sap, are visible even to the naked eye in some leaves. When a leaf is slowly broken, they appear like small woolly fibres, connected to both ends of the broken piece.\n\nPlate Fig. i3.

The same piece magnified, in which the vessels have the appearance of acrew.\n\nPlate Fig. i6. The appearance of these vessels as they exist in the leaf before they are stretched out.\n\n5. Of the Flower.] It is needless here to mention any thing of the texture, or of the vessels, &c., of flowers, as they are pretty similar to those of the leaf. It would be foreign to our present purpose to take any notice of the characters and distinctions of flowers. These belong to the science of Botany, to which the reader is referred.\n\nThere is one curious fact, however, which must not be omitted, viz. That every flower is perfectly formed in its parts many months before it appears outwardly; that is, the flowers which appear this year are not properly speaking the flowers of this year, but of the last. For example, mezzereon generally flowers in January; but these flowers were completely formed in the month of August preceding. Of this fact any one may satisfy himself by separating the coats of a tulip root about the beginning of September; and he will find that the two innermost form a kind of cell, in the centre of which stands the young flower, which is not to make its appearance till the following April or May. Fig. i8. exhibits a view of the tulip-root when dissected in September, with the young flower towards the bottom.\n\n6. Of the Fruit.] In describing the structure of fruits,\nA few examples shall be taken from such as are most generally known.\n\nA pear, besides the skin, which is a production of the skin of the bark, consists of a double parenchyma or pulp, sap, and air-vesicles, calcareous and acetylic.\n\nThe outer parenchyma is the same substance continued from the bark, only its bladders are larger and more succulent.\n\nIt is everywhere interspersed with small globules or grains, and the bladders reflect these grains as a kind of centres, every grain being the centre of a number of bladders. The sap and air-vesicles in this pulp are extremely small.\n\nNext the core is the inner pulp or parenchyma, which consists of bladders of the same kind with the outer, only larger and more oblong, corresponding to those of the pulp, from which it seems to be derived. This inner pulp is much sooner than the other, and has none of the small grains interspersed through it; and hence it has got the name of acetylic.\n\nBetween the acetylic and outer pulp, the globules or grains begin to grow larger, and gradually unite into a hard stony body, especially towards the corculum or stool of the fruit; and from this circumstance it has been called the calcareous.\n\nThese grains are not derived from any of the organic parts of the tree; but seem rather to be a kind of concretions precipitated from the sap, similar to the precipitation from wine, urine, and other liquors.\n\nThe core is a roundish cavity in the centre of the pear, lined with a hard woody membrane, in which the seed is inclosed. At the bottom of the core there is a small duct or canal, which runs up to the top of the pear; this canal allows the air to get into the core, for the purpose of drying and ripening the seeds.\n\nFig. 18, a transverse section of a pear, as it appears to the naked eye.

A the channel, or duct, which runs from the top of the pear to the bottom of the core.\n\nIn a lemon, the parenchyma appears in three different forms. The parenchyma of the rind is of a coarse texture, being composed of thick fibres, woven into large bladders. Those nearest the surface contain the essential oil of the fruit, which bursts into a flame when the skin is squeezed over a candle. From this outmost parenchyma nine or ten infusions or lamellae are produced, which run between as many portions of the pulp, and unite into one body in the centre of the fruit, which corresponds to the pith in trunks or roots. At the bottom and top of the lemon, this pith evidently joins with the rind, without the intervention of any lamellae. This circumstance shows, that the pith and bark are actually connected in the trunk and roots of plants, though it is difficult to demonstrate the connection, on account of the closeness of their texture, and the minuteness of their fibres. Many vesicles are dispersed through the whole of this parenchyma; but the largest ones stand on the inner edge of the rind, and the outer edge of the pith, just at the two extremities of each lamella.\n\nThe second kind of parenchyma is placed between the rind and the pith; is divided into distinct bodies by the lamellae; and each of these bodies forms a large bag.\n\nThese bags contain a third parenchyma, which is a cluter of smaller bags, distinct and unconnected with each other, having a small stalk by which they are fixed to the large bag. Within each of these small bags are many hundreds of bladders, composed of extremely minute fibres. These bladders contain the acid juice of the lemon.\n\nFig. 22, a longitudinal section of a lemon.

The method he took to accomplish his purpose was as follows.\u2014In the month of July, commonly the warmest season of the year, he took a large sunflower three feet and an half high, which had been purposely planted in a flower-pot when young. He covered the pot with thin milled lead, leaving only a small hole to preserve a communication with the external air, and another by which he might occasionally supply the plant with water. Into the former he inserted a glass tube nine inches long, and another shorter tube into the hole by which he poured in the water; and the latter was kept close stoppered with a cork, except when there was occasion to use it. The holes in the bottom of the pot were also stoppered up with corks, and all the crevices filled with cement.\u2014Things being thus prepared, the pot and plant were weighed for several days; after which the plant was cut off close to the leaden plate, and the flump well covered with cement. By weighing, he found that there perpired through the unglazed porous pot two ounces every 12 hours; which being allowed for in the daily weighing of the plant and pot, the greatest perspiration, in a warm day, was found to be one pound 14 ounces; the middle rate of perspiration, one pound four ounces; the perspiration of a dry warm night, without any sensible dew, was about three ounces; but when there was any sensible though small dew, the perspiration was nothing; and when there was a large dew, or some little rain in the night, the plant and pot was increased in weight two or three ounces.\n\nIn order to know what quantity was perspired from a square inch of surface, our author cut off all the leaves of the plant, and laid them in five several parcels, according to their several sizes; and then measured the surface of a leaf of each parcel, by laying over it a large lattice.\nlattice made with threads, in which each of the little squares was \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch; by numbering of which, he had the surface of the leaves in square inches; which, multiplied by the number of leaves in the corresponding parcels, gave the area of all the leaves. By this method he found the surface of the whole plant above ground to be 5616 square inches, or 39 square feet. He dug up another sunflower of nearly the same size, which had eight main roots, reaching 15 inches deep and sidewise, from the stem. It had besides a very thick bush of lateral roots from the eight main roots, extending every way in a hemisphere about nine inches from the stem and main roots. In order to estimate the length of all the roots, he took one of the main roots with its laterals, and measured and weighed them; and then weighed the other seven with their laterals; by which means he found the sum of all their lengths to be 1448 feet.\n\nSupposing then the periphery of these roots at a medium to be 0.131 of an inch, then their surface will be 2276 square inches, or 15.8 square feet; that is, equal to 0.4 of the surface of the plant above ground. From calculations drawn from these observations, it appears, that a square inch of the upper surface of this plant perspires \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) part of an inch in a day and a night; and that a square inch of the surface underground imbibes \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch in the same time.\n\nThe quantity perspired by different plants, however, is by no means equal. A vine-leaf perspires only \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch in 12 hours; a cabbage perspires \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch in the same time; an apple-tree \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) in 12 hours; and a lemon \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) in 12 hours.\n\nOf the circulation of the Sap in PLANTS.\u2014Concerning this there have been great disputes; some maintaining, that the vegetable sap has a circulation analogous to the blood of animals; while others affirm, that it only ascends in the day-time, and descends again in the night. In favour of the doctrine of circulation it has been urged, that upon making a transverse incision into the trunk of a tree, the juice which runs out proceeds in greater quantity from the upper than the lower part; and the swelling in the upper lip is also much greater than in the lower. It appears, however, that when two similar incisions are made, one near the top and the other near the root, the latter expends much more sap than the former. Hence it is concluded, that the juice ascends by one set of vessels and descends by another. But, in order to show this clearly, it would be necessary first to prove that there is in plants, as in animals, some kind of centre from which the circulation begins, and to which it returns; but no such centre has been discovered by any naturalist; neither is there the least provision apparently made by nature whereby the sap might be prevented from descending in the very same vessels through which it ascends. In the lacteal vessels of animals, which we may suppose to be analogous to the roots of vegetables, there are valves which effectually prevent the chyle when once absorbed from returning into the intestines; but no such thing is observed in the vessels of vegetables; whence it must be very probable, that when the propelling force ceases, the juice descends by the very same vessels through which it ascended.\u2014This matter, however, has been cleared up almost as well as the nature of the subject will admit of by the experiments of Dr Hales. These experiments are so numerous, that for a particular account of them we must refer to the work itself; however, his reasoning against the circulation of the sap will be sufficiently intelligible without them. \"We see (says he), in many of the foregoing experiments, what quantities of moisture trees daily imbibe and perspire: now the celerity of the sap must be very great, if that quantity of moisture must, most of it, ascend to the top of the tree, then descend, and ascend again, before it is carried off by perspiration.\n\n\"The defect of a circulation in vegetables seems in some measure to be supplied by the much greater quantity of liquor, which the vegetable takes in, than the animal, whereby its motion is accelerated; for we find the sunflower, bulk for bulk, imbibes and perspires 17 times more fresh liquor than a man, every 24 hours.\n\n\"Besides, Nature's great aim in vegetables being only that the vegetable life be carried on and maintained, there was no occasion to give its sap the rapid motion which was necessary for the blood of animals.\n\n\"In animals, it is the heart which sets the blood in motion, and makes it continually circulate; but in vegetables we can discover no other cause of the sap's motion but the strong attraction of the capillary sap-vessels, afflited by the brisk undulations and vibrations caused by the sun's warmth, whereby the sap is carried up to the top of the tallest trees, and is there perspired off through the leaves: but when the surface of the tree is greatly diminished by the loss of its leaves, then also the perspiration and motion of the sap is proportionably diminished, as is plain from many of the foregoing experiments: so that the ascending velocity of the sap is principally accelerated by the plentiful perspiration of the leaves, thereby making room for the fine capillary vessels to exert their vastly attracting power, which perspiration is effected by the brisk rarefying vibrations of warmth; a power that does not seem to be any ways well adapted to make the sap defend from the tops of vegetables by different vessels to the root.\n\n\"If the sap circulated, it must needs have been seen descending from the upper part of large gashes cut in branches let in water, and with columns of water pressing on their bottoms in long glass tubes. In both which cases it is certain that great quantities of water passed through the stem, so that it must needs have been seen descending, at the return of the sap downwards were by trufion or pulsion, whereby the blood in animals is returned through the veins to the heart; and that pulsion if there were any, must necessarily be exerted with prodigious force, to be able to drive the sap through the finer capillaries. So that, if there be a return of the sap downwards, it must be by attraction, and that a very powerful one, as we may see by many of these experiments. But it is hard to conceive what and where that power is which can be equivalent to that provision nature has made for the ascent of the sap in consequence of the great perspiration of the leaves.\n\n\"The instances of the jasmine-tree, and of the passion-tree, have been looked upon as strong proofs of the circulation of the sap, because their branches, which were far below the inoculated bud, were gilded: but we have many visible proofs in the vine, and other bleeding trees, of the sap's receding back, and pushing forwards alternately, at different times of the day and night. And there is great reason to think that the sap of all other trees, has such an alternate, receding, and progressive motion, occasioned by the alternacies of day and night, warm and cool, moist and dry.\"\n\"For the sap in all vegetables does probably recede in some measure from the tops of the branches, as the sun leaves them; because its rarefying power then ceasing, the greatly rarefied sap, and air mixed with it, will condense, and take up less room than they did, and the dew and rain will then be strongly imbibed by the leaves; whereby the body and branches of the vegetable which have been much exhausted by the great evaporation of the day, may at night imbibe sap and dew from the leaves; for by several experiments, plants were found to increase considerably in weight, in dewy and moist nights. And by other experiments on the vine, it was found that the trunk and branches of vines were always in an imbibing state, caused by the great perpiration of the leaves, except in the bleeding season; but when at night that perspiring power ceases, then the contrary imbibing power will prevail, and draw the sap and dew from the leaves, as well as moisture from the roots.\n\n\"And we have a farther proof of this by fixing mercurial gages to the stems of several trees which do not bleed, whereby it is found that they are always in a strongly imbibing state, by drawing up the mercury several inches: whence it is easy to conceive, how some of the particles of the gilded bud in the inoculated jefamaine may be absorbed by it, and thereby communicate their gilding miasmata to the sap of other branches; especially when, some months after the inoculation, the stock of the inoculated jefamaine is cut off a little above the bud; whereby the stock, which was the counteracting part to the stem, being taken away, the stem attracts more vigourously from the bud.\n\n\"Another argument for the circulation of the sap is, that some sorts of the grafts will infect and canker the stocks they are grafted on: but by mercurial gages fixed to fresh-cut stems of trees, it is evident that those stems were in a strongly imbibing state; and consequently the cankered stocks might very likely draw sap from the graft, as well as the graft alternately from the stock; just in the same manner as leaves and branches do from each other, in the vicissitudes of day and night. And this imbibing power of the stock is so great, where only some of the branches of a tree are grafted, that the remaining branches of the stock will, by their strong attraction, starve those grafts; for which reason it is usual to cut off the greatest part of the branches of the stock, leaving only a few small ones to draw up the sap.\n\n\"The influence of the ilex grafted upon the English oak, seems to afford a very considerable argument against a circulation. For, if there were a free uniform circulation of the sap through the oak and ilex, why should the leaves of the oak fall in winter, and not those of the ilex?\n\n\"Another argument against an uniform circulation of the sap in trees, as in animals, may be drawn from an experiment, where it was found by the three mercurial gages fixed to the same vine, that while some of its branches changed their state of protruding sap into a state of imbibing, others continued protruding sap; one nine, and the other thirteen days longer.\"\n\nTo this reasoning of Dr Hales we shall subjoin an experiment made by Mr Muffel of the Academy of Sciences at Rouen, which seems decisive against the doctrine of circulation. His account of it is as follows.\u2014\"On the 12th of January I placed several shrubs in pots against the windows of my hot-house, some within the house and others without it. Through holes made for this purpose in the panes of glass, I placed a branch of each of the shrubs, so that those in the inside had a branch without, and those on the outside one within; after this, I took care that the holes should be exactly closed and luted. This inverse experiment, I thought, if followed closely, could not fail affording sufficient points of comparison, to trace out the differences, by the observation of the effects.\n\n\"The 20th of January, a week after this disposition, all the branches that were in the hot-house began to disclose their buds. In the beginning of February there appeared leaves; and towards the end of it, shoots of a considerable length, which presented the young flowers. A dwarf apple-tree, and several rose-trees, being submitted to the same experiment, showed the same appearance then as they commonly put on in May; in short, all the branches which were within the hot-house, and consequently kept in the warm air, were green at the end of February, and had their shoots in great forwardness. Very different were those parts of the same tree which were without and exposed to the cold. None of these gave the least sign of vegetation; and the frosts, which was intense at that time, broke a rose-pot placed on the outside, and killed some of the branches of that very tree which, on the inside, was every day putting forth more and more shoots, leaves, and buds, so that it was in full vegetation on one side, whilst frozen on the other.\n\n\"The continuance of the frost occasioned no change in any of the internal branches. They all continued in a very brisk and verdant state, as if they did not belong to the tree which, on the outside, appeared in the state of the greatest suffering. On the 15th of March, notwithstanding the severity of the frost, all was in full bloom. The apple-tree had its root, its stem, and part of its branches, in the hot-house. These branches were covered with leaves and flowers; but the branches of the same tree, which were carried on the outside, and exposed to the cold air, did not in the least partake of the activity of the rest, but were absolutely in the same state which all trees are in during winter. A rose-tree, in the same position, showed long shoots with leaves and buds; it had even shot a vigorous branch upon its stalk; whilst a branch which passed through to the outside had not begun to produce anything, but was in the same state with other rose-trees left in the ground. This branch is four lines in diameter, and 18 inches high.\n\n\"The rose-tree on the outside was in the same state; but one of its branches drawn through to the inside of the hot-house was covered with leaves and rose-buds. It was not without astonishment that I saw this branch shoot as briskly as the rose-tree which was in the hot-house, whose roots and stalk, exposed as they were to the warm air, ought, it should seem, to have made it get forward than a branch belonging to a tree, whose roots, trunk, and all its other branches, were at the very time frost-nipped. Notwithstanding this, the branch did not seem affected by the state of its trunk; but the action of the heat upon it produced the same effect as if the whole tree had been in the hot-house.\"\n\nMemoires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.\naffection of perpendicularity observed in the stems or stalks of all plants, in the roots of many, and even in their branches, as much as possible. Though almost all plants rise a little crooked, yet the stems shoot up perpendicularly, and the roots hang down perpendicularly; even those, which by the declivity of the soil come out inclined, or those which are diverted out of the perpendicular by any violent means, again redress and straighten themselves and recover their perpendicularity, by making a second and contrary bend or elbow without rectifying the first. We commonly look upon this affection without any surprize; but the naturalist who knows what a plant is, and how it is formed, finds it a subject of astonishment.\n\nEach seed we know contains in it a little plant, already formed, and needing nothing but to be unfolded; the little plant has its root; and the pulp, which is usually separated into two lobes, is the foundation of the first food it draws by its root when it begins to germinate. If a seed in the earth therefore be disposed so as that the root of the little plant be turned downwards, and the stem upwards, and even perpendicularly upwards, it is easy to conceive that the little plant coming to unfold itself, its stalk and root need only follow the direction they have to grow perpendicularly. But we know that the seeds of plants, whether thrown of themselves or by man, fall in the ground at random; and among the great variety of situations with regard to the stalk of their plant, the perpendicular one upwards is but one. In all the rest, therefore, it is necessary that the stalk rectify itself, so as to get out of the ground: but what force effects this change, which is unquestionably a violent action? Does the stalk find a less load of earth above it, and therefore go naturally that way where it finds the least obstacle? Were this so, the little root, when it happens to be uppermost, must also follow that direction, and mount up.\n\nTo account for two such different actions, M. Dodart supposes that the fibres of the stalks are of such a nature, as to be contracted and shortened by the heat of the sun, and lengthened out by the moisture of the earth; and, on the contrary, that the fibres of the roots are contracted by the moisture of the earth, and lengthened by the heat of the sun. When the plantule therefore is inverted, and the root at the top, the fibres which compose one of the branches of the root are not alike exposed to the moisture of the earth, the lower part being more exposed than the upper. The lower must of course contract the most; and this contraction is again promoted by the lengthening of the upper, whereon the fun acts with the greatest force. This branch of the root must therefore recoil towards the earth, and, infusing through the pores thereof, must get underneath the bulb, &c. By inverting this reasoning we discover how the stalk comes to get uppermost.\n\nWe suppose then that the earth attracts the root to itself, and that the sun contributes to its descent; and, on the other hand, that the sun attracts the stem, and the earth contributes to send it towards the same. With respect to the straightening of the stalks in the open air, our author imagines that it arises from the impression of external causes, particularly the sun and rain. For the upper part of a stalk that is bent is more exposed to the rain, dew, and even the sun, &c. than the under; and these causes, in a certain structure of the fibres, both equally tend to straighten the part most exposed by the shortening they successively occasion in it; for moisture shortens by dwelling and heat by dilating. What that structure is which gives the fibres such different qualities, or whereon it depends, is a mystery as yet beyond our depth.\n\nM. de la Hire accounts for the perpendicularity of the stems or stalks of plants in this manner: he supposes that the root of plants draws a coarser and heavier juice, and the stem and branches a finer and more volatile one. Most naturalists indeed conceive the root to be the stomach of the plant, where the juices of the earth are utilized as to become able to rise through the stem to the extremity of the branches. This difference of juices supposes larger pores in the roots than the stalk, &c., and, in a word, a different concretion. This difference must be found even in the little invisible plant included in the seed; in it, therefore, we may conceive a point of separation; such as, that all on one side, for example the root, shall be unfolded by the groter juices, and all on the other side by the more subtle ones. Suppose the plantule, when its parts begin to unfold, to be entirely inverted, the root at the top, and the stalk below; the juices entering the root will be coarser, and when they have opened and enlarged the pores so as to admit juices of a determinate weight, those juices prefilling the root more and more will drive it downwards; and this will increase as the root is more extended or enlarged: for the point of separation being conceived as the fixed point of a lever, they will act by the longer arm. The volatile juices at the same time having penetrated the stalk, will give it a direction from below upwards; and, by reason of the lever, will give it more and more every day. The little plant is thus turned on its fixed point of separation till it become perfectly erect.\n\nWhen the plant is thus erected, the stalk should still rise perpendicularly, in order to give it the more firm biding, and enable it to withstand the effort of wind and weather. M. Parent thus accounts for this effect: If the nutritious juice which arrived at the extremity of a rising stalk evaporate, the weight of the air which encompasses it on all sides will make it ascend vertically; but if, instead of evaporating, it congeal, and remain fixed to that extremity whence it was ready to go off, the weight of the air will give it the same direction; so that the stalk will have acquired a final new part vertically laid over it, just as the flame in a candle held in any way obliquely to the horizon still continues vertical by the prelure of the atmosphere. The new drops of juice that succeed will follow the same direction; and as all together form the stalk, that must of course be vertical, unless some particular circumstance intervene.\n\nThe branches, which are at first supposed to proceed laterally out of the stalk in the first embryo of the plant, though they should even come out in an horizontal direction, must also raise themselves upwards by the constant direction of the nutritious juice, which at first scarcely meets any resistance in a tender supple branch; and afterwards, even though the branch grow more firm, it will act with the more advantage; since the branch, being become longer, furnishes it with a longer arm or lever. The slender action of even a little drop becomes very considerable by its continuity, and by the assistance of such circumstances. Hence may we account for that regular situation and direction of the branches,\nbranches, since they all make nearly the same constant angle of $45^\\circ$ with the stem, and with one another.\n\nM. Alltruc accounts for the perpendicularity of the stems, and their reduplicating themselves, thus: 1. He thinks the nutritious juice arises from the circumference of the plant, and terminates in the pith; And, 2. That fluids, contained in tubes either parallel or oblique to the horizon, gravitate on the lower part of the tubes, and not at all on the upper. Hence it follows, that, in a plant placed either obliquely or parallel to the horizon, the nutritious juice will act more on the lower part of the canals than on the upper; and by this means they will infuse more into the canals communicating therewith, and be collected more copiously therein: thus the parts on the lower side will receive more accretion and be more nourished than those on the upper, the extremity of the plant will therefore be obliged to bend upwards.\n\nThis principle brings the seed into its due situation at first. In a bean planted upside down, the plume and radicle may be seen with the naked eye shooting at first directly for about an inch; after which they begin to bend, the one downward, and the other upward. The same is the case in a heap of barley to be made into malt, or in a quantity of acorns laid to sprout in a moist place, &c. Each grain of barley and each acorn has a different situation; and yet every sprout tends directly upward, and every root downward, and the curvity or bend they make is greater or less as their situation approaches more or less to the direction wherein no curvature at all would be necessary. But two such opposite motions cannot possibly arise without supposing some difference between the two parts: the only one we know of is, that the plume is fed by a juice imported to it by tubes parallel to its sides, whereas the radicle imbibes its nourishment at every pore in its surface. When the plume therefore is either parallel or inclined to the horizon, the nutritious juice, feeding the lower parts more than the upper, will determine its extremes to turn upward, for the reasons before given. On the contrary, when the radicle is in the like situation, the nutritious juice penetrating through the upper part more copiously than through the under, there will be a greater accretion of the former than of the latter; and the radicle will therefore be bent downwards, and this mutual curvity of the plume and radicle must continue till such time as their sides are nourished alike, which cannot be till they are perpendicular.\n\nOf the Food of Plants.\u2014This hath been so fully discussed under the article Agriculture, that little remains to be said upon the subject in this place. The method of making deplogificated or vital air de novo, is now so much improved, that numberless experiments may be made with it both on animals and vegetables. It appears, indeed, that these two parts of the creation are a kind of counterbalance to one another; and the noxious parts or excrements of the one prove salutary food to the other. Thus, from the animal body continually pass off certain effluvia, which vitiate or phlogisticate the air. Nothing can be more prejudicial to animal life than an accumulation of these effluvia: on the other hand, nothing is more favourable to vegetables than those excrementitious effluvia of animals; and accordingly they greedily absorb them from the earth, or from the air. With respect to the excrementitious parts of living vegetables, the case is reversed. The purest plant air is the common effluvium which passes off from vegetables; and this, however favourable to animal life, is by no means so to vegetable; whence we have an additional proof of the doctrine concerning the food of plants delivered under the article Agriculture.\n\nWith regard to the effects of other kinds of air on vegetation, a difference of some consequence took place between Dr Priestley and Dr Percival. The former, in the first volume of his Experiments and Observations on Air, had asserted that fixed air is fatal to vegetable as well as to animal life. This opinion, however, was opposed by Dr Percival, and the contrary one adopted by Dr Hunter of York in the Georigal Essays, vol. v. The experiments related by these two gentlemen would indeed have been decisive, had they been made with sufficient accuracy. That this was the case, however, Dr Priestley denies; and in the 3d volume of his Treatise on Air has fully detected the mistakes in Dr Percival's Experiments; which proceeded in fact from his having used, not fixed air, but common air mixed with a small quantity of fixed air. His experiments, when repeated with the purest fixed air, and in the most careful manner, were always attended with the same effect, namely, the killing of the plant.\n\nIt had also been asserted by Drs Percival and Hunter, that water impregnated with fixed air was more favourable to vegetation than simple water. This opinion was likewise examined by Dr Priestley; however, his experiments were indecisive; but seem rather unfavourable to the use of fixed air than otherwise.\n\nAnother very remarkable fact with regard to the food of plants has been discovered by Dr Priestley; namely, that some of them, such as the willow, comfrey, and duckweed, are nourished by inflammable air. The first, he says, flourishes in this species of air so remarkably, that, \"it may be said to feed upon it with great avidity.\" This process terminates in the change of what remains of the inflammable air into phlogisticated air, and sometimes into a species of air as good as common air; or even better; so that it must be the inflammable principle in the air that the plant takes, converting it, no doubt, into its proper nourishment.\"\n\nWhat the followers of Stahl call phlogisticated air and inflammable air, are so closely allied to each other, that it is no wonder they should prove prolificuously for the food of plants. The reason why both are not agreeable to all kinds of plants, most probably is the different quantity of phlogistic matter contained in them, and the different action of the latent fire they contain; for all plants do not require an equal quantity of nourishment; and such as require but little, will be destroyed by having too much. The action of heat also is essentially necessary to vegetation; and it is probable that very much of this principle is absorbed from the air by vegetables. But if the air by which plants are partly nourished contains too much of that principle, it is very probable that they may be destroyed from this cause as well as the other; and thus inflammable air, which contains a vast quantity of that active principle, may destroy such plants as grow in a dry soil, though it preserves those which grow in a wet one. See Vegetation.\n\nDiffusion of Plants.\u2014So great are the prolific powers of the vegetable kingdom, that a single plant almost of any kind, if left to itself, would, in a short time, overrun\noverrun the whole world. Indeed, supposing the plant to have been only a single annual, with two seeds, it would, in 20 years, produce more than a million of its own species; what numbers then must have been produced by a plant whose seeds are so numerous as many of those with which we are acquainted? In that part of our work we have given particular examples of the very prolific nature of plants, which we need not repeat here; and we have made some observations on the means by which they are carried to distant places. This is a very curious matter of fact, and as such we shall now give a fuller account of it.\n\nIf nature had appointed no means for the scattering of these numerous seeds, but allowed them to fall down in the place where they grew, the young vegetables must of necessity have choked one another as they grew up, and not a single plant could have arrived at perfection. But so many ways are there appointed for the dissemination of plants, that we see they not only do not hinder each other's growth, but a single plant will in a short time spread through different countries. The most evident means for this purpose are,\n\n1. The force of the air.\u2014That the efficacy of this may be the greater, nature has raised the seeds of vegetables upon stalks, so that the wind has thus an opportunity of acting upon them with the greatest advantage. The seed-capsules also open at the apex, left the ripe seeds should drop out without being widely dispersed by the wind. Others are furnished with wings, and a papery down, by which, after they come to maturity, they are carried up into the air, and have been known to fly the distance of 50 miles: 138 genera are found to have winged seeds.\n\n2. In some plants the seed-vessels open with violence when the seeds are ripe, and thus throw them to a considerable distance; and we have an enumeration of 50 genera whose seeds are thus dispersed.\n\n3. Other seeds are furnished with hooks, by which, when ripe, they adhere to the coats of animals, and are carried by them to their lodging places. Linnaeus reckons 50 genera armed in this manner.\n\n4. Many seeds are dispersed by means of birds and other animals; who pick up the berries, and afterwards eject the seeds uninjured. Thus the fox disseminates the privet, and many species of fruit. The plants found growing upon walls and houses, on the tops of high rocks, &c., are mostly brought there by birds; and it is universally known, that by manuring a field with new dung, innumerable weeds will spring up which did not exist there before: 193 species are reckoned up which may be disseminated in this manner.\n\n5. The growth of other seeds is promoted by animals in a different way. While some are eaten, others are scattered and trodden into the ground by them. The squirrel gnaws the cones of the pine, and many of the seeds fall out. When the loxia eats off their bark, almost his only food, many of their seeds are committed to the earth, or mixed in the morass with moss, where he had retired. The glandularia, when she hides up her nuts, often forgets them, and they strike root. The same is observable of the walnut; mice collect and bury great quantities of them, and being afterwards killed by different animals, the nuts germinate.\n\n6. We are astonished to find moths, fungi, byssus, and mucor, growing everywhere; but it is for want of reflecting that their seeds are so minute that they are almost invisible to the naked eye. They float in the air like atoms, and are dropped everywhere, but grow only in those places where there was no vegetation before; and hence we find the same moths in North America and in Europe.\n\n7. Seeds are also dispersed by the ocean, and by rivers. \"In Lapland (says Linnaeus), we see the most evident proofs how far rivers contribute to deposit the seeds of plants. I have seen Alpine plants growing upon their shores frequently 36 miles distant from the Alps; for their seeds falling into the rivers, and being carried along and left by the stream, take root there.\u2014We may gather likewise from many circumstances how much the sea furthers this business.\u2014In R\u00f6llagia, the island of Graefea, Oeland, Gothland, and the shores of Scania, there are many foreign and German plants not yet naturalized in Sweden. The centaury is a German plant, whose seeds being carried by the wind into the sea, the waves landed this foreigner upon the coasts of Sweden. I was astonished to see the veronica maritima, a German plant, growing at Tornea, which hitherto had been found only in Graefea: the sea was the vehicle by which this plant was transported thither from Germany; or possibly it was brought from Germany to Graefea, and from thence to Tornea. Many have imagined, and erroneously, that seed corrupts in water, and loses its principle of vegetation. Water at the bottom of the sea is seldom warm enough to destroy seeds; we have seen water cover the surface of a field for a whole winter, while the seed which it contained remained unhurt, until at the beginning of spring the waters were let down so low by drains, that the warmth of the sun-beams reached to the bottom. Then the seeds germinate, but presently become putrefied; so that for the rest of the year the earth remains naked and barren. Rain and showers carry seeds into the cracks of the earth, streams, and rivers; which last, conveying them to a distance from their native places, plant them in a foreign soil.\"\n\n8. Lastly, some seeds affix their projection to a distance in a very surprising manner. The crupina, a species of centaury, has its seeds covered over with erect bristles, by whose affixture it creeps and moves about in such a manner, that it is by no means to be kept in the hand. If you confine one of them between the stocking and the foot, it creeps out either at the sleeve or neck-band, travelling over the whole body. If the bearded oat, after harvest, be left with other grain in the barn, it extricates itself from the glume; nor does it stop in its progress till it gets to the walls of the building. Hence, says Linnaeus, the Dalecarlian, after he has cut and carried it into the barn, in a few days finds all the glumes empty, and the oats separate from them; for every oat has a spiral arista or beard annexed to it, which is contracted in wet, and extended in dry weather. When the spiral is contracted, it drags the oat along with it: the arista being bearded with minute hairs pointing downward, the grain necessarily follows it; but when it expands again, the oat does not go back to its former place, the roughness of the beard the contrary way preventing its return. If you take the seeds of equisetum, or fern, these being laid upon paper, and viewed in a microscope, will be seen to leap over any obstacle as if they had feet; by which they are separated and dispersed one from another; so that a person ignorant of this\nthis property would pronounce these seeds to be so many mites or small insects.\n\nWe cannot finish this article without remarking, that many ingenious men believe that plants have a power of perception. Of this opinion we shall now give an account from the second volume of the Manchester Transactions, where we find some speculations on the perceptive power of vegetables by Dr Percival, who attempts to show, by the several analogies of organization, life, instinct, spontaneity, and self-motion, that plants, like animals, are endowed with the powers both of perception and enjoyment. The attempt is ingenious, and is ingeniously supported, but in our opinion fails to convince. That there is an analogy between animals and vegetables is certain; but we cannot from thence conclude that they either perceive or enjoy. Botanists have, it is true, derived from anatomy and physiology, almost all the terms employed in the description of plants. But we cannot from thence conclude, that their organization, though it bears an analogy to that of animals, is the sign of a living principle, if to this principle we annex the idea of perception; yet so fully is our author convinced of the truth of it, that he does not think it extravagant to suppose, that, in some future period, perceptivity may be discovered to extend even beyond the limits now assigned to vegetable life. Corallines, madreporites, millipores, and sponges, were formerly considered as fossil bodies; but the experiments of Count Marsigli evinced, that they are endowed with life, and led him to clasps them with the maritime plants. And the observations of Ellis, Jussieu, and Peyronel, have since raised them to the rank of animals. The detection of error, in long established opinions concerning one branch of natural knowledge, justifies the suspicion of its existence in others, which are nearly allied to it. And it will appear from the prosecution of our inquiry into the instincts, spontaneity, and self-moving power of vegetables, that the suspicion is not without foundation.\n\nHe then goes on to draw a comparison between the instincts of animals and those of vegetables; the calf, as soon as it comes into the world, applies to the teats of the cow; and the duckling, though hatched under a hen, runs to the water.\n\n\"B) Dr Watson, the bishop of Landaff, who has espoused the same side of the question with Dr Percival (see the 5th vol. of his Chemical Essays), reasons thus on the motions of vegetables. \"Whatever can produce any effect (says he) upon an animal organ, as the impact of external bodies, heat and cold, the vapour of burning sulphur, of volatile alkali, want of air, &c., are found to act also upon the plants called sensitive.\" But not to insist upon any more instances, the muscular motions of the dionaea muscipula, lately brought into Europe from America, seem far superior in quickness to those of a variety of animals. Now to refer the muscular motions of shell-fish and zoophytes to an internal principle of volition, to make them indicative of the perceptivity of the being, and to attribute the more notable ones of vegetables to certain mechanical dilatations and contractions of parts occasioned by external impulse, is to err against that rule of philosophizing which assigns the same causes for effects of the same kind. The motions in both cases are equally accommodated to the preservation of the being to which they belong, are equally distinct and uniform, and should be equally derived from mechanism, or equally admitted as criterions of perception.\n\n\"I am sensible that these and other similar motions of vegetables may by some be considered as analogous to the automatic or involuntary motions of animals; but as it is not yet determined amongst the physiologists, whether the motion of the heart, the peristaltic motion of the bowels, the contractions observable upon external impulse in the muscles of animals deprived of their heads and hearts, be attributable to an irritability unaccompanied with perceptivity, or to an uneasy sensation, there seems to be no reason for entering into to obscure a disquisition; especially since irritability, if admitted as the cause of the motions of vegetables, must a fortiori be admitted as the cause of the less exquisite and discernible motions of being universally referred to the animal kingdom.\"\ndownwards, in the middle glass vessel of Dr Nouth's machine, continued to thrive vigorously, without any other pabulum than what was supplied by the stream of mephitic gas to which it was exposed. In 24 hours the stem formed into a curve, the head became erect, and gradually ascended towards the mouth of the vessel; thus producing, by successive efforts, a new and unusual configuration of its parts. Such exertions in the sprig of mint, to rectify its inverted position, and to remove from a foreign to its natural element, seems to evince evolution to avoid what was evil, and to recover what had been experienced to be good. If a plant, in a garden-pot, be placed in a room which has no light except from a hole in the wall, it will shoot towards the hole, pass through it into the open air, and then vegetate upwards in its proper direction. Lord Kames relates, that, amongst the ruins of New Abbey, formerly a monastery in Galloway, there grows on the top of a wall a plane tree, 20 feet high. Straightened for nourishment in that barren situation, it several years ago directed roots down the side of the wall till they reached the ground ten feet below: and now the nourishment it afforded to these roots, during the time of descending, is amply repaid; having every year since that time made vigorous shoots. From the top of the wall to the surface of the earth, these roots have not thrown out a single fibre, but are now united into a pretty thick hard root.\n\n\"The regular movements by which the sunflower presents its splendid disk to the sun have been known to naturalists, and celebrated by poets, both of ancient and modern times. Ovid founds upon it a beautiful story; and Thomson describes it as an attachment of love to the celestial luminary.\n\n\"But one, the lofty follower of the sun,\nSad when he sets, flouts up her yellow leaves,\nDrooping all night; and when he warm returns,\nPoints her enamour'd bosom to his ray.\"\n\nDr Percival next touches on motion; he mentions co-\n* See Pen-\nnatulae, sea-pens*, oysters, &c., as endowed with the power\nmatuia, of motion in a very small degree, and then he speaks in\nthe following manner. \"Mr Miller (says he), in his late account of the island of Sumatra, mentions a species of coral, which the inhabitants have mistaken for a plant, and have denominated it talan-cout, or sea-grass. It is found in shallow bays, where it appears like a straight stick, but when touched withdraws itself into the sand. Now if self-moving faculties like these indicate ani-\nmality, can such a distinction be denied to vegetables, possested of them in an equal or superior degree? The water-lily, be the pond deep or shallow in which it grows, pushes up its flower-stems till they reach the open air, that the farina fecundans may perform without injury its proper office. About seven in the morning the stalk erects itself, and the flowers rise above the surface of the water: in this state they continue till four in the afternoon, when the stalk becomes relaxed, and the flowers sink and close. The motions of the sensitive plant have been long noticed with admiration, as exhibiting the most obvious signs of perceptivity. And if we admit such motions as criteria of a like power in other beings, to attribute them in this instance to mere mecha-\n\nnism, actuated solely by external impulse, is to deviate from the founded rule of philosophizing, which directs us not to multiply causes when the effects appear to be the same. Neither will the laws of electricity better solve the phenomena of this animated vegetable: for its leaves are equally affected by the contact of electric and non-electric bodies; show no change in their sensibility whether the atmosphere be dry or moist; and instantly close when the vapour of volatile alkali or the fumes of burning sulphur are applied to them. The powers of chemical stimuli to produce contractions in the fibres of this plant may perhaps lead some philosophers to refer them to the vis infusa, or irritability, which they assign to certain parts of organized matter, totally distinct from, and independent of, any sentient energy. But the hypothesis is evidently a fallacy, and refutes itself. For the presence of irritability can only be proved by the experience of irritations, and the idea of irritation involves in it that of feeling.\n\n\"But there is a species of the order of decandra, which constantly and uniformly exerts a self-moving power, uninfluenced either by chemical stimuli, or by any external impulse whatsoever. This curious shrub, which was unknown to Linnaeus, is a native of the East Indies, but has been cultivated in several botanical gardens here. I had an opportunity of examining it in the collection of the late Dr Brown. See HEDYSARUM.\u2014I cannot better comment on this wonderful degree of vegetable animation than in the words of Cicero. Inanimatum est omne quod pulsus agitur externo; quod autem est animal, id motu cietur interiore et suo.\n\n\"I have thus attempted, with the brevity prescribed by the laws of this society, to extend our views of animated nature; to gratify the mind with the contemplation of multiplied accessions to the general aggregate of felicity; and to exalt our conceptions of the wisdom, power, and beneficence of God. In an undertaking never yet accomplished, disappointment can be no disgrace: in one directed to such noble objects, the motives are a justification, independently of success. Truth, indeed, obliges me to acknowledge, that I review my speculations with much diffidence; and that I dare not presume to expect they will produce any permanent conviction in others, because I experience an instability of opinion in myself. For, to use the language of Tully, Nec si quomodo, dum lego, affinis; cum pulsi librum, affinis omnium illa elabitur.\u2014But this skepticism is perhaps to be ascribed to the influence of habitual preconceptions, rather than to a deficiency of reasonable proof. For besides the various arguments which have been advanced in favour of vegetable perceptivity, it may be further urged, that the hypothesis recommends itself by its consonance to those higher analogies of nature, which lead us to conclude, that the greatest possible sum of happiness exists in the universe. The bottom of the ocean is overpread with plants of the most luxuriant magnitude. Immense regions of the earth are covered with perennial forests. Nor are the Alps, or the Andes, destitute of herbage, though buried in deeps of snow. And can it be imagined that such profusion of life subsists without the least sensation or enjoyment? Let us rather, with humble reverence, suppose, that vegetables participate, in some low degree, of the common allotment of vitality; and that our great Creator hath apportioned\napportioned good to all living things, 'in number, weight, and measure.' See Sensitive Plant, Mimosa, Dionaea Mycetula, Vegetable Motion, &c.\n\nTo these ingenious and spirited observations, we shall subjoin nothing of our own, but leave our readers to determine for themselves (c). Speculations of this kind, when carried on by sober men, will never be productive of bad consequences; but by the subtle sceptic, or the more unwary inquirer, they may be made the engine of very dangerous errors. By this we do not mean to inferrinate that the spirit of inquiry should be suppressed, because that spirit, in the hands of weak or of wicked men, may be abused. By those, however, who know the bad consequences that may be drawn, and indeed that have been drawn, from the opinions we have now given an account of, our caution will not be deemed impertinent.\n\nPLANTS growing on Animals. See Insects giving root to Plants.\n\nSexes of PLANTS. See Sexes and Botany.\n\nColours of PLANTS. See Colour of Plants.\n\nColours extracted from PLANTS. See Colour-making.\n\nMethod of Drying and Preserving PLANTS for Botanists.\u2014Many methods have been devised for the preservation of plants: we shall relate only those that have been found most successful.\n\nFirst prepare a press, which a workman will make by the following directions. Take two planks of wood not liable to warp. The planks must be two inches thick, 18 inches long, and 12 inches broad. Get four male and four female screws, such as are commonly used for securing sash windows. Let the four female screws be let into the four corners of one of the planks, and corresponding holes made through the four corners of the other plank for the male screws to pass through, so as to allow the two planks to be screwed tightly together. It will not be amiss to face the bearing of the male screws upon the wood with iron plates; and if the iron plates went across from corner to corner of the wood, it would be a good security against the warping.\n\nSecondly, get half a dozen quires of large soft spongy paper (such as the stationers call blossom blotting paper is the best), and a few sheets of strong pasteboard.\n\nThe plants you wish to preserve should be gathered in a dry day, after the sun hath exhaled the dew; taking particular care to collect them in that state wherein their generic and specific characters are most conspicuous. Carry them home in a tin box nine inches long, four inches and a half wide, and one inch and a half deep. Get the box made of the thinnest tinned iron that can be procured; and let the lid open upon hinges. If anything happen to prevent the immediate use of the specimens you have collected, they will be kept fresh two or three days in this box much better than by putting them in water. When you are going to preserve them, suffer them to lie upon a table until they become limber; and then they should be laid upon a pasteboard, as much as possible in their natural form, but at the same time with a particular view to their generic and specific characters. For this purpose it will be advisable to separate one of the flowers, and to display the generic character. If the specific character depend upon the flower or upon the root, a particular display of that will be likewise necessary. When the plant is thus disposed upon the pasteboard, cover it with eight or ten layers of spongy paper, and put it into the press. Exert only a small degree of pressure for the first two or three days; then examine it, unfold any unnatural plats, rectify any mistakes, and, after putting fresh paper over it, screw the press harder. In about three days more separate the plant from the pasteboard, if it is sufficiently firm to allow of a change of place; put it upon a fresh pasteboard, and, covering it with fresh blossom paper, let it remain in the press a few days longer. The press should stand in the sunshine, or within the influence of a fire.\n\nWhen it is perfectly dry, the usual method is to fasten it down, with paste or gum water, on the right-hand inner page of a sheet of large strong writing-paper. It requires some dexterity to glue the plant neatly down, so that none of the gum or paste may appear to defile the paper. Press it gently again for a day or two, with a half sheet of blossom-paper betwixt the folds of the writing paper. When it is quite dry, write upon the left-hand inner page of the paper the name of the plant; the specific character; the place where, and the time when, it was found; and any other remarks you may think proper. Upon the back of the same page, near the fold of the paper, write the name of the plant, and then place it in your cabinet. A small quantity of finely powdered arsenic, or corrosive sublimate, is usually mixed with the paste or gum-water, to prevent the devastations of insects; but the seeds of slaves-acre finely powdered will answer the same purpose, without being liable to corrode or to change the colour of the more delicate plants. Some people put the dried plants into the sheets of writing paper, without fastening them down at all; and others only fasten them by means of small slips of paper, pasted across the stem or branches. Where the species of any genus are numerous, and the specimens are small, several of them may be put into one sheet of paper.\n\nAnother more expeditious method is to take the plants out of the press after the first or second day; let them remain upon the pasteboard; cover them with five or six leaves of blossom paper, and iron them with a hot smoothing\n\n(c) In the 2d volume of Transactions of the Linnaean Society, we find Dr Percival's reasoning very ably combated, as far as he draws his consequences from the external motions of plants; where it is argued, that these motions, though in some respects similar to those of animals, can and ought to be explained, without concluding that they are endowed either with perception or volition. Mr Townson concludes his paper in these words: \"When all is considered (says he), I think we shall place this opinion among the many ingenious flights of the imagination, and soberly follow that blind impulse which leads us naturally to give fenation and perceptivity to animal life, and to deny it to vegetables; and so still say with Aristotle, and our great master Linnaeus, Vegetabilia crescunt & vivunt; animalia crescunt, vivunt, & sentiunt.\"\nsmoothing iron until they are perfectly dry. If the iron be too hot, it will change the colours; but some people, taught by long practice, will succeed very happily. This is quite the best method to treat the orchis and other fleshy mucilaginous plants.\n\nAnother method is to take the plants when fresh gathered, and, instead of putting them into the press, immediately to fasten them down to the paper with strong gum water: then dip a camel-hair pencil into spirit-varnish, and varnish the whole surface of the plant two or three times over. This method succeeds very well with plants that are readily laid flat, and it preserves their colours better than any other. The spirit varnish is made thus. To a quart of highly rectified spirit of wine put five ounces of gum sandarach; two ounces of mastic in drops; one ounce of pale gum elemi, and one ounce of oil of spike-lavender. Let it stand in a warm place, and shake it frequently to expedite the solution of the gums.\n\nWhere no better convenience can be had, the specimens may be disposed systematically in a large folio book; but a vegetable cabinet is upon all accounts more eligible. With the affluence of the following description a workman may readily make one. The drawers must have backs and sides, but no other front than a small ledge. Each drawer will be 14 inches wide, and 10 inches from the back to the front, after allowing half an inch for the thickness of the two sides, and a quarter of an inch for the thickness of the back. The sides of the drawers, in the part next the front, must be sloped off in a serpentine line, something like what the workmen call an ogive. The bottoms of the drawers must be made to slide in grooves cut in the uprights, so that no space may be lost betwixt drawer and drawer. After allowing a quarter of an inch for the thickness of the bottom of each drawer, the clear perpendicular space in each must be as in the following table:\n\nI. Two tenths of an inch.\nII. One inch and two-tenths.\nIII. Four inches and six-tenths.\nIV. Two inches and three-tenths.\nV. Seven inches and eight-tenths.\nVI. Two inches and two-tenths.\nVII. Two tenths of an inch.\nVIII. One inch and four-tenths.\nIX. Two-tenths of an inch.\nX. Two inches and eight-tenths.\nXI. One inch and two-tenths.\nXII. Three inches and five-tenths.\nXIII. Two inches and four-tenths.\nXIV. Three inches and eight-tenths.\nXV. Three inches and four-tenths.\nXVI. One inch and three-tenths.\nXVII. Two inches and eight-tenths.\nXVIII. Six tenths of an inch.\nXIX. Ten inches.\nXX. One inch and nine-tenths.\nXXI. Four inches and four-tenths.\nXXII. Two inches and six-tenths.\nXXIII. One inch and two-tenths.\nXXIV. Seventeen inches.\n\nThis cabinet shuts up with two doors in front; and the whole may stand upon a base, containing a few drawers for the reception of duplicates and papers.\n\nFossil Plants. Many species of tender and herbaceous plants are found at this day, in great abundance, buried at considerable depths in the earth, and converted, as it were, into the nature of the matter they lie among; fossil wood is often found very little altered, and often impregnated with substances of almost all the different fossil kinds, and lodged in all the several strata, sometimes firmly imbedded in hard matter; sometimes loose: but this is by no means the case with the tenderer and more delicate subjects of the vegetable world. These plants are usually immersed either in a blackish flaky substance, found lying over the strata of coal, else in loose nodules of ferruginous matter of a pebble-like form, and they are always altered into the nature of the substance they lie among: what we meet with of these are principally of the fern kind; and what is very singular, though a very certain truth, is, that these are principally the ferns of American growth, not those of our own climate. The most frequent fossil plants are the polypody, spleenwort, osmund, trichomanes, and the several larger and smaller ferns; but besides these there are also found pieces of the equisetum or horse-tail, and joints of the filleted plants, as the clivers, madder, and the like; and these have been too often mistaken for flowers; sometimes there are also found complete grasses, or parts of them, as also reeds, and other watery plants; sometimes the ears of corn, and not unfrequently the twigs or bark, and impressions of the bark and fruit of the pine or fir kind, which have been, from their fealy appearance, mistaken for the skins of fishes; and sometimes, but that very rarely, we meet with moles and sea-plants.\n\nMany of the ferns not unfrequently found, are of very singular kinds, and some species yet unknown to us; and the leaves of some appear set at regular distances, with round protuberances and cavities. The stones which contain these plants split readily, and are often found to contain, on one side, the impression of the plant, and on the other the prominent plant itself; and, beside all that have been mentioned, there have been frequently supposed to have been found with us ears of common wheat, and of the maize or Indian corn; the first being in reality no other than the common endmost branches of the firs, and the other the thicker boughs of various species of that and of the pine kind, with their leaves fallen off; such branches in such a state cannot but afford many irregular tubercles and papillae, and, in some species, such as are more regularly disposed.\n\nThese are the kinds most obvious in England; and these are either immersed in the flaky stone which constitutes whole strata, or in flatted nodules usually of about three inches broad, which readily split into two pieces on being struck.\n\nThey are most common in Kent, in coal-pits near Newcastle, and the forest of Dean in Gloucestershire; but are more or less found about almost all our coal-pits, and many of our iron mines. Though these seem the only species of plants found with us, yet in Germany there are many others, and those found in different substances. A whitish stone, a little harder than chalk, frequently contains them: they are found also often in a gray flaky stone of a firmer texture, not unfrequently in a blackish one, and at times in many others. Nor are the bodies themselves less various here than the matter in which they are contained: the leaves of trees are found in great abundance, among which those of the willow, poplar, white thorn, and pear trees, are the most common; small branches of box, leaves of the olive tree, and stalks of garden thyme, are also found there; and sometimes ears of the various species of corn, and the larger as well as the smaller moles in great abundance.\n\nThese seem the tender vegetables, or herbaceous plants, certainly found thus immersed in hard stone, and buried","sp":214,"ep":233},{"h":"PLANT","t":"method of preserving them in their original shape and colour. With a sufficient quantity of fine sand, so as perfectly to separate it from all other substances; dry it; pass it through a sieve to clear it from any gross particles which would not rise in the washing; take an earthen vessel of proper size and form, for every plant and flower which you intend to preserve; gather your plants and flowers when they are in a state of perfection, and in dry weather, and always with a convenient portion of the stalk; heat a little of the dry sand prepared as above, and lay it in the bottom of the vessel, so as equally to cover it; lay the plant or flower upon it so that no part of it may touch the sides of the vessel; fill or shake in more of the same sand by little upon it, so that the leaves may be extended by degrees, and without injury, till the plant or flower is covered about two inches thick; put the vessel into a stove, or hot-house, heated by little and little to the 50th degree; let it stand there a day or two, or perhaps more, according to the thickness and succulence of the flower or plant; then gently shake the sand out upon a sheet of paper, and take out the plant, which you will find in all its beauty, the shape as elegant, and the colour as vivid as when it grew.\n\nSome flowers require certain little operations to preserve the adherence of their petals, particularly the tulip; with respect to which it is necessary, before it is buried in the sand, to cut the triangular fruit which rises in the middle of the flower; for the petals will then remain more firmly attached to the stalk.\n\nA hortus siccus prepared in this manner would be one of the most beautiful and useful curiosities that can be.\n\nMOVING PLANT.

In taking up the trees, carefully dig away the earth round the roots, so as to come at their several parts to cut them off; for if they are torn out of the ground without care, the roots will be broken and bruised, to the great injury of the trees. When you have taken them up, the next thing is to prepare them for planting by pruning the roots and heads. And first, as to the roots; all the small fibres are to be cut off, as near to the place from whence they are produced, as may be, except they are to be replanted immediately after they are taken up. Then prune off all the bruised or broken roots, all such as are irregular and cross each other, and all downright roots, especially in fruit-trees: shorten the larger roots in proportion to the age, the strength, and nature of the tree; observing that the walnut, mulberry, and some other tender-rooted kinds should not be pruned so close as the more hardy sorts of fruit and forest trees: in young fruit-trees, such as pears, apples, plums, peaches, &c. that are one year old from the time of their budding or grafting, the roots may be left only about eight or nine inches long; but in older trees, they must be left of a much greater length; but this is only to be underwood of the larger roots; for the small ones must be chiefly cut quite out, or pruned very short. The next thing is the pruning of their heads, which must be differently performed in different trees; and the design of the trees must also be considered. Thus, if they are designed for walls or espaliers, it is best to plant them with the greatest part of their heads, which should remain on till they begin to shoot in the spring, when they must be cut down to five or six eyes, at the same time taking care not to disturb the roots. But if the trees are designed for standards, you should prune off all the small branches close to the place where they are produced, as also the irregular ones which cross each other; and after having displaced these branches, you should also cut off all such parts of branches as have by any accident been broken or wounded; but by no means cut off the main leading shoots which are necessary to attract the sap from the root, and thereby promote the growth of the tree. Having thus prepared the trees for planting, you must now proceed to place them in the earth; but first, if the trees have been long out of the ground, so that the fibres of the roots are dried, place them eight or ten hours in water, before they are planted, with their heads erect, and the roots only immersed therein;\n\nfor that, by long duration, will convert the finest mould into stiff clay. The proprietor of such a soil must therefore grudge no labour to drain it well; and yet by such easy gradation as to prevent the mould from being washed away by great floods, in case the under stratum be a loam,\nwhich will swell the dried veffels of the roots, and prepare them to imbibe nourishment from the earth. In planting them, great regard should be had to the nature of the soil; for if that be cold and moist, the trees should be planted very shallow; and if it be a hard rock or gravel, it will be better to raise a hill of earth where each tree is to be planted, than to dig into the rock or gravel, and fill it up with earth, as is too often practised, by which means the trees are planted as it were in a tub, and have but little room to extend their roots. The next thing to be observed is, to place the trees in the hole in such a manner that the roots may be about the same depth in the ground as before they were taken up; then break the earth fine with a spade, and scatter it into the hole, so that it may fall in between every root, that there may be no hollows in the earth: then having filled up the hole, gently tread down the earth with your feet, but do not make it too hard; which is a great fault, especially if the ground be strong or wet. Having thus planted the trees, they should be fastened to stakes driven into the ground to prevent their being displaced by the wind, and some mulch laid upon the surface of the ground about their roots; as to such as are planted against walls, their roots should be placed about five or six inches from the wall, to which their heads should be nailed to prevent their being blown up by the wind. The reasons for planting are various, according to the different sorts of trees, or the soil in which they are planted. For the trees whose leaves fall off in winter, the best time is the beginning of October, provided the soil be dry; but if it be a very wet soil, it is better to defer it till the latter end of February, or the beginning of March; and for many kinds of evergreens, the beginning of April is by far the best season; though they may be safely removed at midsummer, provided they are not to be carried very far; but should always make choice of a cloudy wet season.\n\nIn the second volume of the papers, &c. of the Bath Society there is a letter on planting waste grounds. The gentleman who writes it informs us, that in the county of Norfolk, where he resides, there were about 60 or 70 years ago vast tracts of uncultivated ground, which were then thought totally barren. \"The western parts of it (says he) abounded with sand of so light a texture, that they were carried about by every wind; and in many places the sands were so loose that no grass could grow upon them. Art and industry, however, have now altered the face of this once Arabian desert, that it wears a very different appearance. Most of these tracts are either planted or rendered very good corn-land and sheepwalks.\n\n\"About 30 years since, the sides of many of our little sand-hills were fown with the seeds of French furze, and when a wet season followed, they succeeded very well, and grew so fast, that once in three or four years they are cut for fuel, and sell at a good price at Thetford, Brandon, Harling, Swaffham, and places adjacent. This excited some public-spirited gentlemen, among whom was the late Mr Buxton of Shadwell-Lodge, near Thetford, to attempt the planting of Scotch and spruce firs, and other hardy forest-trees. At first they found some difficulty from the extreme looseness of the sand. But as there is in all this part of the country fine white and yellow marle, at about three feet depth below the land, they very judiciously thought that incorporating it with the sand in the holes where their young trees were planted, would insure success; nor were they disappointed. The method succeeded beyond expectation; the plantations thrived exceedingly, and the roots soon reached below the sand, after which they were out of danger. This excited them to further attempts.\n\n\"On the spots where they intended to raise new plantations from seeds and acorns, they laid on a thick coat of marle and clay, which after being rough spread, and lying a winter in that state, was made fine, and ploughed in just before planting. By these means the soil became fixed, and in a little time covered with grass and herbage; so that there are now vast plantations of firs, oak, and forest-trees, in the most healthy and vigorous state, where within my memory ten acres of land would not maintain a single sheep three months.\n\n\"But the benefit of plantations, whether of shrubs, copses, or trees, is not confined to the immediate advantage, or even the future value of the wood. By annually feeding a great number of leaves, which the winds disperse, and the rains wash into the soil, it is considerably improved; and whenever such copses have been stubbed up, the ground (however unfruitful before planting) has thereby been so enriched as to bear excellent crops for many years, without the additional help of manure. How much land-owners are interested in planting waste or barren spots I need not mention; and nothing but a degree of indolence or ignorance unpardonable in this enlightened age could induce them to neglect it.\n\n\"Nature has furnished us with plants, trees, and shrubs, adapted to almost every soil and situation; and as the laws of vegetation are now much better understood than formerly, it is a reproach to those whose practice does not keep pace with their knowledge in making the best use of her bounty. Let no man repine and say the land is barren; for those spots which appear to be so, owe that appearance to human negligence. Industry and art might soon render an eighth part of this kingdom nearly as valuable as the rest, which now remains in a state unprofitable to the owners, and disgraceful to the community.\"\n\nRosse's PLANTING, a method of planting in which the natural position of the plant or shoot is inverted; the branches being set into the earth, and the root raised into the air. Dr Agricola mentions this monstrous method of planting, which he found to succeed very well in most all sorts of fruit-trees, timber-trees, &c. Bradley affirms, that he has seen a lime-tree in Holland growing with its first roots in the air, which had shot out branches in great plenty, at the same time that its first branches produced roots and fed the tree. Mr Fairchild of Hoxton has practised the same with us, and gives the following directions for performing it: Make choice of a young tree of one foot, of alder, elm, willow, or any other tree that easily takes root by laying; bend the shoot gently down into the earth, and so let it remain until it has taken root. Then dig about the first root, and raise it gently out of the ground, till the stem be nearly upright, and stake it up. Then prune the roots, now erected in the air, from the bruises and wounds they received in being dug up; and anoint the pruned parts with a composition of two ounces of turpentine, four ounces of tallow, and four ounces of beeswax, melted together, and applied pretty warm. Afterwards\nPlanudes, towards prune off all the buds or shoots that are upon the item, and dress the wounds with the same composition, to prevent any collateral shootings, that might spoil the beauty of the item.","sp":241,"ep":243},{"h":"PLANUDES","t":"MAXIMUS, a Greek monk of Constantinople, towards the end of the 14th century, who published a collection of epigrams intitled Anthologia; a Greek translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses; a Life of \u00c6lop, which is rather a romance than a history; and some other works. We know nothing more of him, than that he suffered some persecution on account of his attachment to the Latin church.\n\nPLASHING of HEDGES, is an operation thought by some persons to promote the growth and continuance of old hedges; but whether the fact be so or not will admit of some dispute. See HEDGES.\n\nIt is performed in this manner: The old stubs must be cut off, &c. within two or three inches of the ground; and the best and longest of the middle-sized shoots must be left to lay down. Some of the strongest of these must also be left to answer the purpose of stakes. These are to be cut off to the height at which the hedge is intended to be left; and they are to stand at ten feet distance one from another: when there are not proper shoots for these at the due distances, their places must be supplied with common stakes of dead wood. The hedge is to be first thinned, by cutting away all but those shoots which are intended to be used either as stakes, or the other work of the plashing: the ditch is to be cleaned out with the spade; and it must be now dug as at first, with sloping sides each way; and when there is any cavity on the bank on which the hedge grows, or the earth has been washed away from the roots of the shrubs, it is to be made good by facing it, as they express it, with the mould dug from the upper part of the ditch: all the rest of the earth dug out of the ditch is to be laid upon the top of the bank: and the owner should look carefully into it that this be done; for the workmen, to spare themselves trouble, are apt to throw as much as they can upon the face of the bank; which being by this means overloaded, is soon washed off into the ditch again, and a very great part of the work undone; whereas what is laid on the top of the bank always remains there, and makes a good fence of an indifferent hedge.\n\nIn the plashing the quick, two extremes are to be avoided; these are, the laying it too low, and the laying it too thick. The latter makes the sap run all into the shoots, and leaves the plashes without sufficient nourishment; which, with the thickness of the hedge, finally kills them. The other extreme of laying them too high, is equally to be avoided; for this carries up all the nourishment into the plashes, and so makes the shoots small and weak at the bottom, and consequently the hedge thin. This is a common error in the north of England. The best hedges made anywhere in England are those in Hertfordshire; for they are plashed in a middle way between the two extremes, and the cattle are by that prevented both from cropping the young shoots, and from going through; and a new and vigorous hedge soon forms itself.\n\nWhen the shoot is bent down that is intended to be plashed, it must be cut half way through with the bill: the cut must be given sloping, somewhat downwards, and then it is to be wound about the stakes, and after this its superfluous branches are to be cut off as they stand out at the sides of the hedge. If for the first year or two, the field where a new hedge is made can be ploughed, it will thrive the better for it; but if the stubs are very old, it is best to cut them quite down, and to fence them with good dead hedges on both sides, till the shoots are grown up from them strong enough to plash; and wherever void spaces are seen, new sets are to be planted to fill them up. A new hedge raised from sets in the common way, generally requires plashing in about eight or nine years after.","sp":243,"ep":243},{"h":"PLASSEY","t":"is a grove near the city of Muxadab in India, famous for a battle fought between the English under Lord Clive, and the native Hindoos under the nabob Surajah Dowlah.

See PARGETING and STUCCO.\n\nPLASTER of Paris, a preparation of several species of gypsum dug near Mount Martre, a village in the neighbourhood of Paris; whence the name. See ALABASTER, GYPSUM, and SULPHATE OF LIME, under CHEMISTRY.\n\nThe best sort is hard, white, shining, and marbled; known by the name of plaster-stone or parget of Mount Martre. It will neither give fire with steel, nor ferment with aquafortis; but very freely and readily calcines in the fire into a fine plaster, the use of which in building and casting statues is well known.\n\nThe method of representing a face truly in plaster of Paris is this: The person, whose figure is designed, is laid on his back, with any convenient thing to keep off the hair. Into each nostril is conveyed a conical piece of stiff paper, open at both ends, to allow of respiration. These tubes being anointed with oil, are supported by the hand of an afflatus; then the face is lightly oiled over, and the eyes being kept shut, alabaster fresh calcined, and tempered to a thinness consistence with water, is by spoonfuls nimbly thrown all over the face, till it lies near the thickness of an inch. This matter grows sensibly hot, and in about a quarter of an hour hardens into a kind of stony concretion; which being gently taken off, represents, on its concave surface, the minutest part of the original face. In this a head of good clay may be moulded, and therein the eyes are to be opened, and other necessary amendments made. This second face being anointed with oil, a second mould of calcined alabaster is made, consisting of two parts joined lengthwise.\nlengthwise along the ridge of the nose; and herein may be cast, with the same matter, a face extremely like the original.\n\nIf finely powdered alabaster, or plaster of Paris, be put into a basin over a fire, it will, when hot, assume the appearance of a fluid, by rolling in waves, yielding to the touch, foaming, &c., all which properties it again loses on the departure of the heat; and being thrown upon paper, will not at all wet it, but immediately discover itself to be as motionless as before it was set over the fire; whereby it appears, that a heap of such little bodies, as are neither spherical nor otherwise regularly shaped, nor small enough to be below the discernment of the eye, may, without fusion, be made fluid, barely by a sufficiently strong and various agitation of the particles which compose it; and moreover lose its fluidity immediately upon the cessation thereof.\n\nTwo or three spoonfuls of burnt alabaster, mixed up thin with water, in a short time coagulate, at the bottom of a vessel full of water, into a hard lump, notwithstanding the water that surrounded it. Artificers observe, that the coagulating property of burnt alabaster will be very much impaired or lost, if the powder be kept too long, especially if in the open air, before it is made use of; and when it hath been once tempered with water, and suffered to grow hard, they cannot, by any burning or powdering of it again, make it serviceable for their purpose as before.\n\nThis matter, when wrought into veils, &c., is still of so loose and spongy a texture, that the air has easy passage through it. Mr. Boyle gives an account, among his experiments with the air-pump, of his preparing a tube of this plaster, closed at one end and open at the other; and on applying the open end to the cement, as is usually done with the receivers, it was found utterly impossible to exhaust all the air out of it; for fresh air from without pressed in as fast as the other, or internal air, was exhausted, though the sides of the tube were of considerable thickness. A tube of iron was then put on the engine; so that being filled with water, the tube of plaster of Paris was covered with it; and on using the pump, it was immediately seen, that the water palled through into it as easily as the air had done, when that was the ambient fluid. After this, trying it with Venice turpentine instead of water, the thing succeeded very well; and the tube might be perfectly exhausted, and would remain in that state several hours. After this, on pouring some hot oil upon the turpentine, the case was much altered; for the turpentine melting with this, that became a thinner fluid, and in this state capable of palling like water into the pores of the plaster. On taking away the tube after this, it was remarkable that the turpentine, which had pervaded and filled its pores, rendered it transparent, in the manner that water gives transparency to that singular stone called oculus mundi. In this manner, the weight of air, under proper management, will be capable of making several forts of glues penetrate plaster of Paris; and not only this, but baked earth, wood, and all other bodies, porous enough to admit water on this occasion.\n\nPlaster of Paris is used as a manure in Pennsylvania, as we find mentioned in a letter from a gentleman in that country inserted in the fifth volume of the Bath Society Papers, and which we shall insert here for the satisfaction and information of our agricultural readers. \"The best kind is imported from hills in the vicinity of Paris; it is brought down the Seine, and exported from Havre de Grace. I am informed there are large beds of it in the bay of Fundy, some of which I have seen nearly as good as that from France; nevertheless several cargoes brought from thence to Philadelphia have been used without effect. It is probable this was taken from the top of the ground, and by the influence of the sun and atmosphere deprived of the qualities necessary for the purposes of vegetation. The lumps composed of flat shining specks are preferred to those which are formed of round particles like sand; the simple method of finding out the quality is to pulverize some, and put it dry into an iron pot over the fire, when that which is good will loom boil, and great quantities of the fixed air escape by ebullition. It is pulverized by first putting it in a flambing-mill. The finer its pulverization the better, as it will thereby be more generally diffused.\n\n\"It is best to sow it in a wet day. The most approved quantity for grass is six bushels per acre. No art is required in sowing it more than making the distribution as equal as possible on theeward of grass. It operates altogether as a top manure, and therefore should not be put on in the spring until the principal frosts are over and vegetation hath begun. The general time for sowing with us is in April, May, June, July, August, and even as late as September. Its effects will generally appear in ten or fifteen days; after which the growth of the grass will be so great as to produce a large burden at the end of six weeks after sowing.\n\n\"It must be sown on dry land, not subject to be overflowed. I have sown it on sand, loam, and clay, and it is difficult to say on which it has been answered, although the effect is sooner visible on sand. It has been used as a manure in this state for upwards of twelve years. Its duration may, from the best information I can collect, be estimated from seven to twelve years; for, like other manure, its continuance very much depends on the nature of the soil on which it is placed.\n\n\"One of my neighbours sowed some of his grasses on a field five years ago, another four years ago; a great part of my own farm was sown in May 1788. We regularly mow two crops, and pasture in autumn; no appearance of failure, the present crop being full as good as any preceding. I have this season mowed fifty acres of red clover, timothy grass, white clover, &c., which was plastered last May, July, and September; many who saw the grass eliminated the produce at two tons per acre, but I calculate the two crops at three tons. Several strips were left in the different fields without plaster; these were in a measure unproductive, being scarcely worth mowing. In April 1788, I covered a piece of grass land upwards of two inches thick with barn manure; in the same worn-out field I sowed plaster, to contrast it with the dung. I mowed the dugged and plastered land twice last year and once this; in every crop the plaster has produced the most. You will remember, in all experiments with clover, to mix about one-third timothy grass seed; it is of great advantage in serving as a support for the clover; it very much facilitates the curing of clover, and when cured is a superior fodder. The plaster operates equally as well on the other grasses as on clover. Its effect is said to be good on wheat, if sown in the spring; but I cannot say this from experience. On Indian corn I know its operation...\"\nto be great; we use it at the rate of a table spoonful for a hill, put in immediately after dressing.\n\n\"From some accurate experiments last year made and reported to our Agricultural Society, it appears that nine bushels of additional corn per acre were produced by this method of using plaster.\"\n\nPLASTERING. See Pargetting.","sp":243,"ep":245},{"h":"PLASTIC","t":"C denotes a thing endowed with a formative power, or a faculty of forming or fashioning a mass of matter after the likeness of a living being.\n\nPLASTIC-Nature, a certain power by which, as an instrument, many philosophers, both ancient and modern, have supposed the great motions in the corporeal world, and the various processes of generation and corruption, to be perpetually carried on.\n\nAmong the philosophers of Greece, such a power was almost universally admitted. It seems, indeed, to have been rejected only by the followers of Democritus and Epicurus, who talk as if they had thought gravity essential to matter, and the fortuitous motion of atoms, which they held to have been from eternity, the source not only of all the regular motions in the universe, but also of the organization of all corporeal systems, and even of sensation and intellective, in brutes and in men. It is needless to say, that those men, whatever they might profess, were in reality atheists; and Democritus, it is universally known, avowed his atheism.\n\nThe greater part of the philosophers who held the existence of a plastic nature, considered it not as an agent in the strict sense of the word, but merely as an instrument in the hand of the Deity; though even among them there were some who held no superior power, and were of course as gross atheists as Democritus himself. Such was Strato of Lampacus. This man was originally of the peripatetic school, over which he presided many years, with no small degree of reputation for learning and eloquence. He was the first and chief assertor of what has been termed Hylozoic atheism; a system which admits of no power superior to a certain natural or plastic life, essential, ingenerable, and incorruptible, inherent in matter, but without sense and consciousness. That such was his doctrine we learn from Cicero, who makes Velleius the Epicurean say, \"Nec audendus Strato qui Physicus appellatur, qui omnem vim divinam in Naturae fitam effe censet, quae causas gigantici, augendi, minuendi habeat, sed caret omni sensu.\" That Strato in admitting this plastic principle, differed widely from Democritus, is apparent from the following account of him by the same author: Strato Lampacenus negat opera deorum le uti ad fabricandum mundum, quaeunque sint docet omnia esse effecta naturae, nec ut illae, qui asperis, et levibus, et hamatis uncinateque corporibus concretae haec esse dicat, interjecta inani; somnia cenent haec esse Democriti, non docentis sed optantis.\n\nThat the rough and smooth, and hooked and crooked, atoms of Democritus, were indeed dreams and delusions, is a position which no man will controvert; but surely Strato was himself as great a dreamer when he made sensation and intelligence result from a certain plastic or spermatic life in matter, which is itself devoid of sense and consciousness. It is, indeed, inconceivable, to use the emphatic language of Cudworth, \"how any one in his senses should admit such a monstrous paradox as this, that every atom of dust has in itself as much wisdom as the greatest politician and most profound philosopher, and yet is neither conscious nor intelligent!\"\n\nIt is to be observed of Strato likewise, that though he attributed a certain kind of life to matter, he by no means allowed of one common life as ruling over the whole material universe. He supposed the several parts of matter to have so many several plastic lives of their own, and seems to have attributed something to chance in the production and preservation of the mundane system.\n\nIn denying the existence of a God, perpetually directing his plastic principle, and in supposing as many of these principles as there are atoms of matter, Strato deviated far from the doctrine of Aristotle. The great founder of the peripatetic school, as well as his apostate disciple, taught that mundane things are not effected by fortuitous mechanism, but by such a nature as acts regularly and artificially for ends; yet he never considers this nature as the highest principle, or supreme Numen, but as subordinate to a perfect mind or intellect; and he expressly affirms, that \"mind, together with nature, formed or fashioned this universe.\" He evidently considers mind as the principal and intelligent agent, and nature as the subservient and executive instrument. Indeed, we are strongly inclined to adopt the opinion of the learned Moehlheim, who thinks that by nature Aristotle meant nothing more than that \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, or animal heat, to which he attributes immortality, and of which he expressly says that all things are full. Be De Generatione Animalium lib. iii. cap. ii., this as it may, he always joins God and nature together, and affirms that they do nothing in vain. The same doctrine was taught before him by Plato, who affirms that \"nature, together with reason, and according to it, orders all things.\" It must not, however, be concealed, that Plato seems to have attributed intelligence to the principle by which he supposed the world to be animated; for Chalcidius, commenting on the Timaeus, thus expresses himself: \"Hec est illa ratione... Sect. 53. velles anima mundi, quae gemina juxta meliorem naturam veneratione tutelam praebet infernibus, divinis dispositionibus obsequens, providentiam nativis impertiens, eorum similitudine propter cognitionem beatam.\"\u2014Apologeticus, tells us, \"Ilam coelestem animam, fontem animarum omnium, optimam virtutem effe genetricem, subferviri etiam Fabricatoris Deo, et pretio effe ad omnium inventione ejus.\" Plato pronunciavit.\n\nThe doctrine of Plato has been adopted by many moderns of great eminence both for genius and for learning. The celebrated Berkeley bishop of Cloyne, after giving the view of Plato's anima mundi, which the reader will find in our article MOTION, No. 12, thus recommends the study of his philosophy: \"If that philosopher himself was not read only, but studied also with care, and made his own interpreter, I believe the prejudice that now lies against him would soon wear off, or be even converted into high esteem, for those excellent notions, and fine hints, that sparkle and shine throughout his writings; which seem to contain not only the most valuable learning of Athens and Greece, but also a treasure of the most remote traditions and early science of the east.\" Cudworth, and the learned author of Ancient Metaphysics, are likewise strenuous advocates for the Aristotelian doctrine of a plastic nature diffused through the material world; (see Metaphysics, No. 200, 201, 202.) and a notion very similar has lately occurred.\noccurred to a writer who does not appear to have borrowed it either from the Lyceum or the Academy.\n\nThis writer is Mr Young, of whose active fulgence, and its agency in moving bodies, some account has been given elsewhere, (see Motion). As a mere unconscious agent, immaterial, and, as he expresses himself, immental, it bears a striking resemblance to the phyletic nature or vegetable life of Cudworth; but the author holds it to be not only the principle of motion, but also the basis or fulcrum of matter itself; in the production of which, by certain motions, it may be said to be more strictly plastic than the hylarchical principle, or vis gentrix, of any other philosopher with whose writings we have any acquaintance. Though this opinion be singular, yet as its author is evidently a man who thinks for himself, unawed by the authority of celebrated names, and as one great part of the utility of such works as ours consists in their serving as indexes to science and literature, we shall lay before our readers a short abstract of the reasonings by which Mr Young endeavours to support his hypothesis, and we shall take the liberty of remarking upon those reasonings as we proceed.\n\nThe author, after a short introduction, enters upon his work, in a chapter intitled, Analysis of Matter in general. In that chapter there is little novelty. He treats, as others have done, of primary and secondary qualities, and adheres too closely to the language of Locke, when he says, that \"the nature of bodies signifies the aggregate of all those ideas with which they furnish us, and by which they are made known.\" To say the best of it, this sentence is inaccurately expressed. An aggregate of ideas may be occasioned by the impulse of bodies on the organs of sense, but the effect of impulse cannot be that which impels. We should not have made this remark, which may perhaps be deemed captious, were we not persuaded that the vague and inaccurate use of terms is the source of those mistakes into which, we cannot help thinking, that the very ingenious author has sometimes fallen. Having justly observed, that we know nothing directly of bodies but their qualities, he proceeds to investigate the nature of solidity.\n\n\"Solidity (he says) is the quality of body which principally requires our notice. It is that which fills extension, and which resists other solids, occupying the place which it occupies; thus making extension and figure real, and different from mere space and vacuity. If the fe-\n\n---\n\n(A) We can only conceive of solidity as being a resistance of the parts of any body, to a power which endeavours to separate them, or to bring them nearer together. Now that which resists any power, and prevents its effect, is also a power. By resistance, I mean here an active resistance, such as an animal can employ against an animal. If a horse pulls against a load, he draws it along; but if he draws against another horse, he is put to a stand, and his endeavor is defeated. When any endeavor to change the situation of the parts of any solid is in like manner prevented from taking effect, and the parts retain their situation, the situation has plainly been preserved by an active resistance or power, equivalent to that which was fruitlessly exerted on them.\"\n\nSuch is our author's reasoning to prove that matter is essentially active, and that from this activity results our notion of its solidity: but does he not here confound solidity with hardness, and impenetrability with cohesion? He certainly does; for water is as solid, in the proper sense of the word, as adamant, and the particles of air as the particles of iron. The parts of water are, indeed, separated with ease, and those of adamant with difficulty; but it is not because the latter have more solidity than the former, but because the power of cohesion, whatever it may be, operates upon them with greater force. Solidity is an attribute of a whole; hardness and softness result from the cohesion of parts. We do not at all perceive the propriety of the simile of the horse pulling a load, and afterwards pulling against another horse. Is it because both horses are active that one of them cannot prevail against the other, and because the load is inactive that either of them may drag along a mass of iron of half a ton weight?\nwhich we do not perceive the force, attempted to prove that it is by an inward power, and not by its inertia, that one body prevents another from occupying the same place with itself; he naturally enough infers matter to be essentially active. \"But the activity of matter is to be considered in a certain limited sense, and its inertness is to be regarded in another limited sense; so that these are compatible within their respective limits. The activity of body may be considered as belonging to the parts of a compound; its inertia as the inertia formed of those parts. The actions of the parts are everywhere opposed to each other, and equal; and hence results the inactivity of the whole.\"\n\nSolidity alone of the primary qualities being positive, and peculiar to bodies, and our author having resolved this into action or power, it follows, by his analysis, that the essence of body is reduced to power likewise. But, as he properly observes, power is an idea of reflection, not acquired by the senses, but suggested by thought. Hence our knowledge of real existence in body must be such as is suggested to us by our thoughts exercised about our sensations. \"We are capable of acting and producing changes in appearances; and this faculty, which we experience to exist in ourselves, we call power. We are conscious of the exertion of our own power; and therefore, when we see action or change happen without any exertion of ours, we refer this to other powers without us, and necessarily conclude the power to exist where the change begins or the action is exerted. This power, then, referred to bodies, must exist in them, or it can exist nowhere.\"\n\nIn two chapters, which might easily have been compressed into one not so long as the shortest of them, our author analyzes atoms or the primary particles of matter, and strenuously opposes their impenetrability. He allows that there are atoms of matter not divisible by any known force; but as these, however small, must be conceived as having extension, each of them must be composed of parts held together by the same power which binds together many atoms in the same body. This power, indeed, he acknowledges to operate much more forcibly when it cements the parts of a primary atom than when it makes many atoms cohere in one mass; but still it operates in the same manner: and as the ideal analysis may be carried on ad infinitum, the only positive idea which is suggested by atoms, or the parts of atoms, is the idea of a resisting power. That this power of resistance, which constitutes what is vulgarly called the solidity of bodies, may not be absolutely impenetrable, he attempts to prove, by showing that resistance does in fact take place in cases where impenetrability, and even solidity, are not supposed by any man.\n\n\"Let us endeavour (says he) to bring together two like poles of a magnet, and we shall experience a resistance to their approximation. Why, then, may not a piece of iron, which between our fingers resists their coming together, result by an efficacy perfectly similar, though more strongly exerted? If magnetism were to act upon our bodies as upon iron, we should feel it; or were magnets endowed with sensation, they would feel that which resists their nearer approach. The resisting extension between the two magnets is permeable to all the rays of light, and reflecting none is therefore unseen; but it is easy to conceive that the same power which resists the approach of the iron might resist and reflect some rays of light. We should then have a visible object interposed between the two magnets, as we have before supposed it might be a tangible one. It is likewise easy to conceive that which is tangible and visible so applied to our organs of tasting, of smelling, and of hearing, as to excite ideas of flavours, odours, and sounds. Thus we see that an action, in which no supposition of solidity or impenetrability is involved, may be conceived to assume all the qualities of matter, by only supposing a familiar effect extended in its operation.\"\n\nThis reasoning is exceedingly ingenious, though perhaps not original; but what is of more importance, it does not approach so near to demonstration as the author seems to imagine. If magnets operate by means of a fluid issuing from them (see Magnetism), those who hold the solidity or impenetrability of matter will maintain, that each atom of the magnetic fluid is solid and impenetrable. That we do not see nor feel these atoms, will be considered as no argument that they do not exist; for we do not see, nor in a close room feel, the atoms of the surrounding atmosphere; which yet Mr Young will acknowledge to have a real existence, and to be capable of operating upon our senses of hearing and smelling. Let us, however, suppose, that by this reasoning he has established the non-existence of every thing in the primary atoms of matter but active powers of resistance, and let us see how he conceives the actions of these powers to constitute what gives us the notion of inert and solid body; for that we have such a notion cannot be denied.\n\nTo act he allows to be an attribute, and justly observes, that we cannot conceive an attribute to exist without a substance. \"But (says he) we have traced all phenomena to action as to a generic idea, comprehending under it all forms of matter and motion as species of that genus. By this analysis, that complex idea we usually denominated matter, and considered as the substance or substratum to which motion appertained as an attribute, is found to change its character, and to be itself an attribute of a substance essentially active, of which one modification of motion produces matter and another generates motion.\" The action of this substance Mr Young determines to be motion, (see Motion, No. 16.) and he proceeds to inquire by what kind of motion it produces matter, or inert and resisting atoms.\n\n\"Whatever portion of the active substance is given to form an atom, the following things are necessary to be united in such portion of active substance: 1stly, It must in some respect continually move; for otherwise it would lose its nature, and cease to be active. 2ndly, It must also in some other respect be at rest, for otherwise it could not form an inactive atom. 3rdly, It must preserve unity within itself.\" The author's proof\n\nIf so, double or triple the mass, and a very strange phenomenon will be the result; for we shall have an active whole compounded of two or three inactive parts, even though those parts should not be in contact!\nproof of the first of these positions we have given elsewhere. The second he holds to be self-evident; and the third he thinks established by the following reasoning: \"Solidity is the result of those actions among the parts of any whole, whereby the unity of the whole is preserved within itself. Several uncohering things may be united by an external bond: this does not constitute these one solid; it may be one bundle: but if several things cohere, and have a unity preserved within themselves, they become one solid. An atom is the least and most simple solid.\"\n\nHaving thus proved the necessity of these three requisites to the formation of an atom, he observes, that \"the two first can only be united in a rotation of the portion of active substance about a centre or axis at rest. By such a motion, all the parts successively occupy different places in the orbit of rotation, and therefore move; the centre round which they revolve being at rest, the whole portion is also at rest; and thus the portion is at once moving and quiescent, as is required. The same kind of motion will also fulfill the terms of the third requisite; for a substance having a revolving motion around its own centre, preserves its unity by reason of all the parts preserving the same relation to the centre: and further, a motion of the active substance about a centre or axis will be an activity in the same orbit, which will act upon and resist whatever shall interfere to oppose its activity, or destroy the unity of the sphere, by diverting the course of the revolving motions. The activity or motion of a portion of active substance about a centre will, therefore, give solidity to such portion; for it will give it unity and resistance, and in a manner tie together all the parts, forming them into one mass about their common centre: for they move or are active not towards the centre, in which case they would be lost in non-extension; nor from the centre, where they would dilate in boundless space; but about the centre, preserving the same limits of extension: and being in this way active, they in this way resist any other activity opposed to them, that is, they resist any action which tends to penetrate or divide this sphere of revolving activity. Therefore, since any portion of active substance does, by revolving about a centre, become an united, resisting, and quiescent whole, the smallest portions of the active substance which have such motions will become atoms, or make the smallest portions of matter.\"\n\nHaving thus shown to his own satisfaction how atoms of matter are formed, he next explains what at first he confesses may have appeared a paradox, \"how the active substance, retaining its own nature and essential properties, continuing immaterial, unfold, and active, puts on at the same time the form of matter, and becomes material, solid, and inert. A sphere of revolving active substance, as it revolves continually about a centre, and as parts of the substance, are considered as successively passing through every point in the orbit; considered thus in its parts, and in its motions, it is active substance, immaterial, and unfold; but the whole sphere, considered unitically, collectively, and as quiescent, is in this point of view a solid atom, material, and inert.\"\n\nSuch is the active substance of Mr Young, and such his theory of the formation of matter. That he has not with fertility copied from the ancients, every reader of his book, who is not an absolute stranger to Greek and Roman literature, will readily acknowledge; and yet if his theory be well founded, he has discovered a middle substance between mind and matter, more properly plastic than Aristotle or Plato, Cudworth or Berkeley, ever conceived. But truth compels us to add, that to us his theory appears to labour under infuperable objections. That there may be in the universe a substance essentially active, and at the same time not intelligent, is a proposition which we are by no means inclined to controvert. Various phenomena, both in vegetable and animal life, lead us to suspect that there is such a substance; but it does not follow that we are inclined to adopt our author's doctrine respecting the formation of matter. He conceives his proof, indeed, to be \"in its nature not at all imperfect, or to fall short of demonstration;\" and if any one refuse it, he thinks it will be necessary for him to show, either that the explanation offered is not sufficient, or that some other explanation will serve equally well.\"\n\nTo show that the explanation offered is not sufficient, will not, we apprehend, be a very arduous task; but we have no inclination to attempt ourselves another explanation, because we believe that of the formation of matter no other account can be given than that which resolves it into the fiat of the Creator. That it cannot be formed by the motion of an immaterial substance in the manner which our author has very clearly described, seems to be a truth so evident as not to admit of proof; for if motion be, as he defines it, a change of place, every thing that is moved must have the quality of extension. But all the parts of this active substance which are given to form an atom, move round a centre, and are expressly said to occupy successively different places in the orbit of rotation. Every one of these parts, therefore, is an extended being: and since, according to our author, solidity is nothing but an active power of repulsion, and the parts of this active substance, in their rotation round their centre, act upon and repel whatever interferes to oppose their activity, it follows that each of these parts is likewise a solid being. But, in the opinion of Mr Young himself, and of all mankind, whatever is extended and solid is material. This theory, therefore, exhibits a process in which atoms are formed of a substance, which, though it is said to be active, immaterial, and unfold, appears, when narrowly inspected, to be nothing else than a collection of those very atoms of which the author pretends to explain the formation. Mr Young, who examines and very freely censures some of the doctrines of Newton and others, is too much a man of science to be offended at us for stating objections to a theory which is quite new, to a transformation which he himself acknowledges may to many \"appear not only problematical and difficult to conceive, but wholly impossible, and implying contradictions absolutely and forever irreconcilable.\" Whether this be a just character of it our readers must determine; but if we did not believe the author to be a man of ingenuity, we should not have introduced him or his work to their acquaintance.\n\nPlastic Art, the art of representing all sorts of figures by the means of moulds. This term is derived from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, which signifies the \"art of forming, modelling, or casting, in a mould.\" A mould in general is a body that is made hollow for that purpose. The artist makes use of it to form figures in bronze,\nbronze, lead, gold, silver, or any other metal or fusible substance. The mould is made of clay, stucco, or other composition, and is hollowed into the form of the figure that is to be produced; they then apply the jet, which is a sort of funnel, through which the metal is poured that is to form the figures, and that is called running the metal into the mould.\n\nIt is in this manner, but with much practice and attention, that the artist forms, 1. Equestrian and pedetrian statues of every kind; 2. Groups; 3. Pedestals; 4. Bas-reliefs; 5. Medallions; 6. Cannons, mortars, and other pieces of artillery; 7. Ornaments of architecture, as capitals, bases, &c.; 8. Various sorts of furniture, as lutes, branches, &c., in every kind of metal; and in the same manner figures are cast in stucco, plaster, or any other fusible matter. See PLASTER OF PARIS.\n\nWax being a substance that is very easily put in fusion, plasters make much use of it. There are impressions which are highly pleasing in coloured wax, of medallions, bas-relief alto relievo, and of detached figures; which, however, are somewhat brittle. But this matter has been carried too far: they have not only formed moulds to represent the likeness and the bust of a living person, by applying the plaster to the face itself, and afterwards casting melted wax into the mould; but they have also painted that waxen bust with the natural colours of the face, and have then applied glass eyes and natural hair; to which they have joined a stuffed body and limbs, with hands of wax; and have, lastly, dressed their figure in a real habit; and by these means have produced an object the most shocking and detestable that it is possible to conceive. It is not a statue, a bust, a natural resemblance that they form; but a dead body, a lifeless countenance, a mere carcass. The stiff air, the inflexible muscles, the haggard eyes of glass, all contribute to produce an object that is hideous and disagreeable to every man of taste. Figures like these offend by affording too exact an imitation of nature. In no one of the polite arts ought imitation ever to approach so near the truth as to be taken for nature herself. Illusion must have its bounds; without which it becomes ridiculous.\n\nThere is another invention far more ingenious and pleasing, which is that wherein M. Lippart, antiquary and artist at Dresden, has so much excelled. He has found the means of resembling, by indefatigable labour, great expense, and infinite taste, that immense number of stones, engraved and cameo, which are to be seen in the most celebrated cabinets. He has made choice of those that are the most beautiful; and, with a plaster of his own invention, he takes from these stones an impression that is surprisingly accurate, and which afterwards become as marble: these impressions he calls pastes. He then gives them a proper colour, and incloses each with a gold rim; and, by ranging them in a judicious order, forms them an admirable system. They are fixed on pasteboards, which form so many drawers, and are then inclosed in cases, which represent folio volumes, and have titles wrote on their backs; so that these fictitious books may conveniently occupy a place in a library. Nothing can be more ingenious than this invention; and, by means of it, persons of moderate fortune are enabled to make a complete collection of all antiquity has left that is excellent of this kind; and the copies are very little inferior to the originals.\n\nThere is also another method of taking the impressions of cameos, medals, and coins, which is as follows: They wash or properly clean the piece whose impression is to be taken, and surround it with a border of wax. They then dissolve sealing-wax in water, and make a decoction of it, mixing with it some vermilion, to give it an agreeable red colour. They pour this paste, when hot, on the stone or medal, to the thickness of about the tenth part of an inch; they then leave it exposed to the sun, in a place free from dust. After a few days this paste becomes hard, and offers to the eye the most admirable and faithful representation of the medal that it is possible to conceive: they are then carefully placed in drawers; and thousands of these impressions, which comprehend many ages, may be included in a small compass.\n\nThe proficient in plasters have likewise invented the art of casting in a mould papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 or dissolved paper, and forming it into figures in imitation of sculpture, of ornaments and decorations for ceilings, furniture, &c., and which they afterwards paint or gild. There are, however, some inconveniences attending this art; as, for example, the imperfections in the moulds, which render the contours of the figures inelegant, and give them a heavy air: these ornaments, moreover, are not so durable as those of bronze or wood, seeing that in a few years they are preyed on by the worm.\n\nThe figures that are given to porcelain, Delft ware, &c., belong also to plasters; for they are formed by moulds, as well as by the art of the sculptor and turner; and by all these arts united are made vases of every kind, figures, groups, and other designs, either for use or ornament.\n\nFrom this general article the reader is referred to FOUNDRY, CAST, GLAZING, PORCELAIN, PAPIER-M\u00c2CH\u00c9, POTTERY, DELFT WARE.","sp":245,"ep":249},{"h":"PLATA","t":"the name of a very great river of South America, running through the province of Paraguay; whence the whole country is sometimes called Plata; though this name is usually bestowed only upon a part of Paraguay. In the latter sense it comprehends all that country bounded on the east and south-east by the Atlantic ocean; on the south, by Terra Magellonica; on the west, by Tucuman; and on the north, by the provinces of Paraguay Proper and Parana. The great river La Plata, from which the country has its name, was first discovered, in 1515, by Juan Diaz de Solis; but denominated La Plata by Sebastian Caboto, from the great quantity of the precious metals he procured from the adjacent inhabitants, imagining it was the produce of the country, though in fact they brought it from Peru.\n\nThe country lies between 32\u00b0 and 37\u00b0 of south latitude. The climate is pleasant and healthy. Their winter is in May, June, and July, when the nights are indeed very cold, but the days moderately warm; the frost is neither violent nor lasting, and the snows are very inconsiderable.\n\nThe country consists mostly of plains of vast extent, and exceeding rich soil, producing all sorts of European and American fruits, wheat, maize, cotton, sugar, honey, &c., and abounding with such excellent pastures, that the herds brought hither from Spain are multiplied to such a degree, that they are all in common, no man claiming any property in them, but every\nman takes what he hath occasion for. The number of black cattle, especially, is so prodigious, that many thousands of them are killed merely for their hides, every time the ships go for Spain, and their carcases left to be devoured by wild beasts and birds of prey, which are also very numerous. Sometimes, when they cannot vend their hides, they will kill them for their tongues; and those who care not to be at the trouble to fetch them from the plains, may buy them for a trifle. There is a curious account in Lord Anson's voyage of the manner of hunting them on horseback; and of catching and killing them, by throwing a noose on their horns at full gallop, the horses being trained to the sport. Horses are also numerous, and in common like the other cattle; so that a man may have as many as he pleases for the catching; and of those that are already broke, one may buy some of the best, and of the true Spanish breed, for a piece-of-eight per head. Wild fowl also is in great plenty here; partridges in particular are more numerous, and as large and tame as our hens, so that one may kill them with a stick. Their wheat makes the finest and whitest of bread; and, in a word, they seem to want for nothing here, especially the natives, but salt and fuel. The former the Spaniards have brought to them from other parts; and the latter they supply themselves with, by planting vast numbers of almond, peach, and other trees, which require no other trouble than putting the kernels into the ground, and by the next year, we are told, they begin to bear fruit. The return for European commodities is so great here, that it almost exceeds belief; an ordinary two-penny knife fetching a crown, and a gun of the value of 10 or 12 shillings 20 or 30 crowns, and so of the rest.\n\nThe river Plata rises in Peru, and receives a great many others in its course; the chief of which is the Paraguay. The water of it is said to be very clear and sweet, and to petrify wood; and contains such plenty and variety of fish, that the people catch great quantities of them without any other instrument than their hands. It runs mostly to the south and south-east; and is navigable the greater part of its course by the largest vessels, and full of delightful islands. All along its banks are seen the most beautiful birds of all kinds; but it sometimes overflows the adjacent country to a great extent, and is infested by serpents of a prodigious size. From its junction with the Paraguay to its mouth it is above 200 leagues. We may form some judgement of its largeness by the width of its mouth, which is said to be about 70 leagues. Before it falls into the Paraguay it is called Panama.

It is likewise used by sportsmen to express the reward given to the best horse at our races.\n\nThe winning a plate is not the work of a few days to the owner of the horse; but great care and preparation is to be made for it, if there is any great dependence on the success. A month is the least time that can be allowed to draw the horse's body clear, and to refine his wind to that degree of perfection that is attainable by art.\n\nIt is first necessary to take an exact view of his body, whether he be low or high in flesh; and it is also necessary to consider whether he be dull and heavy, or brisk and lively when abroad. If he appear dull and heavy, and there is reason to suppose it is owing to too hard riding, or, as the jockeys express it, to some gout that has been dissolved in hunting, and has not been removed by scouring, then the proper remedy is half an ounce of diapente given in a pint of good sack; this will at once remove the canic, and revive the creature's spirits. After this, for the first week of the month, he is to be fed with oats, bread, and split beans; giving him sometimes the one and sometimes the other as he likes best; and always leaving some in the locker, that he may feed at leisure when he is left alone. When the groom returns at the feeding-time, whatever is left of this must be removed, and fresh given; by this means the creature will soon become high-spirited, wanton, and full of play. Every day he must be rode out an airing, and every other day it will be proper to give him a little more exercise; but not so much as to make him sweat too much. The beans and oats in this case are to be put into a bag, and beaten till the hulls are all off, and then winnowed clean; and the bread, instead of being chipped in the common way, is to have the crust clean cut off. If the horse be in good flesh and spirits when taken up for its month's preparation, the diapente must be omitted; and the chief business will be to give him good food, and to much exercise as will keep him in wind, without overwearing him or tiring his spirits. When he takes larger exercises afterwards, towards the end of the month, it will be proper to have some horses in the place to run against him. This will put him upon his mettle, and the beating them will give him spirits. This, however, is to be cautiously observed, that he has not a bloody heat given him for ten days or a fortnight before the plate is to be run for; and that the last heat that is given him the day before the race, must be in his clothes: this will make him run with greatly more vigour, when stripped for the race, and feeling the cold wind on every part.\n\nIn the second week, the horse should have the same food,\nPLATING is the art of covering baser metals with a thin plate of silver either for use or for ornament. It is said to have been invented by a spur-maker, not for show but for real utility. Till then the more elegant spurs in common use were made of solid silver, and from the flexibility of that metal they were liable to be bent into inconvenient forms by the slightest accident. To remedy this defect, a workman at Birmingham contrived to make the branches of a pair of spurs hollow, and to fill that hollow with a slender rod of steel or iron. Finding this a great improvement, and being desirous to add cheapness to utility, he continued to make the hollow larger, and of course the iron thicker and thicker, till at last he discovered the means of coating an iron spur with silver in such a manner as to make it equally elegant with those which were made wholly of that metal. The invention was quickly applied to other purposes; and to numberless utensils which were formerly made of brass or iron are now given the strength of these metals, and the elegance of silver, for a small additional expense.","sp":250,"ep":251},{"h":"PLATEBAND","t":"in Gardening, a border or bed of flowers, along a wall, or the side of a parterre, frequently edged with box, &c.\n\nPLATEBAND of a door or window, is used for the lintel, where that is made square, or not much marked.","sp":250,"ep":250},{"h":"PLATO","t":"an illustrious philosopher of antiquity, was by descent an Athenian, though the place of his birth was the island of Egina. His lineage through his father is traced back to Codrus the last king of Athens, and through his mother to Solon the celebrated legislator. The time of his birth is commonly placed in the beginning of the 88th Olympiad; but Dr Enfield thinks it may be more accurately fixed in the third year of the 87th Olympiad, or 432 years before the Christian era. He gave early indications of an extensive and original genius, and had an education suitable to his high rank, being instructed in the rudiments of letters by the grammarian Dionysius, and trained in athletic exercises by Aristo of Argos. He applied with great diligence to the study of the arts of painting and poetry; and made such proficiency in the latter, as to produce an epic poem, which, upon comparing it with the poems of Homer, he committed to the flames. At the age of 20 he composed a dramatic piece; but after he had given it to the performers, happening to attend upon a discourse of Socrates, he was so captivated by his eloquence, that he reclaimed his tragedy without suffering it to be acted, renounced the muses, burnt all his poems, and applied himself wholly to the study of wisdom.\n\nIt is thought that Plato's first matters in philosophy were Cratylus and Hermogenes, who taught the systems of Heraclitus and Parmenides; but when he was 20 years old, he attached himself wholly to Socrates, with whom he remained eight years in the relation of a scholar. During this period, he frequently displeased his companions, and sometimes even his master, by grafting upon the Socratic system opinions which were taken from some other stock. It was the practice of the scholars of Socrates to commit to writing the substance of their master's discourses. Plato wrote them in the form of dialogues; but with so great additions of his own, that Socrates, hearing him recite his Lyfs, cried out, \"O Hercules! how many things does this young man feign of me!\"\n\nPlato, however, retained the warmest attachment to his master. When that great and good man was summoned before the senate, his illustrious scholar undertook to plead his cause, and begun a speech in his defense; but the partiality and violence of the judges would not permit him to proceed. After the condemnation, he presented his master with money sufficient to redeem his life; which, however, Socrates refused to accept. During his imprisonment, Plato attended him, and was present at a conversation which he held with his friends concerning the immortality of the soul; the substance of which he afterwards committed to writing in the beautiful dialogue intitled Phaedo, not, however, without interweaving his own opinions and language.\n\nThe philosophers who were at Athens were so alarmed at the death of Socrates, that most of them fled from the city to avoid the injustice and cruelty of the government. Plato, whose grief upon this occasion is said by Plutarch to have been excessive, retired to Megara; where he was kindly entertained by Euclid, who had been one of Socrates's first scholars, till the storm was over. Afterwards he determined to travel in pursuit of knowledge; and from Megara he went to Italy, where he conferred with Eurytus, Philolaus, and Archytas. These were the most celebrated of the followers of Pythagoras, whose doctrine was then become famous in Greece; and from these the Pythagoreans have affirmed that he had all his natural philosophy. He dived into the most profound and mysterious secrets of the Pythagorean doctrines; and perceiving other knowledge to be connected with them, he went to Cyrene, where he learned geometry of Theodorus the mathematician. From thence he passed into Egypt, to acquaint himself with the theology of their priests, to study more nicely the proportions of geometry, and to instruct himself in astronomical observations; and having taken a full survey of all the country, he settled for some time in the province of Sais, learning of the wise men there, what they held concerning the universe, whether it had a beginning, whether it moved wholly or in part, &c.; and Paulinus affirms, that he learned from these the immortality, and also the transmigration, of souls. Some of the fathers will have it, that he had communication with the books of Moses, and that he studied under a learned Jew of Heliopolis; but there is nothing that can be called evidence for these assertions. St Austin once believed that Plato had some conference with Jeremiah; but afterwards discovered, that that prophet must have been dead at least 60 years before Plato's voyage to Egypt.\n\nPlato's curiosity was not yet satisfied. He travelled into Persia to consult the magi about the religion of that country; and he designed to have penetrated even to the Indies, and to have learned of the Brachmans their manners and customs; but the wars in Asia prevented him.\n\n\"He then returned into Italy, to the Pythagorean school at Tarentum, where he endeavoured to improve his own system, by incorporating with it the doctrine of Pythagoras, as it was then taught by Archytas, Timaeus, and others. And afterwards, when he visited Sicily, he retained such an attachment to the Italic school, that, through the bounty of Dionysius, he purchased at a vast price several books which contained the doctrine of Pythagoras, from Philolaus, one of his followers.\n\n\"Returning home richly stored with knowledge of various kinds, Plato settled in Athens, and executed the design, which he had doubtless long had in contemplation, of forming a new school for the instruction of youth in the principles of philosophy. The place which he made choice of for this purpose was a public grove, called the Academy, from Hecadmus, who left it to the citizens for the purpose of gymnastic exercises. Adorned with statues, temples, and sepulchres, planted with lofty plane-trees, and intersected by a gentle stream, it afforded a delightful retreat for philosophy and the muses. Of this retreat Horace speaks:\n\nAtque\nAtque inter sylvas Academi quaere vereum.\n\n\"Midst Academic groves to search for truth.\"\n\nWithin this inclosure he possessed, as a part of his humble patrimony, purchased at the price of three thousand drachmas, a small garden, in which he opened a school for the reception of those who might be inclined to attend his instructions. How much Plato valued mathematical studies, and how necessary a preparation he thought them for higher speculations, appears from the inscription which he placed over the door of his school: \"Oubis ayos ergon houta.\" \"Let no one who is unacquainted with geometry enter here.\"\n\nThis new school soon became famous, and its master was ranked among the most eminent philosophers. His travels into distant countries, where learning and wisdom flourished, gave him celebrity among his brethren of the Socratic sect. None of these had ventured to institute a school in Athens except Aristippus; and he had confined his instructions almost entirely to ethical subjects, and had brought himself into some discredit by the freedom of his manners. Plato alone remained to inherit the patrimony of public esteem which Socrates had left his disciples; and he possessed talents and learning adequate to his design of extending the study of philosophy beyond the limits within which it had been inclosed by his master. The consequence was, not only that young men crowded to his school from every quarter, but that people of the first distinction in every department frequented the academy. Even females, disguised in men's clothes, often attended his lectures. Among the illustrious names which appear in the catalogue of his followers are Dion the Syracusan prince, and the orators Hyperides, Lyscursus, Demosthenes, and Ilocrates.\n\nGreatness was never yet exempted from envy. The disingenuous reputation of Plato brought upon him the hatred of his former companions in the school of Socrates, and they loaded him with detraction and obloquy. It can only be ascribed to mutual jealousy, that Xenophon and he, though they relate the discourses of their common master, studiously avoid mentioning one another. Diogenes the Cynic ridiculed Plato's doctrine of ideas and other abstract speculations. In the midst of these private censures, however, the public fame of Plato daily increased; and several states, among which were the Arcadians and the Thessians, sent ambassadors with earnest requests that he would come over, not only to instruct the young men in philosophy, but also to prescribe them laws of government. The Cyrenaics, Syracusans, Cretans, and Eleans, sent also to him: he did not go to any of them, but gave laws and rules of governing to all. He lived frugally, yet soberly and chastely. He was a man of great virtues, and exceedingly affable; of which we need no greater proof, than his civil manner of conversing with the philosophers of his own times, when pride and envy were at their height. His behaviour to Diogenes is always mentioned in his history. The Cynic was vastly offended, it seems, at the politeness and fine taste of Plato, and used to catch all opportunities of snarling at him. He dined one day at his table with other company, and, trampling upon the tapestry with his dirty feet, uttered this brutish sarcasm, \"I trample upon the pride of Plato;\" to which Plato wisely replied, \"With greater pride.\"\n\nThe fame of Plato drew disciples to him from all parts; among whom were Speusippus an Athenian, his sister's son, whom he appointed his successor in the academy, and the great Aristotle.\n\nThe admiration of this illustrious man was not confined to the breasts of a few philosophers. He was in high esteem with several princes, particularly Archelaus king of Macedon, and Dionysius tyrant of Sicily. At three different periods he visited the court of this latter prince, and made several bold but unsuccessful attempts to subdue his haughty and tyrannical spirit. A brief relation of the particulars of these visits to Sicily may serve to cast some light upon the character of our philosopher; and we shall give it in the words of Dr Enfield, from whose elegant history of philosophy we have extracted by much the most valuable parts of this article.\n\nThe professed object of Plato's first visit to Sicily, which happened in the 40th year of his age, during the reign of the elder Dionysius the son of Hermocrates, was, to take a survey of the island, and particularly to observe the wonders of Mount Aetna. Whilst he was resident at Syracuse, he was employed in the instruction of Dion, the king's brother-in-law, who possessed excellent abilities, though hitherto restrained by the terrors of a tyrannical government, and relaxed by the luxuries of a licentious court. Disgusted by the debauched manners of the Syracusans, he endeavoured to rescue his pupil from the general depravity. Nor did Dion disappoint his preceptor's expectations. No sooner had he received a taste of that philosophy which leads to virtue, than he was fired with an ardent love of wisdom. Entertaining an hope that philosophy might produce the same effect upon Dionysius, he took great pains to procure an interview between Plato and the tyrant. In the course of the conference, whilst Plato was discoursing on the security and happiness of virtue, and the miseries attending injustice and oppression, Dionysius, perceiving that the philosopher's discourse was levelled against the vices and cruelties of his reign, dismissed him with high displeasure from his presence, and conceived a design against his life. It was not without great difficulty that Plato, by the assistance of Dion, made his escape. A vessel which had brought over Pollis, a delegate from Sparta, was fortunately at that time returning to Greece. Dion engaged Pollis to take the charge of the philosopher, and land him safely in his native country; but Dionysius discovered the design, and obtained a promise from Pollis, that he would either put him to death or sell him as a slave upon the passage. Pollis accordingly sold him in the island of Aegina; the inhabitants of which were then at war with the Athenians. Plato could not long remain unnoticed: Anicerris, a Cyrenaic philosopher, who happened to be at that time in the island, discovered the stranger, and thought himself happy in an opportunity of showing his respect for so illustrious a philosopher: he purchased his freedom for 30 minae, or 84l. 10s. sterling money, and sent him home to Athens. Repayment being afterwards offered to Anicerris by Plato's relations, he refused the money, saying, with that generous spirit which true philosophy always inspires, that he saw no reason why the relations of Plato should engross to themselves the honour of serving him.\n\nAfter a short interval, Dionysius repented of his ill-\nplaced resentment, and wrote to Plato, earnestly requesting him to repair his credit by returning to Syracuse; to which Plato gave this high-minded answer, that philosophy would not allow him leisure to think of Dionysius. He was, however, prevailed upon by his friend Dion to accept of the tyrant's invitation to return to Syracuse, and take upon him the education of Dionysius the younger, who was heir apparent to the monarchy. He was received by Dionysius the reigning sovereign with every possible appearance of respect; but after feeling his friend banished, and being himself kept as a prisoner at large in the palace, he was by the tyrant sent back into his own country, with a promise that both he and Dion should be recalled at the end of the war in which the Sicilians were then engaged. This promise was not fulfilled. The tyrant wished for the return of Plato; but could not resolve to recall Dion. At last, however, having probably promised that the philosopher should meet his friend at the court of Syracuse, he prevailed upon Plato to visit that capital a third time. When he arrived, the king met him in a magnificent chariot, and conducted him to his palace. The Sicilians too rejoiced in his return; for they hoped that the wisdom of Plato would at length triumph over the tyrannical spirit of the prince. Dionysius seemed wholly divested of his former resentments, listened with apparent pleasure to the philosopher's doctrine, and, among other expressions of regard, presented him with eighty talents of gold. In the midst of a numerous train of philosophers, Plato now possessed the chief influence and authority in the court of Syracuse. Whilst Aristippus was enjoying himself in splendid luxury; whilst Diogenes was freely indulging his acrimonious humour; and whilst Alcines was gratifying his thirst after riches;\u2014Plato supported the credit of philosophy with an air of dignity, which his friends regarded as an indication of superior wisdom, but which his enemies imputed to pride. After all, it was not in the power of Plato to prevail upon Dionysius to adopt his system of policy, or to recall Dion from his exile. Mutual distrust, after a short interval, arose between the tyrant and the philosopher; each suspected the other of evil designs, and each endeavoured to conceal his suspicion under the disguise of respect. Dionysius attempted to impede upon Plato by condescending attentions, and Plato to deceive Dionysius by an appearance of confidence. At length, the philosopher became so much dissatisfied with his situation, that he earnestly requested permission to return to Greece, which was at last granted him, and he was sent home loaded with rich presents. On his way to Athens, pausing through Elis during the celebration of the Olympic games, he was present at this general assembly of the Greeks, and engaged universal attention.\n\nFrom this narrative it appears, that if Plato visited the courts of princes, it was chiefly from the hope of seeing his ideal plan of a republic realized; and that his talents and attainments rather qualified him to shine in the academy than in the council or the senate.\n\nPlato, now restored to his country and his school, devoted himself to science, and spent the last years of a long life in the instruction of youth. Having enjoyed the advantage of an athletic constitution, and lived all his days temperately, he arrived at the 81st, or according to some writers the 90th, year of his age, and died, through the mere decay of nature, in the first year of the hundred and eighth Olympiad. He passed his whole life in a state of celibacy, and therefore left no natural heirs, but transferred his effects by will to his friend Adiamantus. The grove and garden, which had been the scene of his philosophical labours, at last afforded him a sepulchre. Statues and altars were erected to his memory; the day of his birth long continued to be celebrated as a festival by his followers; and his portrait is to this day preserved in gems; but the most lasting monuments of his genius are his writings, which have been transmitted, without material injury, to the present times.\n\nThe character of this philosopher has always been high. Besides the advantages of a noble birth, he had a large and comprehensive understanding, a vast fund of wit and good taste, great evenness and sweetness of temper, all cultivated and refined by education and travel; so that it is no wonder if he was honoured by his countrymen, esteemed by strangers, and adored by his scholars. The ancients thought more highly of Plato than of all their philosophers; they always called him the Divine Plato; and they seemed relieved that his deficient should be more than human. \"There are (says Apuleius) who assert Plato to have sprung from a more sublime conception; and that his mother Pericleone, who was a very beautiful woman, was impregnated by Apollo in the shape of a spectre.\" Plutarch, Suidas, and others, affirm this to have been the common report at Athens. When he was an infant, his father Aristo went to Hymettus, with his wife and child, to sacrifice to the mutes; and while they were buried in the divine rites, a swarm of bees came and distilled their honey upon his lips. This, says Tully, was considered as a prefigure of his future eloquence. Apuleius relates, that Socrates, the night before Plato was recommended to him, dreamed that a young swan flew from Cupid's altar in the academy, and settled in his lap; thence soared to heaven, and delighted the gods with its music; and when Aristo the next day presented Plato to him, \"Friends (says Socrates), this is the twin of Cupid's academy.\" The Greeks loved fables: they show however in the present case, what exceeding respect was paid to the memory of Plato. Tully perfectly adored him; tells us, how he was justly called by Panetius the divine, the most wise, the most sacred, the Homer of philosophers; entitled him to Atticus, Deus ille noster; thinks, that if Jupiter had spoken Greek, he would have spoken in Plato's language, and made him so implicitly his guide in wisdom and philosophy, as to declare, that he had rather err with Plato than be right with any one else. But, panegyric aside, Plato was certainly a very wonderful man, of a large and comprehensive mind, an imagination infinitely fertile, and of a most flowing and copious eloquence. Nevertheless, the strength and heat of fancy prevailing in his composition over judgement, he was too apt to soar beyond the limits of earthly things, to range in the imaginary regions of general and abstracted ideas; and on which account, though there is always a greatness and fullness in his manner, he did not philosophize so much according to truth and nature as Aristotle, though Cicero did not scruple to give him the preference.\n\nThe writings of Plato are all in the way of dialogue; where he seems to deliver nothing from himself, but every thing\nthing as the sentiments and opinions of others, of Socrates chiefly, of Timaeus, &c. He does not mention himself anywhere, except once in his Phaedo, and another time in his Apology for Socrates. His style, as Aristotle observed, is betwixt prose and verse; on which account, some have not scrupled to rank him with the poets. There is a better reason for doing than the elevation and grandeur of his style; his matter is often-times the offspring of imagination, instead of doctrines or truths deduced from nature. The first edition of Plato's works in Greek was put out by Aldus at Venice in 1513; but a Latin version of him by Marcellus Ficinus had been printed there in 1491. They were reprinted together at Lyons in 1588, and at Frankfort in 1602. The famous printer Henry Stephens, in 1578, gave a most beautiful and correct edition of Plato's works at Paris, with a new Latin version by Serranus, in three volumes folio; and this deservedly passes for the best edition of Plato; yet Serranus's edition is very exceptional, and in many respects, if not in all, inferior to that of Ficinus.","sp":252,"ep":255},{"h":"PLATONIC","t":"something that relates to Plato, his school-philosophy, opinions, or the like. Thus, platonic love denotes a pure spiritual affection, for which Plato was a great advocate, subsisting between the different sexes, abstracted from all carnal appetites, and regarding no other object but the mind and its beauties; or it is even a sincere disinterested friendship subsisting between persons of the same sex, abstracted from any selfish views, and regarding no other object than the person, if any such love or friendship has aught of a foundation in nature.\n\nPLATONIC Year, or the Great Year, is a period of time determined by the revolution of the equinoxes, or the space wherein the stars and constellations return to their former places in respect of the equinoxes. The platonic year, according to Tycho Brahe, is 25816, according to Ricciolus 25910, and according to Caffini 24800 years.\n\nThis period once accomplished, it was an opinion among the ancients that the world was to begin anew, and the same series of things to turn over again.","sp":255,"ep":255},{"h":"PLATONISM","t":"the philosophy of Plato, which was divided into three branches, theology, physics, and mathematics. Under theology were comprehended metaphysics and ethics, or that which in modern language is called moral philosophy. Plato wrote likewise on dialectics, but with such inferiority to his pupil Aristotle, that his works in that department of science are seldom mentioned.\n\nThe ancient philosophers always began their theological systems with some discussion on the nature of the gods, and the formation of the world; and it was a fundamental doctrine with them, that from nothing nothing can proceed. We are not to suppose that this general axiom implied nothing more than that for every effect there must be a cause; for this is a proposition which no man will controvert who understands the terms in which it is expressed; but the ancients believed that a proper creation is impossible even to omnipotence, and that to the production of anything a material is not less necessary than an efficient cause, (see Metaphysics, N\u00b0 264\u2014394.) That with respect to this important question, Plato agreed with his predecessors and contemporaries, appears evident to us from the whole tenor of his\n\nTimaeus. We agree with Dr Enfield* in thinking, that Platonism, in this dialogue, which comprehends his whole doctrine on the subject of the formation of the universe, matter is so manifestly spoken of as eternally co-existing with God, that this part of his doctrine could not have been mistaken by so many learned and able writers, had they not been seduced by the desire of establishing a coincidence of doctrine between the writings of Plato and Moses. It is certain that neither Cicero\u2020 nor Apuleius\u2021 nor Alcinous\u00a7 nor even the later commentator Lib. i. c. 6. Chalcidius, undertook their matter in any other sense than as admitting two primary and incorruptible principles, God and matter; to which we shall afterwards see reason to add a third, namely ideas. The passages quoted by those who maintain the contrary opinion are by no means sufficient for their purpose. Plato, it is true, in his Timaeus, calls God the parent of the universe, and in his Sophist speaks of him as \"forming animate and inanimate beings, which did not before exist;\" but these expressions do not necessarily imply that this offspring of Deity was produced from nothing, or that no prior matter existed from which these new beings were formed. Through the whole dialogue of the Timaeus, Plato supposes two eternal and independent causes of all things; one, that by which all things are made, which is God; the other, that from which all things are made, which is matter. He distinguishes between God, matter, and the universe, and supposes the architect of the world to have formed it out of a mass of pre-existent matter. Matter, according to Plato, is an eternal and infinite principle. His doctrine on this head is thus explained by Cicero ||. \"Matter, from which all things are produced and formed, is a substance without form or quality, but capable of receiving all forms, and undergoing every kind of change; in which, however, it never suffers annihilation, but merely a solution of its parts, which are in their nature infinitely divisible, and move in portions of space which are also infinitely divisible. When that principle which we call quality is moved, and acts upon matter, it undergoes an entire change, and those forms are produced, from which arises the diversified and coherent system of the universe.\" This doctrine Plato unfolds at large in his Timaeus, and particularly insists upon the notion, that matter has originally no form, but is capable of receiving any. He calls it the mother and receptacle of forms, by the union of which with matter the universe becomes perceptible to the senses; and maintains, that the visible world owes its forms to the energy of the divine intellectual nature.\n\nOur author is supported in drawing this inference by the testimony of Diogenes Laertius, who surely understood the language and dogmas of Plato better than the most accomplished modern scholar can pretend to do; yet a learned writer* has lately expressed great surprise that any one should consider matter as having been, in Plato's opinion, uncreated; and he boldly affirms, that Laertius, instead of affirming that spirit and matter were the principles of all things, ought to have said that God alone, in Plato's estimation, was their original.\u2014To prove this, he gives from the Timaeus a quotation, in which the founder of the academy declares that God framed heaven and earth, and the inferior deities; and that as he fashioned, so he pervades all nature. He observes, that Cicero denominates the god of\nPlatonism. Plato the maker, and the god of Aristotle only the governor, of the world. And, to satisfy those who may demand a particular proof of Plato's having taught a real creation, he affirms that his writings abound with declarations on the subject, of which the meaning cannot be misapprehended. \"With this purpose (says he) Plato denominates at one time the principles or substance of all things, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, the productions of the efficient Deity, and at others enters more particularly into the question. Thus, he observes, that many persons are ignorant of the nature and power of mind or intellect, 'as having existed at the beginning, antecedent to all bodies.' Of this mind, he observes, that it is without exception \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, of all things the most ancient; and he subjoins, in order to remove all doubt of his purpose, that it is also \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd, the cause or principle of motion.\"\n\nWith all possible respect for Dr Ogilvie, of whose piety and erudition we are thoroughly convinced, we must take the liberty to say, that to us the declarations of Plato on this subject appear much less precise and explicit than they appear to him; and that the inference which he would draw from the words of Cicero seems not to flow necessarily from the sense of those words. That Plato believed God to have framed the heaven and the earth, and to have fashioned all nature, is a position which, as far as we know, has never been controverted; but between framing or fashioning the chaos or \u03bd\u1fe6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03bd, and calling the universe into existence from non-entity, there is an infinite and an obvious difference.\n\nThe distinction made by Cicero between the God of Plato and the God of Aristotle is a just distinction, but it will not bear the superstructure which the learned doctor builds upon it. Aristotle maintained the eternity of the world in its present form. Plato certainly taught that the first matter was in time reduced from a chaotic state into form by the power of the Demiurgus; but we have seen nothing in his writings which explicitly declares his belief that the first matter was itself created.\n\nThe learned Cudworth, who wished, like Dr Ogilvie, to find a coincidence of doctrine between the theology of Plato and that of the Gospel, strained all his faculties to prove that his favourite philosopher taught a proper creation; but he laboured in vain. He gives a number of quotations in support of his position; of which we shall here insert only two upon which Dr Ogilvie seems to lay the greatest stress. Plato, says the author of the Intellectual System, calls the one God (\u03b1) \u1f41 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f45\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \u1f02\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fc7 \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u2014He that makes earth, and heaven, and the gods, and doth all things both in heaven, and hell, and under the earth. And, again, \"he by whole efficiency the things of the world (\u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u1fb3\u03bd \u03b5\u1f51\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7) were afterwards made when they were not before.\" Both Cudworth and Ogilvie think this last sentence an explicit declaration of Plato's belief in the creative power of God; but that they are mistaken has been evinced by Motheim with a force of argument which will admit of no reply. In that part of the Sophist from which the quotation is taken, Plato considers the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, of which he is treating, as belonging both to God and to man; and he defines it in general to be \"a certain power which is the cause that things may afterwards be which were not before.\" Cudworth wishes to confine this definition to the divine power; and adds from himself to the text which he quotes the following words, which are not in Plato, or FROM AN ANTECEDENT NON-EXISTENCE BROUGHT FORTH INTO BEING! That the incomparable author intended to deceive his reader, we are far from imagining: his zeal for Platonic had deceived himself. Plato's definition comprehends the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, as well of man as of God; and therefore cannot infer a creative power anywhere, unless the father of the academy was so very absurd as to suppose human artists the creators of those machines which they have invented and made! Motheim thinks that Cudworth was misled by too implicit a confidence in Ficinus; and it is not impossible that Dr Ogilvie may have been swayed by the authority, great indeed, of the author of the Intellectual System.\n\nThat intellect existed antecedent to all bodies is indeed a Platonic dogma, from which Dr Ogilvie, after Cudworth, wishes to infer that the doctrine of the creation was taught in the academy; but Dr Ogilvie knows, and no man knew better than Cudworth, that Plato, with every other Greek philosopher, distinguished between body and matter; and that though he held the priority of intellect to the former, it by no means follows that he believed it to have existed antecedent to the latter. That he believed mind, or rather soul (for he distinguishes between the two), to be the cause or principle of motion, cannot be denied; but we are not therefore authorized to conclude, that he likewise believed it to be the cause of the existence of matter. That he believed mind to be the most ancient of all things, taking the word things in the most absolute sense, cannot be true, since by Dr Ogilvie's own acknowledgement he held the existence and eternity of ideas, not to add that he believed \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f22 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u2014the first hypostasis in his trinity, to be superior to mind and prior to it, though not in time, yet in the order of nature. When therefore he calls mind the most ancient of all things, he must be supposed to mean only, that it is more ancient than all bodies and inferior souls. It is no reflection on the character of Plato that he could not, by the efforts of his own reason, acquire any notion of a proper creation; since we, who have the advantage of his writings, and of\n\n(A) Motheim affirms that this quotation is nowhere to be found in the writings of Plato. He therefore at first suspected that the learned author, in looking hastily over Plato's tenth book De Legibus, had transferred to God what is there said of the anima mundi, leading by its own motions every thing in the heaven, the earth, and the sea, and that he had added something of his own. He dropped that opinion, however, when he found Plato, in the tenth book of his Republic, declaring it to be as easy for God to produce the sun, moon, stars, and earth, &c. from himself, as it is for us to produce the image of ourselves, and whatever else we please, only by interposing a looking-glass. In all this power, however, there is nothing similar to that of creation.\nPlatonism writings infinitely more valuable, to instruct us, find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to conceive how any thing can begin to be. We believe the fact on the authority of revelation; but should certainly have never agitated such a question, had it not been stated to us by writers inspired with celestial wisdom.\n\nIn the Platonic cosmogony we cannot therefore doubt but that the eternity of the \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 was taken for granted. Whether it was an eternal and necessary emanation from an eternal mind, is not perhaps quite so evident, though our own opinion is, that it was believed to be self-existent. But be this as it may, which is not worth disputing, one thing is certain, that Plato did not believe it to have a single form or quality which it did not receive either from the Demiurge or the Physis\u2014the second or third person of this trinity. Except Aristotle, all the Greek philosophers, who were not materialists, held nearly the same opinions respecting the origin of the world; so that in examining their systems we shall be greatly misled if we understand the terms incorporeal and immaterial as at all synonymous. It was also a doctrine of Plato, that there is in matter a necessary but blind and refractory force; and that hence arises a propensity in matter to disorder and deformity, which is the cause of all the imperfection which appears in the works of God, and the origin of evil. On this subject Plato writes with wonderful obscurity: but, as far as we are able to trace his conceptions, he appears to have thought, that matter, from its nature, resists the will of the Supreme Artificer, so that he cannot perfectly execute his designs; and that this is the cause of the mixture of good and evil which is found in the material world.\n\nPlato, however, was no materialist. He taught, that there is an intelligent cause, which is the origin of all spiritual being, and the former of the material world. The nature of this great being he pronounced it difficult to discover, and when discovered, impossible to divulge. The existence of God he inferred from the marks of intelligence, which appear in the form and arrangement of bodies in the visible world: and from the unity of the material system he concluded, that the mind by which it was formed must be one. God, according to Plato, is the supreme intelligence, incorporeal, without beginning, end, or change, and capable of being perceived only by the mind. He certainly distinguished the Deity not only from body, and whatever has corporeal qualities, but from matter itself, from which all things are made. He also ascribed to him all those qualities which modern philosophers ascribe to immaterial substance: and conceived him to be in his nature simple, unencumbered in space, the author of all regulated motion, and, in fine, possessed of intelligence in the highest perfection.\n\nHis notions of God are indeed exceedingly refined, and such as it is difficult to suppose that he could ever have acquired but from some obscure remains of primeval tradition, gleaned perhaps from the priests of Egypt or from the philosophers of the East. In the Divine Nature he certainly believed that there are two, and probably that there are three, hypostases, whom he called Platonic, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f72\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f72\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2. The first he considered as self-existent, and elevated far above all mind and all knowledge; calling him, by way of eminence, the being, or the one. The only attribute which he acknowledged in this person was goodness; and therefore he frequently styles him \u1f41 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2\u2014the good, or essential goodness. The second he considered as mind, the wisdom or reason of the first, and the maker of the world; and therefore he styles him \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. The third he always speaks of as the soul of the world; and hence calls him \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, or \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5. He taught that the second is a necessary emanation from the first, and the third from the second, or perhaps from the first and second.\n\nSome have indeed pretended, that the Trinity, which is commonly called Platonic, was a fiction of the later Platonists, unknown to the founder of the school: but any person who shall take the trouble to study the writings of Plato, will find abundant evidence that he really affected a triad of divine hypostases, all concerned in the formation and government of the world. Thus in his tenth book of Laws, where he undertakes to prove the existence of a Deity in opposition to atheists, he ascends no higher in the demonstration than to the \u1f41 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 or mundane soul, which he held to be the immediate and proper cause of all the motion that is in the world. But in other parts of his writings he frequently affects, as superior to the self-moving principle, an immoveable \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 or intellect, which was properly the demiurge or framer of the world; and above this hypostasis one most simple and absolutely perfect being, who is considered in his Theology as \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 the original deity, in contradiction from the others, who are only \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9. These doctrines are to be gathered from his works at large, particularly from the Timaeus, Philotheus, Sophista and Euthyphro; but there is a passage in his second epistle to Dionysius, apparently written in answer to a letter, in which that monarch had required him to give a more explicit account than he had formerly done of the nature of God, in which the doctrine of a Trinity seems to be directly asserted. \"After having said that he meant to wrap up his meaning in such obscurity, as that an adept only should fully comprehend it, he adds expressions to the following import: 'The Lord of Nature is surrounded on all sides by his works: whatever is exists by his permission: he is the fountain and source of excellence: around the second person are placed things of the second order; and around the third those of the third degree (B).\" Of this obscure passage a very satisfactory explanation is given in Dr Ogilvie's Theology of Plato, to which the narrow limits prescribed to such articles as this compel us to refer the reader. We shall only say, that the account which we have given of the Platonic trinity is ably supported by the doctor.\n\nIn treating of the eternal emanation of the second and third hypostases from the first, the philosophers of the academy compare them to light and heat proceeding from the sun. Plato himself, as quoted by Dr Cudworth, illustrates his doctrine by the same comparison.\n\n(B). \"\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd, \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u1f10\u03be \u1f18\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9. \u1f18\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd. \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u1ff3. Oper. p. 1269.\"\nFor \"\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\" or the first hypostasis, is in the intellectual world the same (he says) to intellect and intelligibles that the sun is in the corporeal world to vision and visibles; for as the sun is not vision itself but the cause of vision, and as that light by which we see is not the sun but only a thing like the sun; so neither is the Supreme or Highest Good properly knowledge, but the cause of knowledge; nor is intellect, considered as such, the best and most perfect being, but only a being having the form of perfection.\" Again, \"as the sun causes other things not only to become visible but also to be generated; so the Supreme Good gives to things not only their capability of being known, but also their very essences by which they subsist; for this fountain of the Deity, this highest good, is not itself properly essence, but above essence, transcending it in respect both of dignity and of power.\"\n\nThe resemblance which this trinity of Plato bears to that revealed in the gospel must be observed by every attentive reader; but the two doctrines are likewise in some respects exceedingly dissimilar. The third hypostasis in the Platonic system appears in no point of view co-ordinate with the first or second. Indeed the first is elevated far above the second, and the third funk still farther beneath it, being considered as a mere soul immersed in matter, and forming with the corporeal world, to which it is united, one compound animal. Nay, it does not appear perfectly clear, that Plato considered his \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 as a pure spirit, or as having subsisted from eternity as a distinct Hypothesis. \"This governing spirit, of whom the earth, properly so called, is the body, consisted, according to our author's philosophy, of the same and the other; that is, of the first matter, and of pure intelligence, framed to actuate the machinery of nature. The Supreme Being placed him in the middle of the earth; which, in the vivid idea of Plato, seemed itself to live, in consequence of an influence that was felt in every part of it. From this seat his power is represented as being extended on all sides to the utmost limit of the heavens; conferring life, and preserving harmony in the various and complicated parts of the universe. Upon this being God is said to have looked with peculiar complacency after having formed him as an image of himself, and to have given beauty and perfect proportion to the mansion which he was destined to occupy. According to the doctrine of Timaeus, the Supreme Being struck out from this original mind innumerable spirits of inferior order, endowed with principles of reason; and he committed to divinities of secondary rank the task of investing these in material forms, and of dispersing them as inhabitants of the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies. He taught also, that at death the human soul is reunited to the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, as to the source from which it originally came.\"\n\nSuch is the third person of the Platonic triad, as we find his name and attributes very accurately stated by Dr Ogilvie; and the Christian philosopher, who has no particular system to support, will not require another proof that the triad of Plato differs exceedingly from the Trinity of the Scriptures. Indeed the third hypostasis in this triad has so much the appearance of all that the ancients could mean by that which we call a creature, that the learned Cudworth, who wished, it is difficult to conceive for what reason, to find the sublime mystery of the Christian faith explicitly taught in the writings of a pagan philosopher, was forced to suppose that Plato held a double \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2, or soul, one \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 incorporated with the material world, and the other \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 or supramundane, which is not the soul but the governor of the universe. We call this a mere hypothesis; for though the author displays vast erudition, and adduces many quotations in which this double \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 is plainly mentioned, yet all those quotations are taken from Platonists who lived after the propagation of the gospel, and who, calling themselves eclectics, freely stole from every sect such dogmas as they could incorporate with their own system, and then attributed those dogmas to their master. In the writings of Plato himself, there is not so much as an allusion to this supramundane \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2; and it is for this reason (the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2, of which he treats being so very inferior to the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff3) that we have expressed with hesitation his \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. Yet that he did admit so many, seems more than probable both from the passage illustrated by Dr Ogilvie, and from the attempt of Plotinus, one of his followers, to demonstrate that the number can be neither greater nor less. That his doctrine on this subject should be inaccurate and erroneous, can excite no wonder; whilst it must be confessed to have such a resemblance to the truth, and to be incapable of being proved by reasoning from effects to causes, that we could not doubt of his having inherited it by tradition, even though we had not complete evidence that something very similar to it was taught long before him, not only by Pythagoras and Parmenides, but by the philosophers of the east.\n\nWe have said that the Demiurgus was the maker of the world from the first matter which had existed from eternity; but in Plato's cosmogony there is another principle, more mysterious, if possible, than any thing which we have yet mentioned. This is his intellectual system of ideas, which it is not easy to collect from his writings, whether he considered as independent existences, or only as archetypal forms, which had subsisted from eternity in the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 or divine intellect. On this subject he writes with such exceeding obscurity, that men of the first eminence, both among the ancients and the moderns, have differed about his real meaning. Some have supposed, that by ideas he meant real beings subsisting from eternity, independent of all minds, and separate from all matter; and that of these ideas he conceived some to be living and others to be without life. In this manner his doctrine is interpreted by Tertullian among the ancients, and by the celebrated Brucker among the moderns; and not by them only, but by many others equally learned, candid, and acute. Cudworth, on the other hand, with his annotator Mosheim, contend, that by his ideal world Plato meant nothing more than that there existed from eternity in the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 or mind of God a notion or conception of every thing which was in time to be made. This is certainly much more probable in itself, than that a man of enlarged understanding should have supposed, that there are somewhere in extramundane space real living incorporeal beings eating and drinking, which are the ideas of all the animals which ever have been or ever will be eating and drinking in this world. Yet Mosheim candidly acknowledges, that if the controversy were to be decided by the votes of the learned, he is doubtful whether it would be given for or against him; and Cudworth, though he pleads\nPlatonism pleads the cause of his master with much ingenuity, owns, that on this subject his language cannot be vindicated. This indeed is most true; for Plato contends, that his ideas are not only the objects of science, but also the proper or physical causes of all things here below; that the idea of similitude is the cause of the resemblance between two globes; and the idea of dissimilitude the cause that a globe does not resemble a pyramid: he likewise calls them ovus, efences or fulfiances, and many of his followers have pronounced them to be animals.\n\nThese wonderful expressions incline us to adopt with some hesitation the opinion stated by Dr Enfield. This historian of philosophy having observed, that some of the admirers of Plato contend, that by ideas existing in the reason of God, nothing more is meant than conceptions formed in the Divine mind, controverts this opinion with much effect. \"By ideas, Plato (says he) appears to have meant something much more mysterious; namely, patterns or archetypes subsisting by themselves, as real beings, ovus ola in the Divine reason, as in their original and eternal region, and issuing thence to give form to sensible things, and to become objects of contemplation and science to rational beings. It is the doctrine of the Timaeus, that \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6, the reason of God, comprehends exemplars of all things, and that this reason is one of the primary causes of things. Plutarch says, that Plato supposes three principles, God, Matter, and Idea. Justin Martyr, Pseudo-Origen, and others, affirm the same thing.\n\n\"That this is the true Platonic doctrine of ideas will appear probable, if we attend to the manner in which Plato framed his system of opinions concerning the origin of things. Having been from his youth (says Aristotle) conversant with Cratylus, a disciple of Heraclitus, and instructed in the doctrine of that school, that all sensible things are variable, and cannot be proper objects of science, he reasonably concluded, that if there be any such thing as science, there must exist, besides sensible objects, certain permanent natures, perceptible only by the intellect.\" Such natures, divine in their origin, and eternal and immutable in their existence, he admitted into his system, and called them ideas. Visible things were regarded by Plato as fleeting shades, and ideas as the only permanent substances. These he conceived to be the proper objects of science to a mind raised by divine contemplation above the perpetually varying scenes of the material world.\"\n\nIt was a fundamental doctrine in the system of Plato, that the Deity formed the material world after a perfect model, consisting of those ideas which had eternally subsisted in his own reason; and yet, with some appearance of contradiction, he calls this model \"self-existent, indivisible, and eternally generated.\" Nay, he talks of it as being intelligent as well as eternal, and wholly different from the transcripts, which are subjected to our inspection. There is so much mystery, confusion, and apparent absurdity, in the whole of this system, as it has come down to us, that we must suppose the friends of Plato to have been entrusted with a key to his esoteric doctrines, which has long been lost, otherwise it would be difficult to conceive how that philosopher could have had so many admirers.\n\nWith almost every ancient theist of Greece the founder of the academy believed in an order of beings called daemons, which were superior to the souls of men, and Plato struck off by the Demiurge from the foul of the world.\n\nOf these the reader will find some account elsewhere: (See Daemon and Polytheism). We mention them at present because they make an important appearance in Plato's system of physics, which was built upon them and upon the doctrine which has been stated concerning God, matter, and ideas. He taught, that the visible world was formed by the Supreme Architect, uniting eternal and immutable ideas to the first matter; that the universe is one animated being *, including within its limits all animated natures; that, in the formation of the visible and tangible world, fire and earth were first formed, and were afterwards united by means of air and water; that from perfect parts one perfect whole was produced, of a spherical figure, as most beautiful in itself, and best fitted to contain all other figures \u2020; that the elementary parts of the world are of regular geometrical forms, the particles of earth being cubical, those of fire pyramidal, those of air in the form of an octahedron, and those of water in that of an icosahedron; that these are adjusted in number, measure, and power, in perfect conformity to the geometrical laws of proportion; that the soul which pervades this sphere is the cause of its revolution round its centre; and, lastly, that the world will remain for ever, but that by the action of its animating principle, it accomplishes certain periods, within which every thing returns to its ancient place and state. This periodical revolution of nature is called the Platonic or great year. See the preceding article.\n\nThe metaphysical doctrines of Plato, which treat of the human soul, and the principles of his system of ethics, have been detailed in other articles (See Metaphysics, Part III. chap. iv.; and Moral Philosophy, No. 6.); but it is worthy of observation in this place, that, preparatory to the study of all philosophy, he required from his disciples a knowledge of the elements of mathematics. In his Republic, he makes Glaucus, one of the speakers, recommend them for their usefulness in human life. \"Arithmetic for accounts and distributions; geometry for encampments and mensurations; music for solemn festivals in honour of the gods; and astronomy for agriculture, for navigation, and the like. Socrates, on his part, denies not the truth of all this, but still intimates that they were capable of answering an end more sublime. \"You are pleasant (says he) in your seeming to fear the multitude, lest you should be thought to enjoin certain sciences that are useless. 'Tis indeed no contemptible matter, though a difficult one, to believe, that through these particular sciences the soul has an organ purified and enlightened, which is destroyed and blinded by studies of other kinds; an organ better worth saving than a thousand eyes, in as much as truth becomes visible through this alone.\"\n\nConcerning policy, Plato has written at large in his Republic and in his Dialogue on Laws. He was so much enamoured with his own conceptions on this subject, that it was chiefly the hope of having an opportunity to realise his plan of a republic which induced him to visit the court of Dionysius. But they who are conversant with mankind, and capable of calmly investigating the springs of human actions, will easily perceive that his projects were chimerical, and could only have originated in a mind replete with philosophical enthusiasm. Of this nothing can be a clearer proof than the design of admitting:\nPlatonism ting in his republic a community of women, in order to give reason an entire control over desire. The main object of his political institutions appears to have been, the subjugation of the passions and appetites, by means of the abstract contemplation of ideas. A system of policy, raised upon such fanciful grounds, cannot merit a more distinct consideration.\n\nSuch is genuine Platonism as it was taught in the old academy by the founder of the school and his immediate followers; but when Arcesilaus was placed at the head of the academics, great innovations were introduced both into their doctrines and into their mode of teaching (see Arcesilaus). This man was therefore considered as the founder of what was afterwards called the middle academy. Being a professed sceptic, he carried his maxim of uncertainty to such a height, as to alarm the general body of philosophers, offend the governors of the state, and bring just odium upon the very name of the academy. At length Carneades, one of the disciples of this school, relinquishing some of the more obnoxious tenets of Arcesilaus, founded what has been called the new academy with very little improvement on the principles of the middle. See Carneades.\n\nUnder one or other of these forms Platonism found its way into the Roman republic. Cicero was a Platonist, and one of the greatest ornaments of the school. A school of Platonists was likewise founded in Alexandria in the second century of the Christian era; but their doctrines differed in many particulars from those taught in the three academies. They professed to seek truth wherever they could find it, and to collect their dogmas from every school. They endeavoured to bend some of the principles of Plato into a conformity with the doctrines of the gospel; and they incorporated with the whole many of the maxims of Aristotle and Zeno, and not a few of the fictions of the east. Their system was therefore extremely heterogeneous, and seldom so rational as that of the philosopher after whose name they were called, and of whose doctrines we have given so copious a detail. See Ammonius, Eclectics, and Plotinus.","sp":255,"ep":260},{"h":"PLAUTUS","t":"Marcus Accius, a comic writer of ancient Rome, born in Umbria, a province of Italy. His proper name was Marcus Accius, and he is supposed to have acquired the surname of Plautus from having play feet. His parentage appears to have been mean; so that some have thought he was the son of a slave. Aulus Gellius says that Plautus was distinguished for his poetry on the theatre, and Cato for his eloquence in the forum, at the same time; and observes elsewhere from Varro, that he was so well paid for his plays as to double his stock in trading, in which he lost all he gained by the mules. He is said to have been reduced to work at a mill for his subsistence; but Varro adds, that his wit was his best support, as he composed three of his plays during this drudgery. He died in the first year of the elder Cato's censorship, about the year of Rome 369, and 184 before Christ. We have 20 of his plays extant, though not all of them entire. Five of them, comedies, have been elegantly translated into English by Mr B. Thornton, and published in 2 vols 8vo, 1767.\n\nPLAYS. See the following article.\n\nPLAYHOUSE. See Theatre, Amphitheatre, &c. The most ancient English playhouses were the Curtain in Shoreditch and the Theatre. In the time of Playhouse, Shakespeare, who commenced a dramatic writer in 1592, there were no less than 10 theatres open. Four of these were private houses, viz. that in Blackfriars, the Cockpit or Phoenix in Drury-Lane, a theatre in Whitefriars, and one in Salisbury court. The other six were called public theatres, viz. the Globe, the Swan, the Rose, and the Hope, on the Bank-side; the Red Bull, at the upper end of St John's street, and the Fortune in White-cross street. The two last were chiefly frequented by citizens. Mr Malone gives us a pretty copious account of these playhouses, in a supplement to his last edition of Shakespeare, which we shall here insert.\n\n\"Most, if not all (says he) of Shakespeare's plays were performed either at the Globe or at the Theatre in Blackfriars. It appears that they both belonged to the same company of comedians, viz. his majesty's servants, which title they assumed, after a licence had been granted to them by King James in 1603, having before that time been called the servants of the lord chamberlain.\n\n\"The theatre in Blackfriars was a private house; but the peculiar and distinguishing marks of a private playhouse it is not easy to ascertain. It was very small, and plays were there usually represented by candle light. The Globe, situated on the southern side of the river Thames, was a hexagonal building, partly open to the weather, partly covered with reeds. It was a public theatre, and of considerable size, and there they always acted by daylight. On the roof of the Globe, and the other public theatres, a pole was erected, to which a flag was affixed. These flags were probably displayed only during the hours of exhibition; and it should seem from a passage in one of the old comedies that they were taken down during Lent, in which season no plays were presented. The Globe, though hexagonal at the outside, was probably a rotunda within, and perhaps had its name from its circular form. It might, however, have been denominated only from its sign, which was a figure of Hercules supporting the Globe. This theatre was burnt down in 1613, but it was rebuilt in the following year, and decorated with more ornament than had been originally bestowed upon it. The exhibitions at the Globe seem to have been calculated chiefly for the lower class of people; those at Blackfriars for a more select and judicious audience.\n\n\"A writer informs us, that one of these theatres was a winter and the other a summer house. As the Globe was partly exposed to the weather, and they acted there usually by daylight, it was probably the summer theatre. The exhibitions here seem to have been more frequent than at Blackfriars, at least till the year 1604 or 1605, when the Bank-side appears to have become less fashionable and less frequented than it formerly had been. Many of our ancient dramatic pieces were performed in the yards of carriers' inns; in which, in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the comedians, who then first united themselves in companies, erected an occasional stage. The form of these temporary playhouses seems to be preserved in our modern theatre. The galleries are in both ranged over each other on three sides of the building. The small rooms under the lowest of these galleries answer to our present boxes; and it is observable that these, even in theatres which were\nwere built in a subsequent period expressly for dramatic exhibitions, still retained their old name, and are frequently called rooms by our ancient writers. The yard bears a sufficient resemblance to the pit, as at present in use. We may suppose the stage to have been raised in this area, on the fourth side, with its back to the gateway of the inn, at which the money for admission was taken. Hence, in the middle of the Globe, and I suppose of the other public theatres, in the time of Shakespeare, there was an open yard or area, where the common people stood to see the exhibition; from which circumstance they are called by our author groundlings, and by Ben Jonson \"the understanding gentlemen of the ground.\"\n\n\"In the ancient playhouses there appears to have been a private box, of which it is not easy to ascertain the situation. It seems to have been placed at the side of the stage towards the rear, and to have been at a lower price: in this some people sat, either from economy or singularity. The galleries, or scaffolds as they are sometimes called, and that part of the house which in private theatres was named the pit, seem to have been at the same price; and probably in houses of reputation, such as the Globe, and that in Blackfriars, the price of admission into those parts of the theatre was 6d. while in some meaner playhouses it was only 1d. in others only 2d. The price of admission into the best rooms or boxes was, I believe, in our author's time, 1s.; though afterwards it appears to have risen to 2s. and half-a-crown.\n\n\"From several passages in our old plays, we learn, that spectators were admitted on the stage, and that the critics and wits of the time usually sat there. Some were placed on the ground; others sat on stools, of which the price was either 6d. or 1s. according; I suppose, to the commodiousness of the situation; and they were attended by pages, who furnished them with pipes and tobacco, which was smoked here as well as in other parts of the house: yet it should seem that persons were suffered to sit on the stage only in the private playhouses, such as Blackfriars, &c., where the audience was more select, and of a higher class; and that in the Globe and other public theatres no such licence was permitted.\n\n\"The stage was firewood with rushes, which, as we learn from Hentzner and Caius de Ephemeris, was, in the time of Shakespeare, the usual covering of floors in England. The curtain which hangs in the front of the present stage, drawn up by lines and pulleys, though not a modern invention, for it was used by Inigo Jones in the masques at court, was yet an apparatus to which the simple mechanism of our ancient theatres had not arrived, for in them the curtains opened in the middle, and were drawn backwards and forwards on an iron rod. In some playhouses they were woollen, in others made of silk.\u2014Towards the rear of the stage there appears to have been a balcony, the platform of which was probably eight or ten feet from the ground. I suppose it to have been supported by pillars. From hence, in many of our old plays, part of the dialogue was spoken; and in the front of this balcony curtains likewise were hung.\n\n\"A doubt has been entertained whether in our ancient theatres there were fide and other scenes. The question is involved in so much obscurity, that it is very difficult to form any decided opinion upon it. It is certain, that in the year 1693 Inigo Jones exhibited an entertainment at Oxford, in which moveable scenes were used; but he appears to have introduced several pieces of machinery in the masques at court, with which undoubtedly the public theatres were unacquainted. A passage which has been produced from one of the old comedies, proves, it must be owned, that even these were furnished with some pieces of machinery, which were used when it was requisite to exhibit the descent of some god or saint; but from all the contemporary accounts, I am inclined to believe that the mechanism of our ancient stage seldom went beyond a painted chair or a trap-door, and that few, if any of them, had any moveable scenes. When King Henry VIII. is to be discovered by the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, in his study, the scenerical direction in the first folio, 1623, which was printed apparently from playhouse copies, is, 'the king draws the curtain, (i.e. draws it open), and sits reading pensively;' for, besides the principal curtains that hung in the front of the stage, they used others as substitutes for scenes. If a bed-chamber is to be exhibited, no change of scene is mentioned; but the property man is simply ordered to thrust forth a bed. When the tale requires the Roman capitol to be exhibited, we find two officers enter, 'to lay cushions, as it were, in the capitol,' &c. On the whole, it appears, that our ancient theatres, in general, were only furnished with curtains, and a single scene composed of tapestry, which were sometimes, perhaps, ornamented with pictures; and some passages in our old dramas incline one to think, that when tragedies were performed the stage was hung with black.\n\n\"In the early part, at least, of our author's acquaintance with the theatre, the want of scenery seems to have been supplied by the simple expedient of writing the names of the different places where the scene was laid in the progress of the play, which were dispensed in such a manner as to be visible to the audience. The invention of trap-doors, however, appears not to be modern; for in an old morality, intitled All for Money, we find a marginal direction which implies that they were very early in use. The covering, or internal roof of the stage, was anciently termed the heavens. It was probably painted of a sky-blue colour, or perhaps pieces of drapery tinged with blue were suspended across the stage to represent the heavens.\n\n\"It is probable that the stage was formerly lighted by two large branches, of a form similar to those now hung in churches. They gave place in a subsequent period to small circular wooden frames, furnished with candles, eight of which were hung on the stage, four at either side, and these within a few years were wholly removed by Mr Garrick, who, on his return from France, first introduced the present commodious method of illuminating the stage by lights not visible to the audience. Many of the companies of players were formerly so thin, that one person played two or three parts; and a battle on which the fate of an empire was supposed to depend was decided by half a dozen combatants. It appears to have been a common practice in their mock engagements to discharge small pieces of ordnance on the stage. Before the exhibition began, three flourishes or pieces of music were played, or, in the ancient language, there were three soundings. Music was likewise played between the acts. The instruments chiefly used were trumpets, cornets, and hautboys.\"\nThe hautboys. The band, which did not consist of more than five or six performers, sat in an upper balcony, over what is now called the stage-box.\n\n\"The person who spoke the prologue was ushered in by trumpets, and usually wore a long black velvet cloak, which, I suppose, was considered as best suited to a supplicatory address. Of this custom, whatever might have been its origin, some traces remained till very lately, a black coat having been, if I mistake not, within these few years, the constant stage-habiment of our modern prologue-speakers. The dress of the ancient prologue-speaker is still retained in the play that is exhibited in Hamlet before the king and court of Denmark. The performers of male characters generally wore periwigs, which in the age of Shakespeare were not in common use. It appears, from a passage in Puttenham's *Art of English Poetry*, 1589, that wigs were worn on some occasions used by the actors of those days; and it may be inferred, from a scene in one of our author's comedies, that they were sometimes worn in his time by those who performed female characters; but this I imagine was very rare. Some of the female part of the audience likewise appeared in masks. The stage-dresses, it is reasonable to suppose, were much more costly at some theatres than at others; yet the wardrobe of even the king's servants at the Globe and Blackfriars, was, we find, but scantily furnished; and our author's dramas derived very little aid from the splendor of exhibition.\n\n\"It is well known, that in the time of Shakespeare, and for many years afterwards, female characters were represented by boys or young men. Sir William d'Avenant, in imitation of the foreign theatres, first introduced females in the scene, and Mrs Betterton is said to have been the first woman that appeared on the English stage. Andrew Pennyquick played the part of Matilda in a tragedy of Davenport's, in 1655; and Mr Kynaston acted several female parts after the Restoration. Downes, a contemporary of his, affirms us, 'that being then very young he made a complete stage beauty, performing his parts so well, particularly Arthiope and Aglaura, that it has since been disputable among the judicious whether any woman that succeeded him touched the audience so sensibly as he.'\n\n\"Both the prompter, or book-holder, as he was sometimes called, and the property-man, appear to have been regular appendages of our ancient theatres. No writer that I have met with intimates, that in the time of Shakespeare it was customary to exhibit more than a single dramatic piece on one day. The Yorkshire tragedy, or *All's One*, indeed, appears to have been one of four pieces that were represented on the same day; and Fletcher has also a piece called *Four Plays in One*; but probably these were either exhibited on some particular occasion, or were ineffectual efforts to introduce a new species of amusement; for we do not find any other instances of the same kind. Had any shorter pieces been exhibited after the principal performance, some of them probably would have been printed: but there are none extant of an earlier date than the time of the Restoration. The practice, therefore, of exhibiting two dramas successively in the same evening, we may be assured was not established before that period. But though the audiences in the time of our author were not gratified by the representation of more than one drama in the same day, the entertainment was diversified, and the populace diverted, by vaulting, tumbling, flight of hand, and morris-dancing, a mixture not much more heterogeneous than that with which we are daily presented, a tragedy and a farce.\n\n\"The amusements of our ancestors, before the commencement of the play, were of various kinds, such as reading, playing at cards, drinking ale, or smoking tobacco. It was a common practice to carry table-books to the theatre, and either from curiosity or enmity to the author, or some other motive, to write down passages of the play that was represented: and there is reason to believe that the imperfect and mutilated copies of some of Shakespeare's dramas, which are yet extant, were taken down in short-hand during the exhibition. At the end of the piece, the actors, in noblemen's houses and in taverns, where plays were frequently performed, prayed for the health and prosperity of their patrons; and in the public theatres for the king and queen. This prayer sometimes made part of the epilogue. Hence, probably, as Mr Steevens has observed, the addition of *Vivat rex et regina* to the modern play-bills.\n\n\"Plays, in the time of our author, began at one o'clock in the afternoon; and the exhibition was usually finished in two hours. Even in 1667 they commenced at three. When Goffon wrote his *School of Abuse*, in 1579, it seems the dramatic entertainments were usually exhibited on Sundays. Afterwards they were performed on that and other days indiscriminately. It appears from a contemporary writer, that exhibiting plays on Sunday had not been abolished in the third year of King Charles I.\n\n\"The modes of conveyance to the theatre, anciently as at present, seem to have been various; some going in coaches, others on horseback, and many by water.\u2014To the Globe playhouse the company probably were conveyed by water; to that in Blackfriars the gentry went either in coaches or on horseback, and the common people on foot. In an epigram to Sir John Davis, the practice of riding to the theatre is ridiculed as a piece of affectation or vanity, and therefore we may presume it was not very general.\n\n\"The long and whimsical titles that are prefixed to the quarto copies of our author's plays, I suppose to have been transcribed from the play-bills of the time. A contemporary writer has preserved something like a play-bill of those days, which seems to corroborate this observation; for if it were deprived of rhyme, it would bear no very distant resemblance to the title pages that stand before some of our author's dramas:\n\n\"Prithee, what's the play?\n(The first I visited this twelvemonth day)\nThey say \"A new invented play of Purle,\nThat jeoparded his neck to steal a girl\nOf twelve; and lying fast impounded for't,\nHas hither sent his beard to act his part;\nAgainst all those in open malice bent,\nThat would not freely to the thief consent:\nFeigns all to's will, and in the epilogue\nGoes out applauded for a famous rogue.\"\n\u2014Now hang me if I did not look at first\nFor some such stuff, by the fond people's thirst.\"\n\n\"It is uncertain at what time the usage of giving authors a benefit on the third day of the exhibition of their pieces commenced. Mr Oldys, in one of his manuscripts, intimates that dramatic poets had anciently their benefit on the first day that a new play was represented; a regulation...\"\nPlayhouse which would have been very favourable to some of the ephemeral productions of modern times. But for this there is not, I believe, any sufficient authority. From D'Avenant, indeed, we learn, that in the latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the poet had his benefit on the second day. As it was a general practice in the time of Shakespeare to sell the copy of the play to the theatre, I imagine in such cases an author derived no other advantage from his piece than what arose from the sale of it. Sometimes, however, he found it more beneficial to retain the copyright in his own hands; and when he did so, I suppose he had a benefit. It is certain that the giving authors the profit of the third exhibition of their play, which seems to have been the usual mode during almost the whole of the last century, was an established custom in the year 1612, for Dekker, in the prologue to one of his comedies printed in that year, speaks of the poet's third day. The unfortunate Olway had no more than one benefit on the production of a new play; and this too, it seems, he was sometimes forced to mortgage before the piece was acted. Southerne was the first dramatic writer who obtained the emoluments arising from two representations; and to Farquhar, in the year 1703, the benefit of a third was granted. When an author sold his piece to the sharers or proprietors of a theatre, it remained for several years unpublished; but when that was not the case, he printed it for sale, to which many seem to have been induced, from an apprehension that an imperfect copy might be issued from the press without their consent. The customary price of the copy of a play in the time of Shakespeare appears to have been twenty nobles, or five pounds thirteen shillings and four pence. The play when printed was sold for sixpence; and the usual present from a patron in return for a dedication was forty shillings. On the first day of exhibiting a new play, the prices of admission appear to have been raised; and this seems to have been occasionally practised on the benefit-nights of authors to the end of the last century. The custom of affording a final censure on plays at their first exhibition is as ancient as the time of our author; for no less than three plays of his rival Ben Jonson appear to have been damned; and Fletcher's Faithful Shepherdess, and The Knight of the Burning Pestle, written by him and Beaumont, underwent the same fate.\n\n\"It is not easy to ascertain what were the emoluments of a successful actor in the time of Shakespeare. They had not then annual benefits as at present. The performers at each theatre seem to have shared the profits arising either from each day's exhibition or from the whole season among them.\" From Ben Jonson's Poetaster we learn, that one of either the performers or proprietors had seven shares and a half; but of what integral sum is not mentioned. From the prices of admission into our ancient theatres, which have been already mentioned, I imagine the utmost that the sharers of the Globe playhouse could have received on any one day was about \u00a35. So lately as the year 1685, Shadwell received by his third day on the representation of the Squire of Alsatia, \u00a3130.; which Downes the prompter says was the greatest receipt that had ever been taken at Drury-Lane playhouse at single prices. It appears from the MSS. of Lord Stanhope, treasurer of the chambers to King James I., that the customary sum paid to John Heminge and his company for the performance of a play at court was twenty nobles, or five pounds thirteen shillings and four pence. And Edward Alleyn mentions in his Diary, that he once had so slender an audience in his theatre called the Fortune, that the whole receipts of the house amounted to no more than three pounds and some odd shillings.\n\n\"Thus scanty and meagre were the apparatus and accommodations of our ancient theatres, on which those dramas were first exhibited, that have since engaged the attention of so many learned men, and delighted to many thousand spectators. Yet even then, we are told by a writer of that age, 'that dramatic poetry was so lively expressed and represented on the public stages and theatres of this city, as Rome in the age of her pomp and glory never saw it better performed; in respect of the action and art, not of the coit and sumptuousness.'\"","sp":260,"ep":263},{"h":"PLAYERS","t":"in fortification, denote a kind of balance used in raising or letting down a draw-bridge. They consist of two timber levers, twice as long as the bridge they lift, joined together by other timbers framed in the form of a St Andrew's cross to counterpoise them. They are supported by two upright jambs, on which they swing; and the bridge is raised or let down by means of chains joining the ends of the players and bridge.","sp":287,"ep":287},{"h":"PLEA","t":"in Law, is what either party alleges for himself in court, in a cause there depending; and in a more restrained sense, it is the defendant's answer to the plaintiff's declaration.\n\nPleadings are usually divided into those of the crown and common pleas. Pleas of the crown are all suits in the king's name, or in the name of the attorney-general in behalf of the king, for offences committed against his crown and dignity, and against his peace; as treason, murder, felony, &c. See ARRRAIGNMENT.\n\nCommon pleas are such suits as are carried on between common persons in civil causes. These pleas are of two sorts; dilatory pleas, and pleas to the action. Dilatory pleas are such as tend merely to delay or put off the suit, by questioning the propriety of the remedy, rather than by denying the injury; pleas to the action are such as dispute the very cause of suit.\n\n1. Dilatory pleas are,\n\n1. To the jurisdiction of the court: alleging, that it ought not to hold plea of this injury, it arising in Wales or beyond sea: or because the land in question is of ancient demesne, and ought only to be demanded in the lord's court, &c.\n\n2. To the disability of the plaintiff, by reason whereof he is incapable to commence or continue the suit; as, that he is an alien enemy, outlawed, excommunicated, attainted of treason or felony, under a praemunire, not in rerum natura (being only a fictitious person), an infant, a feme-covert, or a monk professed.\n\n3. In abatement: which abatement is either of the writ, or the count, for some defect in one of them; as by misnaming the defendant, which is called a misnomer; giving him a wrong addition, as esquire instead of knight; or other want of form in any material respect. Or, it may be that the plaintiff is dead; for the death of either party is at once an abatement of the suit.\n\nThese pleas to the jurisdiction, to the disability, or in abatement, were formerly very often used as mere dilatory pleas, without any foundation in truth, and calculated only for delay; but now by flat. 4 & 5 Ann. c. 16, no dilatory plea is to be admitted without affidavit made of the truth thereof, or some probable matter thrown to the court to induce them to believe it true. And with respect to the pleas themselves, it is a rule, that no exception shall be admitted against a declaration or writ, unless the defendant will in the same plea give the plaintiff a better; that is, show him how it might be amended, that there may not be two objections upon the same account.\nAll pleas to the jurisdiction conclude to the cognizance of the court; praying \"judgement whether the court will have farther cognizance of the suit.\" Pleas to the disability conclude to the person; by praying \"judgement, if the said A the plaintiff ought to be answered.\" And pleas in abatement (when the suit is by original) conclude to the writ, or declaration; by praying \"judgement of the writ, or declaration, and that the same may be quashed,\" estteur, made void, or abated: but if the action be by bill, the plea must pray \"judgement of the bill,\" and not of the declaration; the bill being here the original, and the declaration only a copy of the bill.\n\nWhen these dilatory pleas are allowed, the cause is either dismissed from that jurisdiction, or the plaintiff is stayed till his disability be removed; or he is obliged to sue out a new writ, by leave obtained from the court, or to amend and new-frame his declaration. But when, on the other hand, they are overruled as frivolous, the defendant has judgement of respondent ouster, or to answer over in some better manner. It is then incumbent on him to plead.\n\n2. A plea to the action; that is, to answer to the merits of the complaint. This is done by confessing or denying it.\n\nA confession of the whole complaint is not very usual; for then the defendant would probably end the matter sooner, or not plead at all, but suffer judgement to go by default. Yet sometimes, after tender and refusal of a debt, if the creditor harasses his debtor with an action, it then becomes necessary for the defendant to acknowledge the debt, and plead the tender; adding, that he has always been ready, tout temps prif, and is still ready, uncore prif, to discharge it: for a tender by the debtor and refusal by the creditor will in all cases discharge the costs, but not the debt itself; though in some particular cases the creditor will totally lose his money. But frequently the defendant confesses one part of the complaint (by a cognovit actionem in respect thereof), and traverses or denies the rest; in order to avoid the expense of carrying that part to a formal trial, which he has no ground to litigate. A species of this sort of confession is the payment of money into court: which is for the most part necessary upon pleading a tender, and is itself a kind of tender to the plaintiff; by paying into the hands of the proper officer of the court as much as the defendant acknowledges to be due, together with the costs hitherto incurred, in order to prevent the expense of any farther proceedings. This may be done upon what is called a motion; which is an occasional application to the court by the parties or their counsel, in order to obtain some rule or order of court, which becomes necessary in the progress of a cause: and it is usually grounded upon an affidavit (the perfect tense of the verb affido), being a voluntary oath before some judge or officer of the court, to convince the truth of certain facts, upon which the motion is grounded: though no such affidavit is necessary for payment of money into court. If, after the money is paid in, the plaintiff proceeds in his suit, it is at his own peril: for if he does not prove more due than is so paid into court, he shall be nonsuited and pay the defendant's costs; but he shall still have the money so paid in, for that the defendant has acknowledged to be his due. To this head may also be referred the practice of what is called a fet off; whereby the defendant acknowledges the justice of the plaintiff's demand on the one hand; but on the other, sets up a demand of his own, to counterbalance that of the plaintiff, either in the whole or in part; as, if the plaintiff sues for ten pounds due on a note of hand, the defendant may set off nine pounds due to himself for merchandise sold to the plaintiff; and, in case he plead such fet-off, must pay the remaining balance into court.\n\nPleas that totally deny the cause of complaint are either the general issue, or a special plea in bar.\n\n1. The general issue, or general plea, is what traverses, thwarts, and denies at once, the whole declaration, without offering any special matter whereby to evade it. As in trespas either vi et armis, or on the case, \"non culpabilis, not guilty?\" in debt upon contract, \"nihil debet, he owes nothing;\" in debt on bond, non est factum, it is not his deed;\" on an assumpsit, \"non assumpsit, he made no such promise.\" Or in real actions, \"nul tort, no wrong done; nul dillefin, no dillefin;\" and in a writ of right, the mile or issue is, that \"the tenant has more right to hold than the demandant has to demand.\" These pleas are called the general issue, because, by importing an absolute and general denial of what is alleged in the declaration, they amount at once to an issue; by which we mean a fact affirmed on one side and denied on the other.\n\n2. Special pleas in bar of the plaintiff's demands are very various, according to the circumstances of the defendant's case. As, in real actions, a general release or a fine; both of which may destroy and bar the plaintiff's title. Or, in personal actions, an accord, arbitration, conditions performed, nonage of the defendant, or some other fact which precludes the plaintiff from his action. A justification is likewise a special plea in bar; as in actions of assault and battery, non assault dementhe, that it was the plaintiff's own original assault; in trespasses, that the defendant did the thing complained of in right of some office which warranted him so to do; or, in an action of slander, that the plaintiff is really as bad a man as the defendant said he was.\n\nAlso a man may plead the statutes of limitation in bar; or the time limited by certain acts of parliament, beyond which no plaintiff can lay his cause of action. This, by the statute of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 2, in a writ of right is 60 years: in alizes, writs of entry, or other possessory actions real, of the seisin of one's ancestors in lands; and either of their seisin, or one's own, in rents, suits, and services, 50 years: and in actions real for lands grounded upon one's own seisin or possession, such possession must have been within 30 years. By statute 1 Mar. st. 2, c. 5, this limitation does not extend to any suit for avowons. But by the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 2, a time of limitation was extended to the case of the king; viz. 60 years precedent to 19th Feb. 1623; but, this becoming ineffectual by efflux of time, the same date of limitation was fixed by statute 9 Geo. III. c. 16, to commence and be reckoned backwards, from the time of bringing any suit or other process to recover the thing in question; so that a possession for 60 years is now a bar even against the prerogative, in derogation of the ancient maxim, Nullum tempus occurrit regi. By another statute, 21 Jac. I. c. 16, 20 years is the time of limitation in any writ of formondem: and, by a consequence, 20 years is also the limitation in every action of ejectment; for no ejectment can be brought, unless where\nwhere the lessor of the plaintiff is entitled to enter on the lands, and by the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 16. no entry can be made by any man, unless within 20 years after his right shall accrue. Also all actions of trespass (quare clausum fregit, or otherwise), detinue, trover, replevin, account, and case (except upon accounts between merchants), debt on simple contract, or for arrears of rent, are limited by the statute last mentioned to five years after the cause of action commenced; and actions of assault, menace, battery, mayhem, and imprisonment, must be brought within four years, and actions for words two years, after the injury committed. And by the statute 31 Eliz. c. 5. all suits, indictments, and informations, upon any penal statutes, where any forfeiture is to the crown, shall be sued within two years, and where the forfeiture is to a subject, within one year, after the offence committed, unless where any other time is specially limited by the statute. Lastly, by statute 10 W. III. c. 14. no writ of error, feire facias, or other suit, shall be brought to reverse any judgment, fine, or recovery, for error, unless it be prosecuted within 20 years. The use of these statutes of limitation is to preserve the peace of the kingdom, and to prevent those innumerable perjuries which might ensue if a man were allowed to bring an action for any injury committed at any distance of time. Upon both these accounts the law therefore holds, that interest reipublicae ut fit finis illium: and upon the same principle the Athenian laws in general prohibited all actions where the injury was committed five years before the complaint was made. If therefore, in any suit, the injury, or cause of action, happened earlier than the period expressly limited by law, the defendant may plead the statutes of limitations in bar: as upon an affumpst, or promise to pay money to the plaintiff, the defendant may plead, Non affumpst infra sex annos, He made no such promise within five years; which is an effectual bar to the complaint.\n\nAn etoppel is likewise a special plea in bar; which happens where a man hath done some act, or executed some deed, which etops or precludes him from averring any thing to the contrary. As if a tenant for years (who hath no freehold) levies a fine to another person. Though this is void as to strangers, yet it shall work as an etoppel to the cognizance; for, if he afterwards brings an action to recover these lands, and his fine is pleaded against him, he shall thereby be etopped from saying, that he had no freehold at the time, and therefore was incapable of levying it.\n\nThe conditions and qualities of a plea (which, as well as the doctrine of ettoppels, will also hold equally, mutatis mutandis, with regard to other parts of pleading), are, 1. That it be single and containing only one matter; for duplicity begets confusion. But by statute 4 and 5 Ann. c. 16. a man, with leave of the court, may plead two or more distinct matters or single pleas; as in an action of assault and battery, these three, Not guilty, sin assault demesne, and the statute of limitations. 2. That it be direct and positive, and not argumentative. 3. That it have convenient certainty of time, place, and persons. 4. That it answer the plaintiff's allegations in every material point. 5. That it be so pleaded as to be capable of trial.\n\nSpecial pleas are usually in the affirmative, sometimes in the negative, but they always advance some new fact not mentioned in the declaration; and then they must be averred to be true in the common form:\u2014\u201cAnd this he is ready to verify.\u201d\u2014This is not necessary in pleas of the general issue, those always containing a total denial of the facts before advanced by the other party, and therefore putting him upon the proof of them. See PLEADINGS.\n\nPLEA to Indictment, the defensive matter alleged by a Blackfriar criminal on his indictment; (see ARRAIGNMENT.) This Comment is either, 1. A plea to the jurisdiction; 2. A demurrer; 3. A plea in abatement; 4. A special plea in bar; or, 5. The general issue.\n\nI. A plea to the jurisdiction, is where an indictment is taken before a court that hath no cognizance of the offence; as if a man be indicted for a rape at the sheriff's town, or for treason at the quarter-sessions: in these or similar cases, he may except to the jurisdiction of the court, without answering at all to the crime alleged.\n\nII. A demurrer to the indictment, is incident to criminal cases, as well as civil, when the fact as alleged is allowed to be true, but the prisoner joins issue upon some point of law in the indictment, by which he infers, that the fact, as stated, is no felony, treason, or whatever the crime is alleged to be. Thus, for instance, if a man be indicted for feloniously stealing a greyhound; which is an animal in which no valuable property can be had, and therefore it is not felony, but only a civil trespass to steal it; in this case the party indicted may demur to the indictment; denying it to be felony, though he confesses the act of taking it. Some have held, that if, on demurrer, the point of law be adjudged against the prisoner, he shall have judgement and execution, as if convicted by verdict. But this is denied by others, who hold, that in such case he shall be directed and received to plead the general issue, Not guilty, after a demurrer determined against him. Which appears the more reasonable, because it is clear, that if the prisoner freely discovers the fact in court, and refers it to the opinion of the court whether it be felony or not; and upon the fact thus shown, it appears to be felony, the court will not record the confession, but admit him afterwards to plead not guilty. And this seems to be a case of the same nature, being for the most part a mistake in point of law, and in the conduct of his pleading; and, though a man by mispleading may in some cases lose his property, yet the law will not suffer him by such niceties to lose his life. However, upon this doubt, demurrers to indictments are seldom used; since the same advantages may be taken upon a plea of not guilty; or afterwards, in arrest of judgement, when the verdict has established the fact.\n\nIII. A plea in abatement is principally for a misnomer, a wrong name, or a false addition to the prisoner. As, if James Allen, gentleman, is indicted by the name of John Allen, esquire, he may plead that he has the name of James, and not of John; and that he is a gentleman, and not an esquire. And, if either fact is found by a jury, then the indictment shall be abated, as writs or declarations may be in civil actions. But, in the end, there is little advantage accruing to the prisoner by means of these dilatory pleas; because, if the exception be allowed, a new bill of indictment may be framed, according to what the prisoner in his plea avers to be his true name and addition. For it is a rule, upon all pleas in abatement, that he who takes advantage of a flaw,\nmust at the same time show how it may be amended.\n\nLet us therefore next consider a more substantial kind of plea, viz.\n\nIV. Special pleas in bar; which go to the merits of the indictment, and give a reason why the prisoner ought not to answer it at all, nor put himself upon his trial for the crime alleged. These are of four kinds: a former acquittal, a former conviction, a former attainder, or a pardon. There are many other pleas which may be pleaded in bar of an appeal; but these are applicable to both appeals and indictments.\n\n1. First, the plea of auterfoits acquit, or a former acquittal, is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life, more than once, for the same offence. And hence it is allowed as a consequence, that when a man is once fairly found not guilty upon any indictment, or other prosecution, before any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence, he may plead such acquittal in bar of any subsequent accusation for the same crime.\n\n2. Secondly, the plea of auterfoits convict, or a former conviction for the same identical crime, though no judgement was ever given, or perhaps will be (being suspended by the benefit of clergy or other causes), is a good plea in bar to an indictment. And this depends upon the same principle as the former, that no man ought to be twice brought in danger of his life for one and the same crime.\n\n3. Thirdly, the plea of auterfoits attaint, or a former attainder, is a good plea in bar, whether it be for the same or any other felony. For wherever a man is attainted of felony, by judgement of death either upon a verdict or confession, by outlawry, or heresiofore by abjuration, and whether upon an appeal or an indictment; he may plead such attainder in bar to any subsequent indictment or appeal, for the same or for any other felony. And this because, generally, such proceeding on a second prosecution cannot be to any purpose; for the prisoner is dead in law by the first attainder, his blood is already corrupted, and he hath forfeited all that he had: so that it is absurd and superfluous to endeavour to attain him a second time. Though to this general rule, as to all others, there are some exceptions; wherein, cestant ratione, estat et ipsa lex.\n\n4. Lastly, a pardon may be pleaded in bar; as at once destroying the end and purpose of the indictment, by remitting that punishment, which the prosecution is calculated to inflict. There is one advantage that attends pleading a pardon in bar, or in the arrest of judgement before sentence is past; which gives it by much the preference to pleading it after sentence or attainder. This is, that by stopping the judgement it stops the attainder, and prevents the corruption of the blood: which, when once corrupted by attainder, cannot afterwards be restored otherwise than by act of parliament.\n\nV. The general issue, or plea of not guilty, upon which plea alone the prisoner can receive his final judgement of death. In case of an indictment of felony or treason, there can be no special justification put in by way of plea. As, on an indictment for murder, a man cannot plead that it was in his own defence against a robber on the highway, or a burglar; but he must plead the general issue, Not guilty, and give this special matter in evidence. For (besides that these pleas do in effect amount to the general issue; since, if true, the prisoner is most clearly not guilty) as the facts in treason are laid to be done proditoriae et contra ligamentis sine debitione; and, in felony, that the killing was done felonice; these charges, of a traitorous or felonious intent, are the points and very gist of the indictment, and must be answered directly, by the general negative, Not guilty; and the jury upon the evidence will take notice of any defensive matter, and give their verdict accordingly as effectually as if it were or could be specially pleaded. So that this is, upon all accounts, the most advantageous plea for the prisoner.\n\nWhen the prisoner hath thus pleaded not guilty, non culpabilis, or nient culpable: which was formerly used to be abbreviated upon the minutes, thus, Non (or nient) cul, the clerk of the affize, or clerk of arraigns, on behalf of the crown, replies, that the prisoner is guilty, and that he is ready to prove him so. This is done by two monosyllables in the same spirit of abbreviation, (cul pri); which signifies first that the prisoner is guilty, (cul culpable, or culpabilis); and then that the king is ready to prove him so, (pri, pretio firm, or paratus, sacrificare). By this replication the king and the prisoner are therefore at issue: for when the parties come to a fact which is affirmed on one side and denied on the other, then they are said to be at issue in point of fact; which is evidently the case here, in the plea of non cul, by the prisoner; and the replication of cul, by the clerk.\n\nHow the courts came to express a matter of this importance in so odd and obscure a manner, can hardly be pronounced with certainty. It may perhaps, however, be accounted for by supposing, that these were at first short notes, to help the memory of the clerk, and remind him what he was to reply; or else it was the short method of taking down in court, upon the minutes, the replication and averment; cul pri; which afterwards the ignorance of succeeding clerks adopted for the very words to be by them spoken (A).\n\nBut however it may have arisen, the joining of issue seems to be clearly the meaning of this obscure expression; which has puzzled our most ingenious etymologists, and is commonly understood as if the clerk of the arraigns, immediately on plea pleaded, had fixed an opprobrious name on the prisoner, by asking him, \"culprit, how wilt thou be tried?\" for immediately upon issue joined it is inquired of the prisoner, by what trial he will make his innocence appear. This form has at present reference to appeals and approvements only, wherein the appellee has his choice, either to try the accusation by\n\n---\n\n(A) Of this ignorance we may see daily instances, in the abuse of two legal terms of ancient French: one the prologue to all proclamations, \"Oyez, or Hear ye,\" which is generally pronounced, most unmeaningly, \"Oyes;\" the other, a more pardonable mistake, viz. when a jury are all sworn, the officer bids the oyer number them, for which the word in law-French is, \"Countez;\" but we now hear it pronounced in very good English, \"Count thele.\"\nPLEA\n\nBut upon indictments, since the abolition of ORDEAL, there can be no other trial but by jury, per pais, or by the country; and therefore, if the prisoner refuses to put himself upon the inquest in the usual form, that is, to answer that he will be tried by God and the country, if a commoner; and, if a peer, by God and his peers; the indictment, if in treason, is taken pro confesso; and the prisoner, in cases of felony, is judged to stand mute, and, if he perseveres in his obstinacy, shall now be convicted of the felony.\n\nWhen the prisoner has thus put himself upon his trial, the clerk answers in the humane language of the law, which always hopes that the party's innocence rather than his guilt may appear, \"God send thee a good deliverance.\" And then they proceed, as soon as conveniently may be, to the trial. See the article TRIAL.","sp":263,"ep":267},{"h":"PLEADINGS","t":"in Law, are the mutual alterations between the plaintiff and defendant, (see SUIT, WRIT, and PROCESS). They form the third part or stage of a fact; and at present are set down and delivered into the proper office in writing; though formerly they were usually put in by their counsel ore tenus, or viae voce, in court, and then minuted down by the chief clerks or prothonotaries; whence, in our old law-French, the pleadings are frequently denominated the parol.\n\nThe first of these is the declaration, narration, or count, anciently called the tale; in which the plaintiff sets forth his cause of complaint at length: being indeed only an amplification or exposition of the original writ upon which his action is founded, with the additional circumstances of time and place, when and where, the injury was committed.\n\nIn local actions, where possession of land is to be recovered, or damages for an actual trespass, or for waste, &c., affecting land, the plaintiff must lay his declaration, or declare his injury to have happened in the very county and place that it really did happen; but in transitory actions, for injuries that might have happened anywhere, as debt, detinue, flander, and the like, the plaintiff may declare in what county he pleads, and then the trial must be in that county in which the declaration is laid. Though, if the defendant will make affidavit that the cause of action, if any, arose not in that but another county, the court will direct a change of the venue or vicinie (that is, the vicinia or neighbourhood in which the injury is declared to be done), and will oblige the plaintiff to declare in the proper county.\n\nFor the statute 6 Ric. II. c. 2. having ordered all writs to be laid in their proper counties, this, as the judges conceived, impowred them to change the venue, if required, and not to insist rigidly on abating the writ: which practice began in the reign of James I. And this power is discretionally exercised, so as not to cause but prevent a defect of justice. Therefore the court will not change the venue to any of the four northern counties previous to the spring circuit; because there the assizes are holden only once a-year, at the time of summer circuit. And it will sometimes remove the venue from the proper jurisdiction (especially of the narrow and limited kind), upon a suggestion, duly supported, that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had therein.\n\nIt is generally usual, in actions upon the case, to set forth several cases, by different counts in the same declaration; so that if the plaintiff fails in the proof of one, he may succeed in another. As in an action on the case upon an assumptio for goods sold and delivered, the plaintiff usually counts or declares, first, upon a fettered and agreed price between him and the defendant; as, that they bargained for \u00a320.; and left he should fail in the proof of this, he counts likewise upon a quantum valebat; that the defendant bought other goods, and agreed to pay him so much as they were reasonably worth: and then avers that they were worth other \u00a320. and so on in three or four different shapes; and at last concludes with declaring, that the defendant had refused to fulfil any of these agreements, whereby he is endangered to lose a value. And if he proves the case laid in any one of his counts, though he fails in the rest, he shall recover proportionable damages. This declaration always concludes with these words, \"and thereupon he brings suit,\" &c. (ad producit seetam, &c.) By which words, suit or seeta (a sequela), were anciently understood the witnesses or followers of the plaintiff. For in former times, the law would not put the defendant to the trouble of answering the charge till the plaintiff had made out at least a probable case. But the actual production of the suit, seeta, or follower, is now antiquated, and hath been totally disused, at least ever since the reign of Edward III., though the form of it still continues.\n\nAt the end of the declaration are added also the plaintiff's common pledges of prosecution, John Dee and Richard Roe; which, as we elsewhere observe, (see WRIT), are now mere names of form; though formerly they were of use to answer to the king for the arrearsment of the plaintiff, in case he were nonjusticed, barred of his action, or had a verdict and judgment against him. For if the plaintiff neglects to deliver a declaration for two terms after the defendant appears, or is guilty of other delays or defaults against the rules of law in any subsequent stage of the action, he is adjudged not to follow or pursue his remedy as he ought to do; and thereupon a nonjustit, or non prosequitur, is entered, and he is said to be non-press'd. And for thus deferring his complaint, after making a false claim or complaint (pro falso clamore fio), he shall not only pay costs to the defendant, but is liable to be amerced to the king. A retraxit differs from a nonjustit, in that the one is negative and the other positive: the nonjustit is a default and neglect of the plaintiff, and therefore he is allowed to begin his suit again upon payment of costs; but a retraxit is an open and voluntary renunciation of his suit in court; and by this he for ever loses his action. A discontinueance is somewhat similar to a nonjustit; for when a plaintiff leaves a claim in the proceedings of his cause, as by not-continuing the process regularly from day to day, and time to time, as he ought to do, the suit is discontinued, and the defendant is no longer bound to attend; but the plaintiff must begin again, by suing out a new original, usually paying costs to his antagonist.\n\nWhen the plaintiff hath stated his case in the declaration, it is incumbent on the defendant, within a reasonable time, to make his defence, and put in a plea; or else the plaintiff will at once recover judgment by default, or nihil dicit, of the defendant.\n\nDefence, in its true legal sense, signifies not a justification, protection, or guard, which is now its popular signification; but merely an opposing or denial (from the French verb defendre) of the truth or validity of the complaint.\npleadings complaint. It is the *contestation* of the civilians: a general assertion that the plaintiff hath no ground of action; which assertion is afterwards extended and maintained in his plea.\n\nBefore defence made, if at all, cognizance of the suit must be claimed or demanded; when any person or body-corporate hath the franchise, not only of holding pleas within a particular limited jurisdiction, but also of the cognizance of pleas; and that either without any words exclusive of other courts, which intitle the lord of the franchise, whenever any suit that belongs to his jurisdiction is commenced in the courts at Westminster, to demand the cognizance thereof; or with such exclusive words, which also intitle the defendant to plead to the jurisdiction of the court. Upon this claim of cognizance, if allowed, all proceedings shall cease in the superior court, and the plaintiff is left at liberty to pursue his remedy in the special jurisdiction. As, when a scholar or other privileged person of the universities of Oxford or Cambridge is impleaded in the courts at Westminster, for any cause of action whatsoever, unless upon a question of freehold. In these cases, by the charter of those learned bodies, confirmed by act of parliament, the chancellor, or vice-chancellor, may put in a claim of cognizance; which, if made in due time and form, and with due proof of the facts alleged, is regularly allowed by the courts. It must be demanded before full defence is made or appearance prayed; for these are a submission to the jurisdiction of the superior court, and the delay is a *laches* in the lord of the franchise: and it will not be allowed if it occasions a failure of justice, or if an action be brought against the person himself who claims the franchise, unless he hath also a power in such case of making another judge.\n\nAfter defence made, the defendant must put in his plea. But before he defends, if the suit is commenced by *capias* or *libet*, without any special original, he is intitled to demand one *imparlance*, or *licentia loquendi*; and may, before he pleads, have more granted by consent of the court, to see if he can end the matter amicably without farther suit, by talking with the plaintiff: a practice which is supposed to have arisen from a principle of religion, in obedience to that precept of the gospel, \"agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him.\" And it may be observed, that this gospel-precept has a plain reference to the Roman law of the twelve tables, which expressly directed the plaintiff and defendant to make up the matter while they were in the way, or going to the praetor:\u2014*in via, rem uti pacient orato*. There are also many other previous steps which may be taken by a defendant before he puts in his plea. He may, in real actions, demand a view of the thing in question, in order to ascertain its identity and other circumstances. He may crave *quer* of the writ, or of the bond, or other specialty upon which the action is brought; that is, to hear it read to him; the generality of defendants in the times of ancient simplicity being supposed incapable to read it themselves: whereupon the whole is entered *verbatim* upon the record; and the defendant may take advantage of any condition, or other part of it, not stated in the plaintiff's declaration. In real actions also the tenant may pray in aid, or call for the assistance of another, to help him to plead, because of the feebleness or imbecility of his own estate. Thus a tenant for life may pray in aid of him that hath the inheritance in remainder or rever- fission; and an incumbent may pray in aid of the patron and ordinary; that is, that they shall be joined in the action, and help to defend the title. *Voucher* also is the calling in of some person to answer the action, that hath warranted the title to the tenant or defendant. This we still make use of in the form of common recoveries, which are grounded on a writ of entry; a species of action that relies chiefly on the weakness of the tenant's title, who therefore vouches another person to warrant it. If the voucher appear, he is made defendant instead of the voucher; but if he afterwards makes default, recovery shall be had against the original defendant; and he shall recover an equivalent in value against the deficient vouchee. In assizes, indeed, where the principal question is, whether the demandant or his ancestors were or were not in possession till the outset happened, and the title of the tenant is little (if at all) difficult, there no voucher is allowed; but the tenant may bring a writ of *warrantia chartae* against the warrantor, to compel him to affit him with a good plea or defence, or else to render damages and the value of the land, if recovered against the tenant. In many real actions also, brought by or against an infant under the age of 21 years, and also in actions of debt brought against him, as heir to any deceased ancestor, either party may suggest the nonage of the infant, and pray that the proceedings may be deferred till his full age, or, in our legal phrase, that the infant may have his age, and that the *parol* may *demur*, that is, that the pleadings may be laid; and then they shall not proceed till his full age, unless it be apparent that he cannot be prejudiced thereby. But by the statutes of Westminster, 3 Edw. I. c. 46. and of Glocester, 6 Edw. I. c. 2. in writs of entry *for differi* in some particular cases, and in actions ancestrally brought by an infant, the parol shall not demur; otherwise he might be deprived of his whole property, and even want a maintenance, till he came of age. So likewise in a writ of dower the heir shall not have his age; for it is necessary that the widow's claim be immediately determined, else she may want a present subsistence. Nor shall an infant patron have it in a *quare impedit*, since the law holds it necessary and expedient that the church be immediately filled.\n\nWhen these proceedings are over, the defendant must then put in his excuse or plea. See *PLEA*.\n\nIt is a rule in pleading, that no man be allowed to plead specially such a plea as amounts only to the general issue, or a total denial of the charge; but in such case he shall be driven to plead the general issue in terms, whereby the whole question is referred to a jury. But if the defendant, in an assize or action of trespass, be desirous to refer the validity of his title to the court rather than the jury, he may state his title specially; and at the same time give colour to the plaintiff, or suppose him to have an appearance or colour of title, bad indeed in point of law, but of which the jury are not competent judges. As if his own true title is, that he claims by seisinment with livery from A, by force of which he entered on the lands in question, he cannot plead this by itself, as it amounts to no more than the general issue, *null tort, null differi*, in assize, or not guilty in an action of trespass. But he may allege this specially, provided he goes farther, and says, that the plaintiff claiming by colour of a prior deed of seisinment, without\nPLE\n\nPleadings out livery, entered; upon whom he entered; and may then refer himself to the judgement of the court which of these two titles is the best in point of law.\n\nWhen the plea of the defendant is thus put in, if it does not amount to an issue or total contradiction of the declaration, but only evades it, the plaintiff may plead again, and reply to the defendant's plea: Either traversing it, that is, totally denying it; as if, on an action of debt upon bond, the defendant pleads falsum ad diem, that he paid the money when due; here the plaintiff in his replication may totally traverse this plea, by denying that the defendant paid it: Or he may allege new matter in contradiction to the defendant's plea; as when the defendant pleads no award made, the plaintiff may reply, and set forth an actual award, and assign a breach: Or the replication may confess and avoid the plea, by some new matter or distinction, consistent with the plaintiff's former declaration; as in an action for trespassing upon land whereof the plaintiff is seized, if the defendant shows a title to the land by descent, and that therefore he had a right to enter, and gives colour to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may either traverse and totally deny the fact of the descent; or he may confess and avoid it, by replying, that true it is that such descent happened, but that since the descent the defendant himself demised the lands to the plaintiff for term of life.\n\nTo the replication the defendant may rejoin, or put in an answer called a rejoinder. The plaintiff may answer the rejoinder by a fur-rejoinder; upon which the defendant may rebut, and the plaintiff answer him by a fur-rebutter. Which pleas, replications, rejoinders, fur-rejoinders, rebutters, and fur-rebutters, answer to the exceptio, replicatio, duplicatio, triplicatio, and quadruplicatio, of the Roman laws.\n\nThe whole of this process is denominated the pleading; in the several stages of which it must be carefully observed, not to depart or vary from the title or defence which the party has once insisted on. For this (which is called a departure in pleading) might occasion endless altercation. Therefore the replication must support the declaration, and the rejoinder must support the plea, without departing out of it. As in the case of pleading no award made in consequence of a bond of arbitration, to which the plaintiff replies, setting forth an actual award; now the defendant cannot rejoin that he hath performed this award, for such rejoinder would be an entire departure from his original plea, which alleged that no such award was made: therefore he has now no other choice, but to traverse the fact of the replication, or else to deny upon the law of it.\n\nAgain, all duplicity in pleading must be avoided. Every plea must be simple, entire, connected, and confined to one single point: it must never be entangled with a variety of distinct independent answers to the same matter; which must require as many different replies, and introduce a multitude of issues upon one and the same dispute. For this would often embarrass the jury, and sometimes the court itself, and at all events would greatly enhance the expense of the parties. Yet it frequently is expedient to plead in such a manner as to avoid any implied admission of a fact, which cannot with propriety or safety be positively affirmed or denied. And this may be done by what is called a protestation; whereby the party interposes an oblique allegation or denial of some fact, protesting (by the gerund, protestan-\n\ndo) that such a matter does or does not exist; and at the same time avoiding a direct affirmation or denial. Sir Edward Coke hath defined a protestation (in the pithy dialect of that age) to be, \"an exclusion of a conclusion.\" For the use of it is, to save the party from being concluded with respect to some fact or circumstance which cannot be directly affirmed or denied without falling into duplicity of pleading; and which yet, if he did not thus enter his protest, he might be deemed to have tacitly waived or admitted. Thus, while tenure in villainage subsisted, if a villain had brought an action against his lord, and the lord was inclined to try the merits of the demand, and at the same time to prevent any conclusion against himself that he had waived his figuory; he could not in this case both plead affirmatively that the plaintiff was his villain, and also take issue upon the demand; for then his plea would have been double, as the former alone would have been a good bar to the action: but he might have alleged the villainage of the plaintiff by way of protestation, and then have denied the demand. By this means the future vafalage of the plaintiff was saved to the defendant, in case the issue was found in his (the defendant's?) favour; for the protestation prevented that conclusion which would otherwise have resulted from the rest of his defence, that he had enfranchised the plaintiff, since no villain could maintain a civil action against his lord. So also if a defendant, by way of inducement to the point of his defence, alleges (among other matters) a particular mode of seisin or tenure which the plaintiff is unwilling to admit, and yet desires to take issue on the principal point of the defence, he must deny the seisin or tenure by way of protestation, and then traverse the defensive matter. So, lastly, if an award be set forth by the plaintiff, and he can assign a breach in one part of it (viz. the non-payment of a sum of money), and yet is afraid to admit the performance of the rest of the award, or to aver in general a non-performance of any part of it, lest something should appear to have been performed; he may save to himself any advantage he might hereafter make of the general non-performance, by alleging that by protestation, he can plead only the non-payment of the money.\n\nIn any stage of the pleadings, when either side advances or affirms any new matter, he usually (as was said) avers it to be true; \"and this he is ready to verify.\" On the other hand, when either side traverses or denies the facts pleaded by his antagonist, he usually tenders an issue, as it is called; the language of which is different according to the party by whom it is tendered: for if the traverse or denial comes from the defendant, the issue is tendered in this manner, \"And of this he puts himself upon the country,\" thereby submitting himself to the judgement of his peers: but if the traverse lies upon the plaintiff, he tenders the issue or prays the judgement of the peers against the defendant in another form; thus, \"and this he prays may be inquired of by the country.\"\n\nBut if either side (as, for instance, the defendant) pleads a special negative plea, not traversing or denying anything that was before alleged, but disclosing some new negative matter; as where the suit is on a bond conditioned to perform an award, and the defendant pleads, negatively, that no award was made; he tenders no issue upon this plea, because it does not yet appear whether...\nPLE\n\nPleadings, whether the fact will be disputed, the plaintiff not having yet asserted the existence of any award; but when the plaintiff replies, and seeks forth an actual specific award, if then the defendant traverses the replication, and denies the making of any such award, he then, and not before, tenders an issue to the plaintiff. For when in the course of pleading they come to a point which is affirmed on one side and denied on the other, they are then said to be at issue; all their debates being at last contracted into a single point, which must now be determined either in favour of the plaintiff or of the defendant. See Issue.","sp":267,"ep":270},{"h":"PLEASING","t":"art of. See Politeness.\n\nPLEASURE is a word so universally understood as to need no explanation. Lexicographers, however, who must attempt to explain every word, call it \"the gratification of the mind or senses.\" It is directly opposite to PAIN, and constitutes the whole of positive happiness, as that does of misery.\n\nThe Author of Nature has furnished us with many pleasures, as well as made us liable to many pains; and we are susceptible of both in some degree as soon as we have life and are endowed with the faculty of sensation. A French writer, in a work* which once raised high expectations, contends, that a child in the womb of its mother feels neither pleasure nor pain. \"These sensations (says he) are not innate; they have their origin from without; and it is at the moment of our birth that the soul receives its first impressions; impressions slight and superficial at the beginning, but which by time and repeated acts leave deeper traces in the sensorium, and become more extensive and more lasting. It is when the child emits forth its first cries that sensibility or the faculty of sensation is produced, which in a short time gathers strength and stability by the impression of external objects. Pleasure and pain not being innate, and being only acquired in the same manner as the qualities which we derive from instruction, education, and society, it follows that we learn to suffer and enjoy as we learn any other science.\"\n\nThis is strange reasoning and strange language. That sensations are not innate is universally acknowledged; but it does not therefore follow that the soul receives its first impressions and first sensations at the moment of birth. The child has life, the power of locomotion, and the sense of touch, long before it is born; and every mother will tell this philosopher, that an infant unborn exhibits symptoms both of pain and of pleasure. That many of our organs of sense are improved by use is incontrovertible; but it is so far from being true that our sensible pleasures become more exquisite by being often repeated, that the direct contrary is experienced of far the greater part of them; and though external objects, by making repeated impressions on the senses, certainly leave deeper traces on the memory than an object once perceived can do, it by no means follows that these impressions become the more delightful the more familiar that they are to us. That we learn to suffer and enjoy as we learn any other science, is a most extravagant paradox; for it is self-evident that we cannot live without being capable in some degree both of suffering and enjoyment, though a man may certainly live to old age in profound ignorance of all the sciences.\n\nThe same writer assures us, indeed, that sensation is not necessary to human life. \"Philosophers (says he) make mention of a man who had lost every kind of feeling in every member of his body: he was pinched or pricked to no purpose. Meanwhile this man made use of all his members; he walked without pain, he drank, ate, and slept, without perceiving that he did so. Sensible neither to pleasure nor pain, he was a true natural machine.\"\n\nTo the tale of these anonymous philosophers our author gives implicit credit, whilst he favours us at the same instant with the following argumentation, which completely proves its falsehood. \"It is true that sensation is a relative quality, susceptible of increase and diminution; that it is not necessary to existence; and that one might live without it: but in this case he would live as an automaton, without feeling pleasure or pain; and he would possess neither idea, nor reflection, nor desire, nor passion, nor will, nor sentiment; his existence would be merely passive, he would live without knowing it, and die without apprehension.\"\n\nBut if this man of the philosophers, whom our author calls an automaton, and a true natural machine, had neither idea, nor desire, nor passion, nor will, nor sentiment (and without sensation he certainly could have none of them), what induced him to walk, eat, or drink, or to cease from any of these operations after they were accidentally begun? The instances of the automata which played on the flute and at chefs are not to the purpose for which they are adduced; for there is no parallel between them and this natural machine, unless the philosophers wound up their man to eat, drink, walk, or sit, as Vacanson and Kempeler wound up their automata to play or cease from playing on the German flute and at chefs. See ANDROIDES.\n\nOur author having for a while sported with these harmless paradoxes, proceeds to put the credulity of his reader to the test with others of a very contrary tendency. He institutes an inquiry concerning the superiority, in number, and degree, of the pleasures enjoyed by the different orders of men in society; and labours, not indeed by argument, but by loose declamation, to propagate the belief that happiness is very unequally distributed. The pleasures of the rich, he says, must be more numerous and exquisite than those of the poor; the nobleman must have more enjoyments than the plebeian of equal wealth; and the king, according to him, must be the happiest of all men. He owns, indeed, that although \"birth, rank, honours, and dignity, add to happiness, a man is not to be considered as miserable because he is born in the lower conditions of life. A man may be happy as a mechanic, a merchant, or a labourer, provided he enters into the spirit of his profession, and has not imbibed by a misplaced education those sentiments which make his condition insupportable. Happiness is of easy acquisition in the middling stations of life; and though perhaps we are unable to know or to rate exactly the pleasure which arises from contentment and mediocrity, yet happiness being a kind of aggregate of delights, of riches, and of advantages more or less great, every person must have a share of it; the division is not exactly made, but all other things equal, there will be more in the elevated than in the inferior conditions of society; the enjoyment will be more felt, the means of enjoying more multiplied, and the pleasures more varied. Birth, rank, fortune, talents, wit, genius,\nPleasure, genius, and virtue, are then the great sources of happiness; those advantages are so considerable, that we see men contented with any one of them, but their union forms supreme felicity.\n\n\"There is so vast a difference,\" says Voltaire, \"between a man who has made his fortune and one who has to make it, that they are scarcely to be considered as creatures of the same kind. The same thing may be said of birth, the greatest of all advantages in a large society; of rank, of honours, and of great abilities. How great a difference is made between a person of high birth and a tradesman; between a Newton or Descartes and a simple mathematician? Ten thousand soldiers are killed on the field of battle, and it is scarcely mentioned; but if the general fall, and especially if he be a man of courage and abilities, the court and city are filled with the news of his death, and the mourning is universal.\n\n\"Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, felt in a more lively manner than perhaps any other man the value of great talents. I would willingly renounce,\" said he to Voltaire, \"everything which is an object of desire and ambition to man; but I am certain if I were not a prince I should be nothing. Your merit alone would gain you the esteem and envy, and admiration of the world; but to secure respect for me, titles, and armies, and revenues, are absolutely necessary.\"\n\nFor what purpose this account of human happiness was published, it becomes not us to say. Its obvious tendency is to make the lower orders of society discontented with their state, and envious of their superiors; and it is not unreasonable to suppose, that it contributed in some degree to excite the ignorant part of the author's countrymen to the commission of those atrocities of which they have since been guilty. That such was his intention, the following extract will not permit us to believe; for though in it the author attempts to support the same false theory of human happiness, he mentions virtuous kings with the respect becoming a loyal subject of the unfortunate Louis, whose character he seems to have intentionally drawn, and whose death by the authority of a savage faction he has in effect foretold.\n\n\"Happiness, in a state of society, takes the most variable forms: it is a Proteus susceptible of every kind of metamorphosis; it is different in different men, in different ages, and in different conditions, &c. The pleasures of youth are very different from those of old age: what affords enjoyment to a mechanic would be supreme misery to a nobleman; and the amusements of the country would appear insipid in the capital. Is there then nothing fixed with regard to happiness? Is it of all things the most variable and the most arbitrary? Or, in judging of it, is it impossible to find a standard by which we can determine the limits of the greatest good to which man can arrive in the present state? It is evident that men form the same ideas of the beautiful and sublime in nature, and of right and wrong in morality, provided they have arrived at that degree of improvement and civilization of which human nature is susceptible; and that different opinions on these subjects depend on different degrees of culture, of education, and of improvement. The same thing may be advanced with regard to happiness: all men, if equal with respect to their organs, would form the very same ideas on this subject if they reached the degree of improvement of which we are presently speaking; and in fact, do we not see in the great circles at Rome, at Vienna, at London, and Paris, that those who are called people of fashion, who have received the same education, have nearly the same taste, the same desires, and the same spirit for enjoyment? there is doubtless a certain degree of happiness to be enjoyed in every condition of life; but as there are some conditions preferable to others, so are there degrees of happiness greater and less; and if we were to form an idea of the greatest possible in the present state, it perhaps would be that of a sovereign, master of a great empire, enjoying good health and a moderate spirit; endowed with piety and virtue; whose whole life was employed in acts of justice and mercy, and who governed by fixed and unmovable laws. Such a king is the image of the divinity on earth, and he must be the idol of a wise people. His whole life should present a picture of the most august felicity. Although such sovereigns are rare, yet we are not without examples of them. Ancient history affords us Titus and Marcus Aurelius, and the present age can boast of piety and munificence in the character of some of its kings. This state of the greatest happiness to which man can reach not being ideal, it will serve as a standard of comparison by which happiness and misery can be estimated in all civilized countries. He is as happy as a king, is a proverbial expression, because we believe with justice that royalty is the extreme limit of the greatest enjoyments; and in fact, happiness being the work of man, that condition which comprehends all the degrees of power and of glory, which is the source of honour and of dignity, and which supposes in the person invested with all means of enjoyment either for himself or others, leaves nothing on this earth to which any reasonable man would give the preference.\n\n\"We can find also in this high rank the extreme of the greatest evils to which the condition of nature is exposed. A king condemned to death and perishing on a scaffold, by the authority of a faction, while at the same time he had endeavoured by every means in his power to promote the general happiness of his subjects, is the most terrible and striking example of human misery; for if it be true that a crown is the greatest of all blessings, then the loss of it, and at the same time the loss of life by an ignominious and unjust sentence, are of all calamities the most dreadful.\n\n\"It is also in the courts of kings that we find the most amiable and perfect characters; and it is there where true grandeur, true politeness, the best tone of manners, the most amiable graces, and the most eminent virtues, are completely established. It is in courts that men seem to have acquired their greatest improvement: Whoever has seen a court, says La Bruyere, has seen the world in the most beautiful, the most enchanting, and attractive colours. The prejudices of mankind in behalf of the great are so extensive, that if they inclined to be good they would be almost the objects of adoration.\"\n\nIn this passage there are doubtless many just observations; but there is at least an equal number of others both false and dangerous. That a crown is the greatest of earthly blessings, and that it is in the courts of kings that we meet with the most amiable and perfect characters, are positions which a true philosopher will not admit but with great limitations. The falsehood of the author's\npleasure. But all pains do not proceed from an excess of action. Many of them arise from reducing the body or the mind to a state below indifference. Thus, if a person have just sufficient warmth in his body to keep him barely at ease or in a state of indifference, by withdrawing this heat a state of uneasiness or pain is produced; and if in a calm state of mind one be made acquainted with a melancholy event, his quiet is interrupted, and he sinks below indifference into a painful state of mind. If now, without communicating any new source of positive pleasure, we remove in the former case the cold, and in the latter the grief, the persons from whom they are removed will experience real pleasure. Thus, then, whether pain arises from excess or deficiency of action, the gradual or the sudden removal of it must be in all cases attended with pleasure.* It is equally true that the gradual or sudden removal of pleasure is attended with pain.\n\nWe are now prepared to examine our French author's account of the pleasures and pains of savages. \"Every age (says he) has its different pleasures; but if we were to imagine that those of childhood are equal to those of confirmed age, we should be much mistaken in our estimation of happiness. The pleasures of philosophy, either natural or moral, are not unfolded to the infant; the most perfect music is a vain noise; the most exquisite perfumes and dishes highly seasoned offend his young organs instead of affording delight; his touch is imperfect; forty days elapse before the child gives any sign of laughter or of weeping; his cries and groans before that period are not accompanied with tears; his countenance expresses no passion; the parts of his face bear no relation to the sentiments of the soul, and are moreover without constancy. Children are but little affected with cold; whether it be that they feel less, or that the interior heat is greater than in adults. In them all the impressions of pleasure and pain are transitory; their memory has scarcely begun to unfold its powers; they enjoy nothing but the present moment; they weep, laugh, and give tones of satisfaction without consciousness, or at least without reflection; their joy is confined to the indulgence of their little whims, and constraint is the greatest of their misfortunes; few things amuse, and nothing satisfies them. In this happy condition of early infancy nature is at the whole expense of happiness; and the only point is not to contradict her. What desires have children? Give them liberty in all their movements, and they have a plenitude of existence, an abundance of that kind of happiness which is confined in some sort to all the objects which surround them: but if all beings were happy on the same conditions, society would be at no expense in procuring the happiness of the different individuals who compose it. Sensation is the foundation of reflection; it is the principal attribute of the soul; it is by this that man is elevated to sublime speculations, and secures his dominion over nature and himself. This quality is not stationary, but susceptible, like all other relative qualities, of increase and decay, of different degrees of strength and intensity: it is different in different men; and in the same man it increases from infancy to youth, from youth to confirmed manhood: at this period it stops, and gradually declines as we proceed to old age and to second childhoods. Considered physically, it varies according to age, constitution, climate, and food; considered in a moral point of view, it...\nPleasure of view, it takes its different appearances from individual education, and from the habits of society; for man in a state of nature and society, with regard to sensation and the unfolding of his powers, may be considered as two distinct beings: and if one were to make a calculation of pleasure in the course of human life, a man of fortune and capacity enjoys more than ten thousand savages.\n\n\"Pleasure and pain being relative qualities, they may be almost annihilated in the moment of vehement passion. In the heat of battle, for example, ardent and animated spirits have not felt the pain of their wounds; and minds strongly penetrated with sentiments of religion, enthusiasm, and humanity, have supported the most cruel torments with courage and fortitude. The sensibility of some persons is so exquisitely alive, that one can scarcely approach them without throwing them into convulsions. Many diseases show the effect of sensibility pushed to an extreme; such as hysterical affections, certain kinds of madness, and some of those which proceed from poison, and from the bite or sting of certain animals, as the viper and the tarantula. Excessive joy or grief, fear and terror, have been known to destroy all sensation, and occasion death.\"\n\nHaving made these preliminary observations on pleasure and pain in infancy, and as they are increased or diminished by education, and the different conditions of body and mind, our author proceeds to consider the capability of savages to feel pleasure and pain. \"By savages he understands all the tribes of men who live by hunting and fishing, and on those things which the earth yields without cultivation. Those tribes who possess herds of cattle, and who derive their subsistence from such possessions, are not to be considered as savages, as they have some idea of property. Some savages are naturally compassionate and humane, others are cruel and sanguinary. Although the physical constitution of man be everywhere the same, yet the varieties of climate, the abundance or scarcity of natural productions, have a powerful influence to determine the inclinations. Even the fierceness of the tiger is softened under a mild sky; now nature forms the manners of savages just as society and civil institutions form the manners of civilized life. In the one case climate and food produce almost the whole effect; in the other they have scarcely any influence. The habits of society every moment contend with nature, and they are almost always victorious. The savage devotes himself to the dominion of his passions; the civilized man is employed in restraining, in directing, and in modifying them: so much influence have government, laws, society, and the fear of censure and punishment, over his soul.\n\n\"It is not to be doubted that savages are susceptible of both pleasure and pain; but are the impressions made on their organs as sensible, or do they feel pain in the same degree with the inhabitants of a civilized country?\n\n\"Their enjoyments are so limited, that if we confine ourselves to truth, a few lines will be sufficient to describe them: our attention must therefore be confined to pain, because the manner in which they support misfortune, and even torture, presents us with a view of character unequalled in the history of civilized nations. It is not uncommon in civilized countries to see men bearing death, meeting it with cheerfulness, and even not uttering complaints under the torture; but they do not infuse the executioners of public vengeance, and defy pain in order to augment their torments; and those who are condemned by the laws suffer the punishment with different degrees of fortitude. On those mournful occasions, the common ranks of mankind in general die with less firmness: those, on the other hand, who have received education, and who, by a train of unfortunate events, are brought to the scaffold, whether it be the fear of being reproached with cowardice, or the consideration that the stroke is inevitable, such men discover the expiring sighs of self-love even in their last moments; and those especially of high rank, from their manners and sentiments, are expected to meet death with magnanimity: but an American savage in the moment of punishment appears to be more than human; he is a hero of the first order, who braves his tormentors, who provokes them to employ all their art, and who considers as his chief glory to bear the greatest degree of pain without shrinking (see AMERICA, No. 14, 27, 28, 29.). The recital of their tortures would appear exaggerated, if it were not attested by the best authority, and if the savage nations among whom those customs are established were not sufficiently known; but the excess of the cruelty is not so astonishing as the courage of the victim. The European exposed to sufferings of the same dreadful nature would rend heaven and earth with his piercing cries and horrible groans; the reward of martyrdom, the prospect of eternal life, could alone give him fortitude to endure such torments; but the savage is not animated with this exalted hope. What supports him then in scenes of so exquisite suffering? The feeling of shame, the fear of bringing reproach on his tribe, and giving a stain to his fellows never to be wiped away, are the only sentiments which influence the mind of a savage, and which always present to his imagination, animate him, support him, and lend him spirit and resolution. At the same time, however powerful those motives may be, they would not be alone sufficient, if\n\n(a) There are instances of persons who have died at the noise of thunder without being touched. A man frightened with the fall of a gallery in which he happened to be, was immediately seized with the black jaundice. M. le Cat mentions a young person on whom the influence of another made such an impression, that his countenance became at first yellow, and then changed into black, in such a manner that in less than eight days he appeared to wear a mask of black velvet: he continued in this state for four months, without any other symptom of bad health or any pain. A sailor was so terrified in a storm, that his face sweated blood, which like ordinary sweat returned as it was wiped off. Stahl, whose testimony cannot be called in question, cites a similar case of a girl who had been frightened with soldiers. The excess of fear, according to many physicians, produces madness and epilepsy.\nPleasure, the savage felt pain in the same degree with the European. Sensibility, as we have already observed, is increased by education; it is influenced by society, manners, laws, and government; climate and food work it into a hundred different shapes; and all the physical and moral causes contribute to increase and diminish it. The habitual existence of a savage would be a state of suffering to an inhabitant of Europe. You must cut the flesh of the one and tear it away with your nails, before you can make him feel in an equal degree to a scratch or prick of a needle in the other. The savage, doubting, suffers under torture, but he suffers much less than an European in the same circumstances: the reason is obvious; the air which the savages breathe is loaded with fog and moist vapours; their rivers not being confined by high banks, are by the winds as well as in floods spread over the level fields, and deposit on them a putrid and pernicious slime; the trees squeezed one upon another, in that rude and uncultivated country serve rather as a covering to the earth than an ornament. Instead of those fresh and delicious shades, those openings in the woods, and walks crossing each other in all directions, which delight the traveller in the fine forests of France and Germany; those in America serve only to intercept the rays of the sun, and to prevent the benign influence of his beams. The savage participates of this cold humidity; his blood has little heat, his humours are grofs, and his constitution phlegmatic. To the powerful influence of climate, it is necessary to join the habits of his life. Obliged to traverse vast deserts for subsistence, his body is accustomed to fatigue; food not nourishing, and at the same time in no great plenty, blunts his feelings; and all the hardships of the savage state give a rigidity to his members which makes him almost incapable of suffering. The savage in this state of nature may be compared to our water-women and street-porters, who, though they possess neither great vigour nor strength, are capable of performing daily, and without complaint, that kind of labour which to a man in a different condition of life would be a painful and grievous burden. Feeling, in less perfection with the savage, by the effects of climate and food, and the habits of his life, is still farther restrained by moral considerations. The European is less a man of nature than of society: moral restraints are powerful with him; while over the American they have scarcely any influence. This latter then is in a double condition of imperfection with regard to us; his senses are blunted, and his moral powers are not disclosed. Now, pleasure and pain depending on the perfection of the senses and the unfolding of the intellectual faculties, it cannot be doubted, that in enjoyments of any kind savages experience less pleasure, and in their sufferings less pain, than Europeans in the same circumstances. And in fact, the savages of America possess a very feeble constitution. They are agile without being strong; and this agility depends more on their habits than on the perfection of their members: they owe it to the necessity of hunting; and they are moreover so weak, that they were unable to bear the toil which their first oppressors imposed on them. Hence a race of men in all respects imperfect could not endure torment under which the most robust European would sink, if the pain which they feel were really as great as it appears to be. Feeling is then, and must necessarily be, less in the savage condition; for pleasure, this faculty disclosing itself by the exercise of all the physical and moral qualities, must be less as they are less exercised. Everything shows the imperfection of this precious quality, this source of all our affections, in the American savages.\n\n\"All the improvements in Europe have had a tendency to unfold sensibility: the air is purified that we may breathe more freely; the morals are drained, the rivers are regulated in their courses, the food is nourishing, and the houses commodious. With the savages, on the contrary, every thing tends to curb it; they take pleasure even in hardening the organs of the body, in accustoming themselves to bear by degrees the most acute pain without complaining. Boys and girls among the savages amuse themselves with tying their naked arms together, and laying a kindled coal between them, to try which of them can longest suffer the heat; and the warriors who aspire to the honour of being chief, undergo a course of suffering which exceeds the idea of torture inflicted on the greatest criminals in Europe.\"\n\nThese observations on the pleasures and pains of savages appear to be well-founded, and, as the attentive reader will perceive, are perfectly agreeable to the theory of Dr Sayers. If indeed that theory be just, as we believe it to be, it will follow, that the few pleasures of sense which the American enjoys, he ought to enjoy more completely than any European, because to him they recur but seldom. This may very possibly be the case; and certainly would be so, were not his fibres, by climate and the habits of his life, rendered more rigid than those of the civilized part of the inhabitants of Europe. But if we agree with our author * in what he says of the pains and pleasures of savages, we cannot admit, without many exceptions, his theory of the enjoyments of children. It is so far from being true, that few things amuse, and that nothing satisfies them, that the direct contrary must have been observed by every man attentive to the operations of the infant mind, which is amused with everything new, and often completely satisfied with the merest trifle. The pleasures of philosophy are not indeed unfolded to the infant; but it by no means follows that he does not enjoy his rattle and his drum as much as the philosopher enjoys his telescope and air-pump; and if there be any truth in the science of physiognomy, the happiness of the former is much more pure and exquisite than that of the latter. That the most perfect music is vain noise to an infant, is far from being self-evident, unless the author confines the state of infancy to a very few months; and we are not disposed to believe, without better proof than we have yet received, that the relish of exquisite perfumes and highly-scented dishes adds much to the sum of human felicity.\n\nBut however much we disapprove of many of these reflections, the following we cordially adopt as our own.\n\n\"If we compare (says our author) the pleasures of sense with those which are purely intellectual, we shall find that the latter are infinitely superior to the former, as they may be enjoyed at all times and in every situation of life. What are the pleasures of the table, says Cicero, of gaming, and of women, compared with the delights of study? This taste increases with age, and no happiness...\nPleasure, happiness is equal to it. Without knowledge and study, say Cato, life is almost the image of death (9). The pleasures of the soul are such, that it is frequent enough to see men preserve their gaiety during their whole life, notwithstanding a weak, defeated, and debilitated body. Scaron, who lived in the last century, was an example of this. Balzac, speaking of him, says, that Prometheus, Hercules, and Philocetes, in profane, and Job in sacred history, said many great things while they were afflicted with violent pain; but Scaron alone said pleasant things. I have seen, continues he, in many places of ancient history, constancy, and modesty, and wisdom, and eloquence, accompanying affliction; but he is the only instance wherein I have seen pleasantry.\n\nThere are men whose understandings are constantly on the stretch, and by this very means they are improved; but if the body were as constantly employed in the pursuit of sensual gratification, the constitution would soon be destroyed. The more we employ the mind we are capable of the greater exertion; but the more we employ the body we require the greater repose. There are besides but some parts of the body capable of enjoying pleasure; every part of it can experience pain. A toothache occasions more suffering than the most considerable of our pleasures can procure of enjoyment. Great pain may continue for any length of time; excessive pleasures are almost momentary. Pleasure carried to an extreme becomes painful; but pain, either by augmenting or diminishing it, never becomes agreeable. For the moment, the pleasures of the senses are perhaps more satisfactory; but in point of duration those of the heart and mind are infinitely preferable. All the sentiments of tenderness, of friendship, of gratitude, and of generosity, are sources of enjoyment for man in a state of civilization. The damned are exceedingly unhappy, said St Catherine de Sienna, if they are incapable of loving or being beloved.\n\nPleasure, continued for a great length of time, produces languor and fatigue, and excites sleep; the continuation of pain is productive of none of these effects. Many suffer pain for eight days and even a month without interruption; an equal duration of excessive pleasure would occasion death.\n\nTime is a mere relative idea with regard to pleasure and pain; it appears long when we suffer, and short when we enjoy. If there existed no regular and uniform movement in nature, we would not be able from our sensations alone to measure time with any degree of exactness, for pain lengthens and pleasure abridges it. From the languor of unoccupied time has arisen the proverb expressive of our desire to kill it. It is a melancholy reflection, and at the same time true, that there is no enjoyment which can effectually secure us from pain for the remainder of our lives; while there are examples of evils which hold men in constant sorrow and pain during their whole existence. Such then is the imperfection of the one and the power of the other.\n\nPleasure and pain are the sources of morality; an action is just or unjust, good or otherwise, only as its natural tendency is to produce suffering or enjoyment to mankind. No crime could be committed against a being altogether indefensible, nor could any good be bestowed on it. Unless he were endowed with the desire of pleasure and the apprehension of pain, man, like an automaton, would act from necessity, without choice and without determination.\n\nAll our passions are the development of sensibility. If we were not possessed of feeling, we should be destitute of passions; and as sensibility is augmented by civilization, the passions are multiplied; more active and vigorous in an extensive and civilized empire than in a small state; more in the latter than among barbarous nations; and more in these last than among savages (see Passion). There are more passions in France and England than in all the nations of Europe; because every thing which serves to excite and foster them is always in those countries in the greatest state of fermentation. The mind is active; the ideas great, extensive, and multiplied. And is it not the soul, the mind, and heart, which are the focus of all the passions?\n\nBut wherever the passions are multiplied, the sources of pleasure and pain are multiplied with them. This being the case, it is impossible to prescribe a fixed and general rule of happiness suited to every individual. There are objects of pleasure with regard to which all men of a certain education are agreed; but there are perhaps many more, owing to the variety of temperaments and education, about which they differ. Every man forms ideas of enjoyment relative to his character; and what pleases one may be utterly detested by another. In proportion as a nation is civilized and extensive, those differences are remarkable. Savages, who are not acquainted with all the variety of European pleasures, amuse themselves with very few objects. Owing to the want of civilization, they have scarcely any choice in the objects of taste. They have few passions; we have many. But even in the nations of Europe pleasure is infinitely varied in its modification and forms. Those differences arise from manners, from governments, from political and religious customs, and chiefly from education. Meanwhile, however different and variable the ideas of pleasure may be among nations and individuals, it still remains a fact, that a certain number of persons in all civilized states, whether distinguished by birth, rank, or fortune, or talents, as they have nearly the same education so they form nearly the same ideas of happiness; but to possess it a man must give his chief application to the state of his mind; and notwithstanding all his efforts it is of uncertain duration. Happiness is the function of life: we enjoy it frequently at great intervals; and it is therefore necessary to know how to use\n\n(B) \"Savages, barbarians, and peasants, enjoy little happiness except that of sensation, The happiness of a civilized and well-informed man consists of sensations, of ideas, and of a great number of affinities, altogether unknown to them. He not only enjoys the present, but the past and the future. He recalls the agreeable idea of pleasures which he has tasted. It is great happiness, says an ancient, to have the recollection of good actions, of an upright intention, and of promises which we have kept.\"\nPLE\n\nPleasure. All the productions of art perish; the largest fortunes are dissipated; rank, honour, and dignity pass away like a fleeting shadow; the memory is impaired; all the faculties of the soul are extinguished; the body sinks under the infirmities of old age; and scarcely has one reached the boundaries of happiness marked out by his imagination, when he must give place to another, and renounce all his pleasures, all his hopes, all his illusions; the fugitive images of which had given happiness to the mind.\n\nThere are pleasures, however, on which the mind may securely rest, which elevate man above himself, dignify his nature, fix his attention on spiritual things, and render him worthy of the care of Providence. These are to be found in true religion; which procures for those who practise its duties ineffable happiness in a better country, and is in this world the support of the weak, and the sweet consolation of the unfortunate.","sp":270,"ep":276},{"h":"PLEBEIAN","t":"any person of the rank of the common people.

The distinction was made by Romulus the founder of the city; who confined all dignities, civil, military, and sacerdotal, to the rank of patricians. But to prevent the seditions which such a distinction might produce through the pride of the higher order and the envy of the lower, he endeavoured to engage them to one another by reciprocal ties and obligations. Every plebeian was allowed to choose, out of the body of the patricians, a protector, who should be obliged to assist him with his interest and substance, and to defend him from oppression. These protectors were called patrons; the protected, clients. It was the duty of the patron to draw up the contracts of the clients, to extricate them out of their difficulties and perplexities, and to guard their ignorance against the artifices of the crafty. On the other hand, if the patron was poor, his clients were obliged to contribute to the portions of his daughters, the payment of his debts, and the ransom of him and his children if they happened to be taken in war. The client and patron could neither accuse nor bear witness against each other; and if either of them was convicted of having violated this law, the crime was equal to that of treason, and any one might with impunity slay the offender as a victim devoted to Pluto and the infernal gods. For more than 600 years we find no dissensions or jealousies between the patrons and their clients; not even in the times of the republic, when the people frequently mutinied against the great and powerful.","sp":276,"ep":276},{"h":"PLECTRANTHUS","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the didynamia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 42nd order, Verticillatae.

See BOTANY. Such flowers, although the most delightful to the eye, are both vegetable monsters, and, according to the sexualists, vegetable eunuchs; the unnatural increase of the petals constituting the first; the consequent exclusion of the stamina or male organs, the latter. The following are well-known examples of flowers with more petals than one; ranunculus, anemone, marigold, columbine, fennel-flower, poppy, peony, pink, gillyflower, campion, viscous campion, lily, crown imperial, tulip, narcissus, rocket, mallow, Syrian mallow, apple, pear, peach, cherry, almond, myrtle, rose, and strawberry.\n\nFlowers with one petal are not so subject to fullness. The following, however, are instances: polyanthus, hyacinth, primrose, crocus, meadow-saffron, and thorn-apple; though Kramer has asserted that a full flower with one petal is a contradiction in terms. In flowers with one petal, the mode of luxuriance, or impletion, is by a multiplication of the divisions of the limb or upper part; in flowers with more petals than one, by a multiplication of the petals or nectarium.\n\nTo take a few examples. Columbine is rendered full\nin three different ways: 1. By the multiplication of its petals, and total exclusion of the nectaria; 2. By the multiplication of the nectaria, and exclusion of the petals; or, 3. By such an increase of the nectaria only as does not exclude the petals, between each of which are interjected three nectaria, placed one within another. Again, fennel-flower is rendered full by an increase of the nectaria only; narcissus, either by a multiplication of its cup and petals, or of its cup only; larkspur commonly by an increase of the petals and exclusion of the spur, which is its nectarium. In *Japonaria concava anglica*, the impletion is attended with the finger-like effect of incorporating the petals, and reducing their number from five to one; and in gilder-rofe, the luxuriance is effected by an increase both in magnitude and number of the circumference or margin of the head of flowers, in the plain, wheel-shaped, barren florets; and an exclusion of all the bell-shaped hermaphrodite florets of the centre or disk.\n\nHitherto we have treated of plenitude in simple flowers only: the instance just now adduced seems to connect the different modes of impletion in them and compound flowers. Before proceeding farther, however, it will not be improper to premise, that as a simple luxuriant flower is frequently, by beginners, mistaken for a compound flower in a natural state, such flowers may always be distinguished with certainty by this rule: That in simple flowers, however luxuriant, there is but one pistillum or female organ; whereas in compound flowers, each floret, or partial flower, is furnished with its own proper pistillum. Thus in hawk-weed, a compound flower, each flat or tongue-shaped floret in the aggregate has its five stamens and naked seed, which last is in effect its pistillum; whereas, in a luxuriant lychis, which is a simple flower, there is found only one pistillum or female organ common to the whole.\n\nIn a compound radiated flower, which generally consists of plain florets in the margin or radius, and tubular or hollow florets in the centre or disk, plenitude is effected either by an increase of the florets in the margin, and a total exclusion of those in the disk; which mode of luxuriance is termed *impletion by the radius*, and resembles what happens in the gilder-rofe: or by an elongation of the hollow florets in the centre, and a less profound division of their brims; which is termed *impletion by the disk*. In the first mode of luxuriance, the florets in the centre, which are always hermaphrodite or male, are entirely excluded; and in their place succeed florets similar in sex to those of the radius. Now as the florets in the margin of a radiated compound flower are found to be always either female, that is, furnished with the pistillum only; or neuter, that is, furnished with neither stamens nor pistillum; it is evident, that a radiated compound flower, filled by the radius, will either be entirely female, as in feverfew, daisy, and African marigold; or entirely neuter, as in sunflower, marigold, and centaury: hence it will always be easy to distinguish such a luxuriant flower from a compound flower with plain florets in a natural state; as these flowers are all hermaphrodite, that is, furnished with both stamens and pistillum. Thus the full flowers of African marigold have each floret furnished with the pistillum or female organ only: the natural flowers of dandelion, which, like the former, is composed of plain florets, are furnished with both stamens and pistillum.\n\nIn the second mode of luxuriance, termed *impletion by the disk*, the florets in the margin sometimes remain unchanged: but most commonly adopt the figure of those in the centre, without, however, suffering any alteration in point of sex; so that confusion is less to be apprehended from this mode of luxuriance than from the former; besides, the length to which the florets in the centre run out is of itself a sufficient distinction, and adapted to excite at once an idea of luxuriance. Daisy, feverfew, and African marigold, exhibit instances of this as well as of the former mode of impletion.\n\nIn luxuriant compound flowers with plain florets, the *semiflora* of Tournefort, the stigma or summit of the style in each floret is lengthened, and the seed-buds are enlarged and diverge; by which characters such flowers may always be distinguished from flowers of the same kind in a natural state. Scorzonera, nipple-wort, and goat's-beard, furnish frequent instances of the plenitude alluded to.\n\nLastly, the impletion of compound flowers with tubular or hollow florets, the *flocculus* of Tournefort, seems to observe the same rules as that of radiated flowers just delivered. In everlastings-flower, the *xeranthemum* of Linn\u00e6us, the impletion is finger-like, being effected by the enlargement and expansion of the inward chaffy scales of the calyx. These scales, which become coloured, are greatly augmented in length, so as to overtop the florets, which are scarce larger than those of the same flower in a natural state. The florets too in the margin, which in the natural flower are female, become, by luxuriance, barren; that is, are deprived of the pistillum; the style, which was very short, spreads, and is of the length of the chaffy scales; and its summits, formerly two in number, are metamorphosed into one.\n\nFull flowers are more easily referred to their respective genera in methods founded upon the calyx, as the flower-cup generally remains unaffected by this highest degree of luxuriance.","sp":276,"ep":277},{"h":"PLEONASM","t":"a figure in *Rhetoric*, whereby we use words seemingly superfluous, in order to express a thought with the greater energy; such as, \"I saw it with my own eyes,\" &c.

By one of the palaces that was a little distant from the town, and was not overwhelmed with it, one may judge of the rest. It was an out-house of the family of the Francken, and yet it may compare with many palaces in Italy. The voluptuousness of this place became very crying; and Madame de Salis told me that she heard her mother often relate some passages of a Protestant minister's sermons that preached in a little church there, who warned them often of the terrible judgements of God which were hanging over their heads, and which he believed would suddenly break out upon them.\n\n\"On the 25th of August 1618, an inhabitant came and told me to be gone, for he saw the mountains cleaving; but he was laughed at for his pains. He had a daughter whom he prevailed to leave all and go with him; but when she was safe out of town, she called to mind that she had not locked the door of a room in which she had some things of value, and so she went back to do that, and was buried with the rest; for at the hour of supper the hill fell down, and buried the town and all the inhabitants, to the number of 2200, so that not one person escaped. The fall of the mountains did so fill the channel of the river, that the first news of Chavennes had of it was by the failing of their river; for three or four hours there came not a drop of water, but the river wrought for itself a new course, and returned to them.\n\n\"I could hear no particular character of the man who escaped (continues the Bishop); so I must leave the secret reason of so singular a preservation to the great discovery, at the last day, of those steps of Divine Providence that are now to unaccountable. Some of the family of the Francken got some miners to work underground, to find out the wealth that was buried in their house; for, besides their plate and furniture, there was a great deal of cash and many jewels in the house. The miners pretended they could find nothing; but they went to their country of Tyrol and built fine houses, and a great wealth appeared, of which no other visible account could be given but this, that they had found some of that treasure.\"","sp":278,"ep":278},{"h":"PLEXUS","t":"among anatomists, a bundle of small vessels interwoven in the form of net-work; thus a congeries of vessels within the brain is called plexus choroides, reticularis, or retiformis.

See Medicine, No. 355. Mr Cox, who gives a short account of it, attempts likewise to give the physical causes of it. Many causes of this kind, he tells us, have been supposed to concur in rendering the plica more frequent in those regions than in other parts. It would be an endless work to enumerate the various conjectures with which each person has supported his favourite hypothesis.\u2014The most probable are those assigned by Dr Vicat: The first cause is the nature of the Polish air, which is rendered insalubrious by numerous woods and marshes, and occasionally derives an uncommon keenness even in the midst of summer from the position of the Carpathian mountains; for the southern and south-easterly winds, which usually convey warmth in other regions, are in these chilled in their passage over their snowy summits. The second is, unwholesome water; for although Poland is not deficient in good springs, yet the common people usually drink that which is nearest at hand, taken indiscriminately from rivers, lakes, and even stagnant pools. The third cause is the gross inattention of the natives to cleanliness; for experience shows, that those who are not negligent in their persons and habitations, are less liable to be afflicted with the plica than others who are deficient in that particular. Thus persons of higher rank are less subject to this disorder than those of inferior stations; the inhabitants of large towns than those of small villages; the free peasants than those in an absolute state of vassalage; the natives of Poland Proper than those of Lithuania. Whatever we may determine as to the possibility that all or any of these causes, by themselves, or in conjunction with others, originally produced the disorder; we may venture to assert, that they all, and particularly the last, assist its propagation, inflame its symptoms, and protract its cure.\n\nIn a word, the plica polonica appears to be a contagious distemper; which, like the leprosy, still prevails among a people ignorant in medicine, and inattentive to check its progress, but is rarely known in those countries where proper precautions are taken to prevent its spreading.","sp":278,"ep":278},{"h":"PLIMPTON","t":"a town of Devonshire, in England, seated on a branch of the river Plym, which had once a castle, now in ruins.

He bore arms in a distinguished post; was one of the college of augurs; became intendant of Spain; and was employed in several important affairs by Vespasian and Titus, who honoured him with their esteem. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which happened in the year 79, proved fatal to him. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, relates the circumstances of that dreadful eruption, and the death of his uncle, in a letter to Tacitus. Pliny the Elder wrote a Natural History in 37 books, which is still extant, and has had many editions; the most esteemed of which is that of Father Hardouin, printed at Paris in 1723, in two volumes folio.\n\n**PLINY the Younger,** nephew of the former, was born in the ninth year of Nero, and the 62d of Christ, at Novocomum, a town upon the lake Larius, near which he had several beautiful villas. C\u00e6cilius was the name of his father, and Plinius Secundus that of his mother's brother, who adopted him. He brought into the world with him fine parts and an elegant taste, which he did not fail to cultivate early; for, as he tells us himself, he wrote a Greek tragedy at 14 years of age. He lost his father when he was young; and had the famous Virginius for his tutor or guardian, whom he has set in a glorious light. He frequented the schools of the rhetoricians, and heard Quintilian; for whom he ever after entertained so high an esteem, that he bestowed a considerable portion upon his daughter at her marriage. He was in his 18th year when his uncle died; and it was then that he began to plead in the forum, which was the usual road to dignities. About a year after, he assumed the military character, and went into Syria with the commission of tribune: but this did not suit his taste any more than it had done Tully's; and therefore we find him returning after a campaign or two. He tells us, that in his passage homewards he was detained by contrary winds at the island Icaria, and how he employed himself in making verses: he enlarges in the same place upon his poetical exercises; yet poetry was not the shining part of his character any more than it had been of Tully's.\n\nUpon his return from Syria, he married a wife, and settled at Rome: it was in the reign of Domitian. During this most perilous time, he continued to plead in the forum, where he was not more distinguished by his uncommon abilities and eloquence, than by his great resolution and courage, which enabled him to speak boldly, when scarcely one else durst speak at all. On these accounts he was often singled out by the senate to defend the plundered provinces against their oppressive governors, and to manage other causes of a like important and dangerous nature. One of these was for the province of Batavia, in their prosecution of Baebius Maffa; in which he acquired so general an applause, that the emperor Nerva, then a private man, and in banishment at Tarentum, wrote to him a letter, in which he congratulated not only Pliny, but the age which had produced an example so much in the spirit of the ancients. Pliny relates this affair in a letter to Cornelius Tacitus; and he was so pleased with it himself, that he could not help entreating this friend to record it in his history. He entreats him, however, with infinitely more modesty than Tully had intreated Lucceius upon the same occasion; and though he might imitate Cicero in the request, as he professes to have constantly let that great man before him for a model, yet he took care not to transgress the bounds of decency in his manner of making it. He obtained the offices of quaestor and tribune, and luckily went unhurt through the reign of Domitian: there is, however, reason to suppose, if that emperor had not died just as he did, that Pliny would have shared the fate of many other great men; for he tells us himself, that his name was afterwards found in Domitian's tables, among the number of those who were destined to destruction.\n\nHe lost his wife in the beginning of Nerva's reign, and soon after married his beloved Calpurnia, of whom we read so much in his Epistles. He had not, however, any children by any of his wives: and hence we find him thanking Trajan for the *jus trium liberorum*, which he afterwards obtained of that emperor for his friend Suetonius Tranquillus. He hints also, in his letter of thanks to Trajan, than he had been twice married in the reign of Domitian. He was promoted to the consulship by Trajan in the year 100, when he was 38 years of age; and in this office pronounced that famous panegyric, which has ever since been admired, as well for the copiousness of the topics as the elegance of address. Then he was elected augur, and afterwards made proconsul of Bithynia; whence he wrote to Trajan that curious letter concerning the primitive Christians; which, with Trajan's receipt, is happily extant among his Epistles. Pliny's letter, as Mr McIlmoth observes in a note upon the passage, is esteemed as almost the only genuine monument of ecclesiastical antiquity relating to the times immediately succeeding the apostles, it being written at most not above 40 years after the death of St Paul. It was preserved by the Christians themselves, as a clear and unsuspicious evidence of the purity of their doctrines, and is frequently appealed to by the early writers of the church against the calumnies of their adversaries. It is not known what became of Pliny after his return from Bithynia; whether he lived at Rome, or what time he spent at his country houses. Antiquity is also silent as to the time of his death: but it is conjectured that he died either a little before or soon after that excellent prince, his admired Trajan; that is, about the year of Christ 116.\n\nPliny was one of the greatest wits, and one of the worthiest\nworthiest men among the ancients. He had five parts, which he cultivated to the utmost; and he accomplished himself with all the various kinds of knowledge which could serve to make him either useful or agreeable. He wrote and published a great number of things; but nothing has escaped the wreck of time except the books of Letters, and the panegyric upon Trajan. This has ever been considered as a masterpiece; and if he has, as some think, almost exhausted all the ideas of perfection in a prince, and gone perhaps a little beyond the truth, yet it is allowed that no panegyric was ever possessed of a finer subject, and on which he might better indulge in all the flow of eloquence, without incurring the suspicion of flattery and lies. His letters seem to have been intended for the public; and in them he may be considered as writing his own memoirs. Every epistle is a kind of historical sketch, wherein we have a view of him in some striking attitude either of active or contemplative life. In them are preserved anecdotes of many eminent persons, whose works have come down to us, as Suetonius, Silius Italicus, Martial, Tacitus, and Quintilian; and of curious things, which throw great light upon the history of those times. They are written with great politeness and spirit; and if they abound too much in turn and metaphor, we must impute it to that degeneracy of taste which was then accompanying the degenerate manners of Rome. Pliny, however, seems to have preserved himself in this latter respect from the general contagion: whatever the manners of the Romans were, his were pure and incorrupt. His writings breathe a spirit of transcendent goodness and humanity: his only imperfection is, he was too desirous that the public and posterity should know how humane and good he was. We have two elegant English translations of his Epistles; the one by Mr Mead, and the other by Lord Orrery.\n\nPLOCAM\u00c1, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra class.

In 1687 he was made secretary to the Earl Marshal, and the following year received the title of Historiographer to King James II. In 1690 he resigned his professorship of chemistry, and likewise his place of keeper of the museum, to which he presented a very large collection of natural curiosities; which were those he had described in his histories of Oxfordshire and Staffordshire: the former published at Oxford in 1677, folio, and reprinted with additions and corrections in 1705; and the latter was printed in the same size in 1686. In January 1694-5, Henry Howard, Earl Marshal, nominated him Maberay-herald extraordinary; two days after which he was constituted register of the court of honour; and, on the 30th of April 1696, he died of the stone at his house in Borden.\n\nAs Dr Plot delighted in natural history, the above works were designed as essays towards a Natural History of England; and he had actually formed a design of travelling through England and Wales for that purpose.

He was born at Lycompis, a city of Egypt, in 204; and began very early to show a great singularity both in his taste and manners: for, at eight years of age, when he went to school, he used to run to his nurse, and uncover her breast to suck; and would have continued that practice longer, if he had not been discouraged by her. At 28 years of age he had a strong desire to study philosophy, on which occasion he was recommended to the most famous professors of Alexandria. He was not satisfied with their lectures; but,\nPlotinus, upon hearing those of Ammonius, he confessed that this was the man he wanted. He studied for 11 years under that excellent master, and then went to hear the Persian and Indian philosophers: for in 243, when the emperor Gordianus intended to wage war against the Persians, he followed the Roman army, but probably repented of it; for it was with difficulty he could save his life by flight, after the emperor had been slain. He was then 39; and the year following he went to Rome, and read philosophical lectures in that city; but avoided following the example of Erennius and Origen, his fellow-pupils, who, having promised with him not to reveal some hidden and excellent doctrines they had received from Ammonius, had nevertheless forfeited their word. Plotinus continued ten years in Rome, without writing anything; but, in his 50th year, Porphyry became his scholar; who, being of an exquisitely fine genius, was not satisfied with superficial answers, but required to have all difficulties thoroughly explained; and therefore Plotinus, to treat things with greater accuracy, was obliged to write more books. He had before written 21 books, and during the six years of Porphyry's stay with him he wrote 24, and 9 after Porphyry's leaving Rome, in all 54. The Romans had a high veneration for him; and he passed for a man of such judgement and virtue, that many persons of both sexes, when they found themselves dying, intrusted him, as a kind of guardian angel, with the care of their estates and children. He was the arbiter of numberless law-suits; and constantly behaved with such humanity and rectitude of mind, that he did not create himself one enemy during the 26 years he resided in Rome. He, however, did not meet with the same justice from all of his own profession; for Olympias a philosopher of Alexandria, being envious of his glory, used his utmost endeavours, though in vain, to ruin him. The emperor Gallienus, and the empress Salonina, had a very high regard for him; and, had it not been for the opposition of some jealous courtiers, they would have had the city of Campania rebuilt, and given to him with the territory belonging to it, to establish a colony of philosophers, and to have it governed by the ideal laws of Plato's commonwealth. He laboured under various disorders during the last year of his life, which obliged him to leave Rome, when he was carried to Campania to the heirs of one of his friends, who furnished him with everything necessary; and he died there in the year 270, at the age of 66, and in the noblest manner that an heathen philosopher could do, these being his words as he breathed his last: \"I am labouring with all my might to return the divine part of me to the Divine Whole which fills the universe.\"\n\nWe have already remarked that the ideas of Plotinus were singular and extraordinary; and we shall now show that they were so. He was ashamed of being lodged in a body, for which reason he did not care to tell the place of his birth or family. The contempt he had for all earthly things, was the reason why he would not permit his picture to be drawn: and when his disciple Amelius was urgent with him upon this head, \"Is it not enough (said he) to drag after us, whithersoever we go, that image in which nature has shut us up? Do you think that we should likewise transmit to future ages an image of that image, as a sight worthy of their attention?\" From the same principle, he refused to attend to his health; for he never made use of preservatives or baths, and did not even eat the flesh of tame animals. He ate but little, and abstained very often from bread; which joined to his intense meditation, kept him very much from sleeping. In short, he thought the body altogether below his notice; and had so little respect for it, that he considered it as a prison, from which it would be his supreme happiness to be freed. When Amelius, after his death, inquired about the state of his soul of the oracle of Apollo, he was told, \"that it was gone to the assembly of the blessed, where charity, joy, and a love of the union with God prevail.\" And the reason given for it, as related by Porphyry, is, \"that Plotinus had been peaceable, gracious, and vigilant; that he had perpetually elevated his thoughts foul to God; that he had loved God with his whole heart; that he had disengaged himself, to the utmost of his abilities, from this wretched life; that, elevating himself with all the powers of his soul, and by the several gradations taught by Plato, towards that Supreme Being which fills the universe, he had been enlightened by him; had enjoyed the vision of him without the help or interposition of ideas; had, in short, been often united to him.\" This is the account of Porphyry, who tells us also, that he himself had once been favoured with the vision. To this account, however, we need scarcely add, that little credit is due: it agrees pretty much with modern enthusiasm and the reveries of Eckhaimists. Plotinus had also his familiar spirit, as well as Socrates; but, according to Porphyry, it was not one of those called demons, but of the order of those who are called gods; so that he was under the protection of a genius superior to that of other men. The superiority of his genius puffed him up not a little: for when Amelius desired him to share in the sacrifices, which he used to offer up on solemn festivals, \"It is their business (replied Plotinus) to come to me, not mine to go to them;\" \"which lofty answer (says Porphyry) no one could guess the reason of, or dared to ask.\"\n\nPorphyry put the 54 books of Plotinus in order, and divided them into five enneads. The greater part of them turn on the most high-flown ideas in metaphysics; and this philosopher seems, in certain points, not to differ much from Spinoza. He wrote two books to prove, that \"all being is one and the same;\" which is the very doctrine of Spinoza. He inquires, in another book, \"Whether there are many souls, or only one?\" His manner of composing partook of the singularity of his nature: he never read over his compositions after he had written them; he wrote a bad hand, and was not exact in his orthography: he stood in need, therefore, of a faithful friend to revise and correct his writings; and he chose Porphyry for this purpose before Amelius, who had, however, been his disciple 24 years, and was very much esteemed by him. Some have accused Plotinus of plagiarism, with regard to Numenius; a slander which Amelius refuted. Longinus was once much prejudiced against our great philosopher, and wrote against his Treatise of Ideas, and against Porphyry's answer in defence of that treatise. He afterwards conceived a high esteem for him; fought industriously for all his books; and, in order to have them very correct, desired Porphyry to lend him his copy; but at the same time wrote to him in the following manner: \"I always observed to you, when we were together,\"\nPLU\n\nPlotius\n\nPluche.\n\ngether, when we were at a distance from one another, as well as when you lived at Tyre, that I did not comprehend many of the subjects treated of by Plotinus; but that I was extremely fond of his manner of writing, the variety of his knowledge, and the order and disposition of his questions, which are altogether philosophical.\" \"This fingle passage (says Bayle) flows the exalted genius, the exquisite discernment, and judicious penetration of Longinus. It cannot be denied, that most subjects which this philosopher examines are incomprehensible; nevertheless, we discover in his works a very elevated, fruitful, and capacious genius, and a close way of reasoning. Had Longinus been an injudicious critic, had he not possessed an exalted and beautiful genius, he would not have been so sensible of Plotinus's obscurity: for no person complains less of the obscurity of a book, than those whose thoughts are confused and undertaking is shallow.\" Marius Ficinus, at the request of Cosmo de Medicis, made a Latin version of the works of Plotinus, with a summary and analysis of each book; which was printed at Basil, first by himself, in 1559, and afterwards with the Greek in 1580, folio. His life was written by Porphyry, the most illustrious of his disciples.","sp":280,"ep":282},{"h":"PLOTUS","t":"or Darter, a genus of birds belonging to the order Anseres.

Histoire du Ciel, or History of the Heavens, in 2 vols in 12mo. In this performance we find two parts almost independent of one another. The first contains some learned inquiries into the origin of the poetic heavens. It is nearly a complete mythology, founded upon ideas which are new and ingenious. The second is the history of the opinions given by philosophers respecting the formation of the world. The author shows the insufficiency, the inconstancy, and uncertainty, of the most esteemed systems; and concludes with pointing out the excellence and sublime simplicity of the Mosaic account. Besides a noble and well-turned expression, we find in it an erudition which does not fatigue the mind. As to the foundation of the system explained in the first part, though it appears extremely plausible, we will not take upon us to say how far it is true: Voltaire called it Fable du Ciel, or a Fable of the Heavens. 3. De Linguarum artificio; a work which he translated with this title, La M\u00e9canique des Langues, in 12mo. In this treatise he proposes a short and easy method of learning languages, which is by the use of translations instead of themes or exercises; his reflections on that subject are judicious and well expressed. 4.

In 1749, Abb\u00e9 Pluche retired to Varenne St Maure, where he gave himself up entirely to devotion and study. Having become deaf that he could not hear without the help of a trumpet, the capital afforded him little entertainment. It was in this retreat that he died of an apoplexy on the 20th of November 1761, at the age of 73 years. He possessed those qualities which form the scholar, the honest man, and the Christian: temperate in his meals, true to his word, an affectionate parent, a sensible friend, and a humane philosopher; he gave lessons of virtue in his life as well as his writings. His submission to all the dogmas of religion was very great.\nSome Deists having been surprized that, in matters of faith, he should think and speak like the vulgar, his answer was, \"I glory in doing so: It is infinitely more rational to believe the word of God, than to follow the glimmering lights of a reason which is limited and subject to error.\"","sp":282,"ep":283},{"h":"PLUG","t":"certain pieces of timber, formed like the frustum of a cone, and used to stop the nausie-holes and the breaches made in the body of a ship by cannon-balls; the former of which are called haule-plugs, and the latter shot-plugs, which are formed of various sizes in proportion to the holes made by the different sizes of shot, which may penetrate the ship's sides or bottom in battle; accordingly they are always ready for this purpose.","sp":283,"ep":283},{"h":"PLUKENET","t":"Leonard, a physician who flourished in the reign of King Charles II. was one of the most excellent and laborious botanists of that or any other age.

But the chief article in plumbery is sheets and pipes of lead; and as these make the basis of the plumber's work, we shall here give the process of making them.\n\nIn casting sheet-lead, a table or mould is made use of, which consists of large pieces of wood well jointed, and bound with bars of iron at the ends; on the sides of which runs a frame consisting of a ledge or border of wood, three inches thick and four inches high from the mould, called the sharps: The ordinary width of the mould, within these sharps, is from four to five feet; and its length is 16, 17, or 18 feet. This should be something longer than the sheets are intended to be, in order that the end where the metal runs off from the mould may be cut off, because it is commonly thin or uneven, or ragged at the end. It must stand very even or level in breadth, and something falling from the end in which the metal is poured in, viz. about an inch or an inch and a half in the length of 16 or 17 feet or more, according to the thickness of the sheets wanted; for the thinner the sheet, the more declivity the mould should have. At the upper end of the mould stands the pan, which is a concave triangular prism, composed of two planks nailed together at right angles, and two triangular pieces fitted in between them at the ends. The length of this pan is the whole breadth of the mould in which the sheets are cast; it stands with its bottom, which is a sharp edge, on a form at the end of the mould, leaning with one side against it; and on the opposite side is a handle to lift it up by, to pour out the melted lead; and on that side of the pan next the mould are two iron hooks to take hold of the mould, and prevent the pan from slipping while the melted lead is pouring out of it into the mould. This pan is lined on the inside with moistened sand, to prevent it from being fired by the hot metal. The mould is also spread over; about two inches thick, with sand fitted and moistened, which is rendered perfectly level by moving over it a piece of wood called a strike, and smoothing it over with a smoothing plane, which is a plate of polished brass, about one-fourth of an inch thick and nine inches square, turned up on all the four edges, and with a handle fitted on to the upper or concave side. The sand being thus smoothed, it is fit for casting sheets of lead; but if they would cast a cistern, they measure out the signs of the four sides; and having taken the dimensions of the front or fore-part, make mouldings by prefixing long slips of wood, which contain the same mouldings, into the level sand; and form the figures of birds, beasts, &c. by prefixing in the same manner leaden figures upon it, and then taking them off; and at the same time smoothing the surface where any of the sand is raised up by making these impressions upon it. The rest of the operation is the same in casting either cisterns or plain sheets of lead. But before we proceed to mention the manner in which that is performed, it will be necessary to give a more particular description of the strike. The strike, then, is a piece of board about five inches broad, and something longer than the breadth of the mould on the inside; and at each end is cut a notch about two inches deep, so that when it is used it rides upon the sharps with those notches. Before they begin to cast, the strike is made ready by tacking on two pieces of an old hat on the notches, or by flipping a case of leather over each end, in order to raise the under side about one-eighth of an inch or something more above the sand, according as they would have the sheet to be in thickness; then they tally the under edge of the strike, and lay it across the mould. The lead being melted, it is put into the pan with ladles, in which, when there is a sufficient quantity for the present purpose, the scum of the metal is swept off with a piece of board to the edge of the pan, letting it settle on the sand, which is by this means prevented from falling into the mould at the pouring out of the metal. When the lead is cool enough, which must be regulated according to the thickness of the sheets wanted, and is known by its beginning to stand with a shell or wall on the sand round the pan, two men take the pan by the handle, or else one of them lifts it by the bar and chain fixed to a beam in the ceiling, and pour it into the mould, while another man stands ready with the strike, and, as soon as they have done pouring in the metal, puts on the mould, sweeps the lead forward, and draws the overplus into a trough prepared to receive it. The sheets being thus cast, nothing remains but to roll them up or cut them into any measure wanted: but if it be a cistern, it is bent into four sides, so that the two ends may join the back, where they are soldered together; after which the bottom is soldered up.\n\nThe method of casting pipes without soldering.\u2014To make\nPlumbery make these pipes they have a kind of little mill, with arms or levers to turn it withal. The moulds are of braids, and consist of two pieces, which open and shut by means of hooks and hinges, their inward calibre or diameter being according to the size of the pipe, usually two feet and a half. In the middle is placed a core or round piece of braids or iron, somewhat longer than the mould, and of the thickness of the inward diameter of the pipe. This core is passed through two copper runnels, one at each end of the mould, which they serve to close; and to these is joined a little copper tube about two inches long, and of the thickness the leaden pipe is intended to be of. By means of these tubes, the core is retained in the middle of the cavity of the mould. The core being in the mould, with the runnels at its two ends, and the lead melted in the furnace, they take it up in a ladle, and pour it into the mould by a little aperture at one end, made in the form of a funnel. When the mould is full, they pass a hook into the end of the core, and, turning the mill, draw it out; and then opening the mould, take out the pipe. If they desire to have the pipe lengthened, they put one end of it in the lower end of the mould, and pass the end of the core into it; then shut the mould again, and apply its runnel and tube as before, the pipe just cast serving for a runnel, &c., at the other end. Things being thus replaced, they pour in fresh metal, and repeat the operation till they have got a pipe of the length required.\n\nFor making pipes of sheet-lead, the plumbers have wooden cylinders, of the length and thickness required; and on these they form their pipes by wrapping the sheet around them, and soldering up the edges all along them.\n\nThe lead which lines the Chinese tea-boxes is reduced to a thinness which we are informed European plumbers cannot imitate. The following account of the process by which the plates are formed was communicated to a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine by an intelligent officer of an East Indiaman. The cutter sits by a pot containing the melted metal; and has two large stones, the under one fixed, the upper moveable, directly before him. He raises the upper stone by pressing his foot upon the side of it, and with an iron ladle pours in the opening a proper quantity of the fluid metal. He then immediately lets fall the upper stone, and by that means forms the lead into a thin irregular plate, which is afterwards cut into a proper shape. The surfaces of the stones, where they touch each other, are exactly ground together.","sp":283,"ep":284},{"h":"PLUMBING","t":"among miners, is the method of using a mine-dial, in order to know the exact place of the work where to sink down an air-shaft, or to bring an adit to the work, or to know which way the load inclines when any flexure happens in it.\n\nIt is performed in this manner: A skilful person with an afflatus, and with pen, ink, and paper, and a long line, and a mine-dial, after his guess of the place above ground, descends into the adit or work, and there fastens one end of the line to some fixed thing in it; then the incited needle is let to rest, and the exact point where it rests is marked with a pen: he then goes on farther in, the line still fastened, and at the next flexure of the adit he makes a mark on the line by a knot or otherwise; and then letting down the dial again, he there likewise notes down that point at which the needle stands in this second position. In this manner he proceeds, from turning to turning, marking down the points, and marking the line, till he comes to the intended place: this done, he ascends and begins to work on the surface of the earth what he did in the adit, bringing the first knot in the line to such a place where the mark of the place of the needle will again answer its pointing, and continues this till he come to the desired place above ground, which is certain to be perpendicular over the part of the mine into which the air-shaft is to be sunk.","sp":284,"ep":284},{"h":"PLUMBUM","t":"Lead.** See **LEAD**, Chemistry Index.\n\n**PLUMBUM Corneum**, or muriate of lead, a combination of lead with muriatic acid.

See Benefice.\n\nThe finality of some benefices first gave rise to pluralities; for an ecclesiastic, unable to subsist on a single one, was allowed to hold two; and at length the number increased without bounds. A remedy was attempted for this abuse at the council of Lateran under Alexander III. and Innocent III. in the year 1215, when the holding more than one benefice was forbidden by a canon under the penalty of deprivation; but the same canon granting the pope a power to dispense with it in favour of persons of distinguished merit, the prohibition became almost useless. They were also restrained by statute 21 Hen. VIII. cap. 13, which enacted, that if any person having one benefice with cure of souls, of the yearly value of \u00a31, or above (in the king's books), accepts any other with cure of souls, the first shall be adjudged in law to be void, &c., though the same statute provides for dispensation in certain cases.\n\nIn England, in order to procure a dispensation, the prelate must obtain of the bishop, in whose diocese the livings are, two certificates of the values in the king's books, and the reputed values and distance; one for the archbishop, and the other for the lord-chancellor.

He must also show the archbishop his presentation to the second living; and bring with him two testimonials from the neighbouring clergy concerning his behaviour and conversation, one for the archbishop and the other for the lord-chancellor; and he must also show the archbishop his letters of orders, and a certificate of his having taken the degree of master of arts at the least, in one of the universities of this realm, under the hand of the registrar. And if he be not doctor or bachelor of divinity, nor doctor nor bachelor of law, he is to procure a qualification of a chaplain, which is to be duly registered in the faculty office, in order to be tendered to the archbishop, according to the statute. And if he hath taken any of the aforesaid degrees, which the statute allows as qualifications, he is to procure a certificate thereof as already mentioned, and to show the same to the archbishop; after which his dispensation is made out at the faculty office, where he gives security according to the direction of the canon.

Plutarch's family was ancient in Chaeronia; his grandfather Lamprias was eminent for his learning and a philosopher; and is often mentioned by Plutarch in his writings, as is also his father. Plutarch was initiated early in study, to which he was naturally inclined; and was placed under the care of Ammonius, an Egyptian, who, having taught philosophy with great reputation at Alexandria, from thence travelled into Greece, and settled at Athens. Under this master he made great advances in knowledge; and like a thorough philosopher, more apt to regard things than words, he purified this knowledge to the neglect of languages. The Roman language at that time was not only the language of Rome, but of Greece also: and much more used there than the French is now in England. Yet he was so far from regarding it then, that, as we learn from himself, he became not conversant in it till the declension of his life: and, though he is supposed to have resided in Rome near 40 years at different times, yet he never seems to have acquired a competent skill in it. But this was not the worst: he did not cultivate his mother-tongue with any great exactness; and hence that harshness, inequality and obscurity in his style, which has so frequently and justly been complained of.\n\nAfter he was principled and grounded by Ammonius, having an inextinguishable thirst for knowledge, he resolved to travel. Egypt was at that time, as formerly it had been, famous for learning; and probably the mysteries of their doctrine might tempt him, as it had tempted Pythagoras and others, to go and converse with the priesthood of that country. This appears to have been particularly his bent, by his travels Of Isis and Osiris: in which he shows himself versed in the ancient theology and philosophy of the wise men. From Egypt he returned into Greece; and visiting in his way all the academies and schools of the philosophers, gathered from them many of those observations with which he has abundantly enriched posterity. He does not seem to have been attached to any particular sect, but culled from each of them whatever he thought excellent and worthy to be regarded. He could not bear the paradoxes of the Stoics, but yet was more averse from the impiety of the Epicureans: in many things he followed Aristotle; but his favourites were Socrates and Plato, whose memory he revered to highly, that he annually celebrated their birth-days with much solemnity. Besides this, he applied himself with extreme diligence to collect not only all books that were excellent in their kind, but also all the sayings and observations of wise men which he had heard in conversation or had received from others by tradition; and likewise to consult...\nPlutarch fulf the records and public instruments preserved in cities which he had visited in his travels. He took a particular journey to Sparta, to search the archives of that famous commonwealth, to understand thoroughly the model of their ancient government, the history of their legislators, their kings, and their ephori; and digested all their memorable deeds and sayings with much care. He took the same methods with regard to many other commonwealths; and thus was enabled to leave us in his works such a rich cabinet of observation upon men and manners, as, in the opinion of Montaigne and Bayle, have rendered him the most valuable author of antiquity.\n\nThe circumstances of Plutarch's life are not known, and therefore cannot be related, with any exactness. According to the learned Fabricius, he was born under Claudius, 50 years after the Christian era. He was married to a most amiable woman of his own native town, whose name, according to the probable conjecture of Rualdus, was Timoxena, and to whose sense and virtue he has borne the most affectionate testimony in his moral works. He had several children, and among them two sons; one called Plutarch after himself, the other Lamprias in memory of his grandfather. Lamprias was he, of all his children, who seems to have inherited his father's philosophy; and to him we owe the table or catalogue of Plutarch's writings, and perhaps also his aphorisms. He had a nephew, Sextus Chaeronius, who taught the learned emperor Marcus Aurelius the Greek tongue, and was much honoured by him. Some think, that the critic Longinus was of his family; and Apuleius, in the first book of his Metamorphoses, affirms himself to be defended from him.\n\nOn what occasion, and at what time of his life, he went to Rome, how long he lived there, and when he finally returned to his own country, are all uncertain. It is probable, that the fame of him went thither before him, not only because he had published several of his works, but because immediately upon his arrival, as there is reason to believe, he had a great resort of the Roman nobility to hear him: for he tells us himself, that he was taken up in giving lectures of philosophy to the great men of Rome, that he had not time to make himself master of the Latin tongue, which is one of the first things that would naturally have engaged his attention. It appears that he was several times at Rome; and perhaps one motive for his living there was the intimacy he had contracted in some of these journeys with Soffius Senecio, a great and worthy man, who had been four times consul, and to whom Plutarch has dedicated many of his lives. But the great inducement which carried him first to Rome, was undoubtedly that which had carried him into so many other parts of the world; namely, to make observations upon men and manners, and to collect materials for writing the lives of the Roman worthies, in the same manner as he had already written those of the Grecian: and accordingly he not only conversed with all the living, but searched the records of the Capitol, and of all the libraries. Not but, as we learn from Suidas, he was instructed also with the management of public affairs in the empire, during his residence in the metropolis. \"Plutarch (says he) lived in the time of Trajan, who befriended him the consular ornaments, and also caused an edict to be passed, that the magistrates or officers of Illyria should do nothing in that province without his knowledge and approbation.\"\n\nWhen and how he was made known to Trajan is likewise uncertain: but it is generally supposed that Trajan, a private man when Plutarch first came to Rome, was, among other nobility, one of his auditors. It is also supposed, that this wise emperor made use of him in his councils; at least, much of the happiness of his reign has been imputed to Plutarch. Fabricius asserts that he was Trajan's preceptor, and that he was raised to the consular dignity by him, and made procurator of Greece in his old age by the emperor Adrian. We are equally at a loss concerning the time of his abode in the imperial city; which, however, at different times, is not imagined to fall much short of 40 years. The desire of visiting his native country, so natural to all men, and especially when growing old, prevailed with him at length to leave Italy: and at his return he was unanimously chosen archon or chief magistrate of Chaeronia, and not long after admitted into the number of the Delphic Apollo's priests. We have no particular account of his death, either as to the manner of it or the year; only it is evident that he lived, and continued his studies, to a good old age. The most probable conjecture is that of Fabricius, who says he died in the fifth year of Adrian, at the age of 70.\n\nHis works have been divided, and they admit of a pretty equal division, into Lives and Morals: the former of which, in his own estimation, were to be preferred as more noble than the latter. His style, as we have already observed, has been excepted to with some reason: he has also been criticised for some mistakes in Roman antiquities, and for a little partiality to the Greeks. On the other hand, he has been justly praised for the copiousness of his fine sense and learning, for his integrity, and for a certain air of goodness which appears in all he wrote. His bufnells was not to please the ear, but to instruct and charm the mind; and in this none ever went beyond him. Of his moral writings it is to be regretted that we have no elegant English translation. Even his Lives were chiefly known to the English reader by a motley and miserable version, till a new one executed with fidelity and spirit was presented to the public by the Langhorns in 1770. On the whole, it is to be wished that this most amiable moralist and biographer had added a life of himself to those which he has given to the world of others, as the particulars which other writers have preferred of his personal history are very doubtful and imperfect.","sp":285,"ep":286},{"h":"PLUTO","t":"in Pagan worship, the king of the infernal regions, was the son of Saturn and Ops, and the brother of Jupiter and Neptune.

See CERES and PROSERPINE.\n\nPluto is usually represented in an ebony chariot drawn by four black horses; sometimes holding a sceptre, to denote his power; at others, a wand, with which he drives away the ghosts; and at others, some keys, to signify that he had the keys of death.

From a mere fishing village it has become one of the largest towns in the county; and is one of the chief magazines in the kingdom, on account of its port, which is one of the safest in England, and which is so large as to be able to contain 1000 sail. It is defended by several different forts, mounting altogether nearly 300 guns; of which the chief is the Royal Citadel, erected in the reign of Charles II., opposite to St Nicholas island, which is within the circuit of its walls, and contains a large store-house and five regular bastions. In time of war the outward-bound convoys generally rendezvous at Plymouth, and homeward-bound ships generally put in to provide pilots up the Channel. It is also a great place of resort for men of war that are wind-bound.\n\nThe mouth of the Tamar is called Ham-Ooze, and that of Plym Catwater, which are both commanded by the castle on St Nicholas island. About two miles up the mouth of the Tamar there are four docks, two of which were built in the reign of William III., one wet and the other dry, and two which have been built since. They have every convenience for building or repairing ships. One of the docks is hewn out of a mine of slate, and lined with Portland stone. This town enjoys a pilchard fishery of considerable importance, and carries on an extensive trade with Newfoundland and the Straits, Plymouth. There is a customhouse in it; and though there are two churches (and besides several meeting-houses), yet each church has so large a cure of souls, that the parish clerks were till very lately in deacons orders, to enable them to perform all the occasional and other offices. The feet-rents are given to the poor. The lecturers are chosen every three years by the corporation, which was constituted by Henry VI., and consists of a mayor, 12 aldermen, and 24 common-council men. The mayor is elected by a jury of 36 persons, chosen by four others, two of whom are appointed by the mayor and aldermen, and the other two by the common-council. There is also a recorder, and a town-clerk, whose place is very profitable. The town consists of four divisions, which were anciently governed by four captains, each of whom had three constables under him. It is well supplied with fresh water, which was brought from the distance of seven miles, by Sir Francis Drake a native of the town. The toll of the markets, and of the cotton, yarn, &c. with the profit of the mill, which is very considerable, belongs to the corporation, as do the revenues of the shambles, which are farmed out for the mayor's kitchen. There is a charity-school in Plymouth, four hospitals, and a workhouse, in all which 100 poor children are clothed, fed, and taught; and there are two printing-houses. To one of the hospitals Colonel Jory gave a charity for 12 poor widows, as he did a mace worth \u00a320l. to be carried before the mayor, and six good bells, valued at \u00a350l. to Charles-Church, so called from our kings in whose reigns it was begun and finished. In the entrance of the bay lies the famous Eddystone rock, which is covered at high water, and on which the ingenious Mr Winstanley built a light-house, that was blown down in the terrible hurricane of Nov. 27th 1703, and himself, with others that were with him in it, never more heard of. However, another was erected in the room of it, by the corporation of the Trinity-house, in the time of Queen Anne, which was destroyed by an accidental fire Dec. 4th 1755, but rebuilt in 1759; which also was burnt down, and rebuilt by the celebrated Smeaton in the year 1770. In the reign of Edward III., the French landed, and burnt part of the town, but were soon repulsed by Hugh Courtenay earl of Devon. In the reign of Henry IV., the French landed here again, and burnt 600 houses. Between this town and the sea is a hill called the Hau, which has a delightful plain on the top, having a pleasant prospect all round it, and a good landmark for the use of mariners. The list of parliament-men for this borough, formerly divided into two parts, by the names of Sutton-Valtort and Sutton-Prior, commences the 26th of Edward I., and continues to the 14th of Edward III., after which we find no return made for it till the 20th of Henry VI., when the privilege was renewed. On the Hau is a fort, which at once commands the town and defends the harbour. Here is a ferry over the Tamar, called Crumwell or Crimble Passage, the west side of which is called Welton-House, and is in Devonshire, though most of the parish wherein it stands is in Cornwall. In April 1759 parliament granted \u00a35,159l. for the better fortifying the town and dock of Plymouth. N. Lat. 50\u00b0 26'. W.

The word, in its original meaning, expresses a quality of air, or more properly of breath. Under the article Physics we observed, that in a great number of languages the term used to express breath was also one of the terms used to express the animating principle, nay, the intellectual substance, the soul. It has been perhaps owing to some attention to this chance of confusion that our philosophers have appropriated the term Pneumatics to the science of the mechanical properties of air, and Pneumatology to the science of the intellectual phenomena consequent on the operations or affections of our thinking principle.\n\nWe have extended (on the authority of present custom) the term Pneumatics to the study of the mechanical properties of all elastic or sensibly compressible fluids, that is, of fluids whose elasticity and compressibility become an interesting object of our attention; as the term Hydrostatics is applied to the study of the mechanical properties of such bodies as interest us by their fluidity or liquidity only, or whose elasticity and compressibility are not familiar or interesting, though not less real or general than in the case of air and all vapours.\n\nWe may be indulged in the observation by the bye, that there is no precise limit to the different classes of natural bodies with respect to their mechanical properties. There is no such thing as a body perfectly hard, perfectly soft, perfectly elastic, or perfectly incompressible. All bodies have some degree of elasticity intermixed with some degree of ductility. Water, mercury, oil, are compressible; but their compressibility need not be attended to in order perfectly to understand the phenomena consequent on their materiality, fluidity, and gravity. But if we neglect the compressibility of air, we remain ignorant of the cause and nature of its most interesting phenomena, and are but imperfectly informed with respect to those in which its elasticity has no share; and it is convenient to attend to this distinction in our researches, in order to understand those phenomena which depend solely or chiefly on compressibility and elasticity. This observation is important; for here elasticity appears in its most simple form, unaccompanied with any other mechanical affection of matter (if we except gravity), and lies most open to our observation, whether employed for investigating the nature of this very property of bodies, or for explaining its mode of action. We shall even find that the constitution of an avowedly elastic fluid, whose compressibility is so very sensible, will give us the distinctest notions of fluidity in general, and enable us to understand its characteristic appearance, by which it is distinguished from solidity, namely, the equable distribution of pressure through all its parts in every direction, and the horizontality which its surface attains by the action of gravity: phenomena which have been assumed as equivalent to the definition of a perfect fluid, and from which all the laws of hydrostatics and hydraulics have been derived. And these laws have been applied to the explanation of the phenomena around us; and water, mercury, oil, &c. have been denominated fluid only because their appearances have been found to tally exactly with the consequences of this definition, while the definition itself remains in the form of an assumption, unsupported by any other proof of its obtaining in nature. A real mechanical philosopher will therefore attach himself with great eagerness to this property, and consider it as an introduction to much natural science.\n\nOf all the sensible compressible fluids air is the most familiar, was the first studied, and the most minutely examined. It has therefore been generally taken as the example of their mechanical properties, while those mechanical properties which are peculiar to any of them, and therefore characteristic, have usually been treated as an appendix to the general science of pneumatics. No objection occurs to us against this method, which will therefore be adopted in treating this article.\n\nBut although the mechanical properties are the proper subjects of our consideration, it will be impossible properly to avoid considering occasionally properties which are of it, more of a chemical nature; because they occasion such modifications of the mechanical properties as would frequently be unintelligible without considering them in conjunction with the other; and, on the other hand, the mechanical properties produce such modifications of the properties merely chemical, and of very interesting phenomena consequent on them, that these would often pass unexplained unless we give an account of them in this place.\n\nBy mechanical properties we would be understood to mean such as produce, or are connected with, sensible properties, changes of motion, and which indicate the presence and agency of moving or mechanical powers. They are therefore the subject of mathematical discussion; admitting","sp":288,"ep":288},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"ting of measure, number, and direction, notions purely mathematical.\n\nWe shall therefore begin with the consideration of air.\n\nIt is by no means an idle question, \"What is this air of which so much is said and written?\" We see nothing, we feel nothing. We find ourselves at liberty to move about in any direction without any let or hindrance. Whence, then, the affection, that we are surrounded with a matter called air? A few very simple observations and experiments will show us that this affec- tion is well founded.\n\nWe are accustomed to say, that a vessel is empty when we have poured out of it the water which it contained. Take a cylindrical glass jar (fig. 1.), having a small hole in its bottom; and having stopped this hole, fill the jar with water, and then pour out the water, leaving the glass empty, in the common acceptation of the word. Now, throw a bit of cork, or any light body, on the surface of water in a cistern; cover this with the glass jar A held in the hand with its bottom upwards, and move it downwards, as at B, keeping it all the while in an upright position. The cork will continue to float on the surface of the water in the inside of the glass, and will most distinctly show whereabouts that surface is. It will thus be seen, that the water within the glass has its surface considerably lower at C than that of the surrounding water; and however deep we immerse the glass, we shall find that the water will never rise in the inside of it so as to fill it. If plunged to the depth of 32 feet, the water will only half fill it; and yet the acknowledged laws of hydrostatics tell us, that the water would fill the glass if there were nothing to hinder it. There is therefore something already within the glass which prevents the water from getting into it; manifesting in this manner the most distinctive property of matter, viz. the hindering other matter from occupying the same place at the same time.\n\nWhile things are in this condition, pull the stopper D out of the hole in the bottom of the jar, and the water will instantly rise in the inside of the jar, and stand at an equal height within and without. This is justly ascribed to the escape through the hole of the matter which formerly obstructed the entry of the water; for if the hand be held before the hole, a puff will be distinctly felt; or a feather held there will be blown aside; indicating in this manner that what prevented the entry of the water, and now escapes, possesses another characteristic property of matter, impulsive force. The materiality is concluded from this appearance, in the same manner that the materiality of water is concluded from the impulse of a jet from a pipe. We also feel the mobility of the formerly pent up, and now liberated, substance, in consequence of external pressure, viz. the pressure of the surrounding water.\n\nAllo, if we take a smooth cylindrical tube, shut at one end, and fit a plug, or cork to its open end, so as to slide along it, but so tightly as to prevent all passage by its sides; and if the plug be well soaked in grease, we shall find that no force whatever can push it to the bottom of the tube. There is therefore something within the tube preventing by its impenetrability the entry of the plug, and therefore possessing this characteristic of matter.\n\nIn like manner, if, after having opened a pair of com-\n\nmon bellows, we shut up the nozzle and valve hole, and try to bring the boards together, we find it impossible. There is something included which prevents this, in the same manner as if the bellows were filled with wool; but on opening the nozzle we can easily shut them, viz. by expelling this something; and if the compression be forcible, the something will issue with considerable force, and very sensibly impel anything in its way.\n\nIt is not accurate to say, that we move about without any obstruction: for we find, that if we endeavour mobility, to move a large fan with rapidity, a very sensible hindrance is perceived, and that a very sensible force must be exerted; and a sensible wind is produced, which will agitate the neighbouring bodies. It is therefore justly concluded that the motion is possible only in consequence of having driven this obstructing substance out of the way; and that this impenetrable, resisting, movable, impelling substance, is matter. We perceive the perseverance of this matter in its state of rest when we wave a fan, in the same manner that we perceive the inertia of water when we move a paddle through it. The effects of wind in impelling our ships and mills, in tearing up trees, and overturning buildings, are equal indications of its perseverance in a state of motion.\n\nTo this matter, when at rest, we give the name Air; and when it is in motion we call it Wind.\n\nAir, therefore, is a material fluid: a fluid, because its parts are easily moved, and yield to the smallest influence of pressure.\n\nAir possesses some others of the very general, though not essential, properties of matter. It is heavy. This appears from the following facts.\n\n1. It always accompanies this globe in its orbit round the sun, surrounding it to a certain distance, under the name of the Atmosphere, which indicates the being connected with the earth by its general force of gravity. It is chiefly in consequence of this that it is continually moving round the earth from east to west; forming what is called the trade-wind, to be more particularly considered afterwards. All that is to be observed on this subject at present is, that, in consequence of the disturbing force of the sun and moon, there is an accumulation of the air of the atmosphere, in the same manner as of the waters of the ocean, in those parts of the globe which have the moon near their zenith or nadir: and as this happens successively, going from the east to the west (by the rotation of the earth round its axis in the opposite direction), the accumulated air must gradually flow along to form the elevation. This is chiefly to be observed in the torrid zone; and the generality and regularity of this motion are greatly disturbed by the changes which are continually taking place in different parts of the atmosphere from causes which are not mechanical.\n\n2. It is in like manner owing to the gravity of the supports air that it supports the clouds and vapours which we see constantly floating in it. We have even seen bodies of no inconsiderable weight float, and even rise, in the air. Soap bubbles, and balloons filled with inflammable gas, rise and float in the same manner as a cork rises in water. This phenomenon proves the weight of the air, in the same manner that the swimming of a piece of wood indicates the weight of the water which supports it.\n\n3. But we are not left to these refined observations proofs of its weight.\nfor the proof of the air's gravity. We may observe familiar phenomena, which would be immediate consequences of the supposition that air is a heavy fluid, and, like other heavy fluids, presses on the outsides of all bodies immersed in or surrounded by it. Thus, for instance, if we shut the nozzle and valve hole of a pair of bellows after having squeezed the air out of them, we shall find that a very great force, even some hundred pounds, is necessary for separating the boards. They are kept together by the pressure of the heavy air which surrounds them in the same manner as if they were immersed in water. In like manner, if we stop the end of a syringe after its piston has been pressed down to the bottom, and then attempt to draw up the piston, we shall find a considerable force necessary, viz. about 15 or 16 pounds for every square inch of the section of the syringe. Exerting this force, we can draw up the piston to the top, and we can hold it there; but the moment we cease acting, the piston rushes down and strikes the bottom. It is called a suction, as we feel something as it were drawing in the piston; but it is really the weight of the incumbent air pressing it in. And this obtains in every position of the syringe; because the air is a fluid, and presses in every direction. Nay, it presses on the syringe as well as on the piston; and if the piston be hung by its ring on a nail, the syringe requires force to draw it down (just as much as to draw the piston up); and if it be let go, it will spring up, unless loaded with at least 15 pounds for every square inch of its transverse section (see fig. 2.).\n\n4. But the most direct proof of the weight of the air is had by weighing a vessel empty of air, and then weighing it again when the air has been admitted; and this, as it is the most obvious consequence of its weight, has been asserted as long ago as the days of Aristotle. He says (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u039f\u1f50\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd, iv. 4.), \"That all bodies are heavy in their place except fire; even air is heavy; for a blown bladder is heavier than when it is empty.\" It is somewhat surprising that his followers should have gone into the opposite opinion, while professing to maintain the doctrine of their leader. If we take a very large and limber bladder, and squeeze out the air very carefully, and weigh it, and then fill it till the wrinkles just begin to disappear, and weigh it again, we shall find no difference in the weight. But this is not Aristotle's meaning; because the bladder, considered as a vessel, is equally full in both cases, its dimensions being changed. We cannot take the air out of a bladder without its immediately collapsing. But what would be true of a bladder would be equally true of any vessel.\n\nTherefore, take a round vessel A (fig. 3.), fitted with a stopcock B, and syringe C. Fill the whole with water, and press the piston to the bottom of the syringe. Then keeping the cock open, and holding the vessel upright, with the syringe undermost, draw down the piston. The water will follow it by its weight, and leave part of the vessel empty. Now shut the cock, and again push up the piston to the bottom of the syringe; the water escapes through the piston valve, as will be explained afterward; then opening the cock, and again drawing down the piston, more water will come out of the vessel. Repeat this operation till all the water have come out. Shut the cock, unscrew the syringe, and weigh the vessel very accurately. Now open the cock, and admit the air, and weigh the vessel again, it will be found heavier than before, and this additional weight is the weight of the air which fills it; and it will be found to be 523 grains, about an ounce and a fifth avoirdupois, for every cubic foot that the vessel contains. Now since a cubic foot of water would weigh 1000 ounces, this experiment would show that water is about 840 times heavier than air. The most accurate judgment of this kind of which we have met with an account is that recorded by Sir George Shuckburgh, which is in the 67th vol. of the Philosophical Transactions, p. 560. From this it follows, that when the air is of the temperature 53\u00b0, and the barometer stands at 29\u00bd inches, the air is 836 times lighter than water. But the experiment is not susceptible of sufficient accuracy for determining the exact weight of a cubic foot of air. Its weight is very small; and the vessel must be strong and heavy, so as to overload any balance that is sufficiently nice for the experiment.\n\nTo avoid this inconvenience, the whole may be weighed in water, first loading the vessel so as to make convenient it preponderate an ounce or two in the water. By this method of means the balance will be loaded only with this small preponderance. But even in this case there are considerable sources of error, arising from changes in the specific gravity of the water and other causes. The experiment has often been repeated with this view, and the air has been found at a medium to be about 840 times as light as water, but with great variations, as may be expected from its very heterogeneous nature, in consequence of its being the menstruum of almost every fluid, of all vapors, and even of most solid bodies; all which it holds in solution, forming a fluid perfectly transparent, and of very different density according to its composition. It is found, for instance, that perfectly pure air of the temperature of our ordinary summer is considerably denser than when it has dissolved about half as much water as it can hold in that temperature; and that with this quantity of water the difference of density increases in proportion as the mass grows warmer, for damp air is more expandible by heat than dry air. We have had occasion to consider this subject when treating of the connection of the mechanical properties of air with the state of the weather. See Meteorology.\n\nSuch is the result of the experiment suggested by this proposition, evidently proving the weight of the air; and yet, as has been observed, the Peripatetics, who professed air denied to follow the dictates of Aristotle, uniformly refused it this property. It was a matter long debated among the philosophers of the last century. The reason was, that Aristotle, with that indistinctness and inconsistency, ed by their master, which is observed in all his writings which relate to matters of fact and experience, affirms a different cause to many phenomena which any man led by common observation would ascribe to the weight of the air. Of this kind is the rise of water in pumps and syphons, which all the Peripatetics had for ages ascribed to something which they called nature's abhorrence of a void. Aristotle had asserted (for reasons not our business to adduce at present), that all nature was full of being, and that nature abhorred a void. He adduces many facts, in which it appears, that if not absolutely impossible, it is very difficult, and requires great force, to produce a space void of matter. When the operation of pumps and syphons came to be known, the philosophers of Europe (who had all embraced the Peripatetic doctrines)","sp":288,"ep":290},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Pumps were then constructed in the following manner: A long pipe GB (fig. 4) was set in the water of the well A. This was fitted with a sucker or piston C, having a long rod CP, and was furnished with a valve B at the bottom, and a lateral pipe DE at the place of delivery, also furnished with a valve. The fact is, that if the piston be thrust down to the bottom, and then drawn up, the water will follow it; and upon the piston being again pushed down, the water shuts the valve B by its weight, and escapes or is expelled at the valve E; and on drawing up the piston again the valve E is shut, the water again rises after the piston, and is again expelled at its next descent.\n\nThe Peripatetics explain all this by saying, that if the water did not follow the piston there would be a void between them. But nature abhors a void; or a void is impossible; therefore the water follows the piston.\n\nIt is not worth while to criticise this wretched reasoning in this pretence to explanation. It is all overturned by one observation. Suppose the pipe shut at the bottom, the piston can be drawn up, and thus a void produced. No, say the Peripatetics; and they speak of certain spirits, effluvia, &c., which occupy the place. But if so, why needs the water rise? This therefore is not the cause of its ascent. It is a curious and important phenomenon.\n\nThe sagacious Galileo seems to have been the first who seriously ascribed this to the weight of the air. Many before him had supposed air heavy; and thus explained the difficulty of raising the board of bellows, or the piston of a syringe, &c. But he distinctly applies to this allowed weight of the air all the consequences of hydrostatic laws; and he reasons as follows.\n\nThe heavy air rests on the water in the cistern, and presses it with its weight. It does the same with the water in the pipe, and therefore both are on a level; but if the piston, after being in contact with the surface of the water, be drawn up, there is no longer any pressure on the surface of the water within the pipe; for the air now rests on the piston only, and thus occasions a difficulty in raising it up. The water in the pipe, therefore, is in the same situation as if more water were poured into the cistern, that is, as much as would exert the same pressure on its surface as the air does. In this case we are certain that the water will be pressed into the pipe, and will raise up the water already in it, and follow it till it is equally high within and without. The same pressure of the air shuts the valve E during the descent of the piston. (See Gal. Discourses.)\n\nHe did not wait for the very obvious objection, that if the rise of the water was the effect of the air's pressure, it would also be its measure, and would be raised and supported only to a certain height. He directly said so, and adduced this as a decisive experiment. If the horror of a void be the cause, says he, the water must rise to any height however great; but if it be owing to the pressure of the air, it will only rise till the weight of the water in the pipe is in equilibrium with the pressure of the air, according to the common laws of hydrostatics. And he adds, that this is well known; for it is a fact, that pumps will not draw water much above forty palms; although they may be made to propel it, or to lift it to any height. He then makes an affirmation, which, if true, will be decisive. Let a very long pipe, shut at one end, be filled with water, and let it be erected perpendicularly with the close end uppermost, and a stopper in the other end, and then its lower orifice immersed into a vessel of water; the water will subside in the pipe upon removing the stopper, till the remaining column is in equilibrium with the pressure of the external air. This experiment he proposes to the curious; saying, however, that he thought it unnecessary, their being already such abundant proofs of the air's pressure.\n\nIt is probable that the cumberomeness of the necessary apparatus prevented the making of this experiment. Another equally conclusive, and much earlier, was made in 1642 after Galileo's death, by his zealous and learned disciple Torricelli. He filled a glass tube, close at one end, with mercury; judging, that if the support of the water was owing to the pressure of the air, and was the measure of this pressure, mercury would in like manner be supported by it; and this at a height which was also the measure of the air's pressure, and therefore 13 times less than water. He had the pleasure of seeing his expectation verified in the complete manner; the mercury descending in the tube AB (fig. 5), and finally settling at the height f'B of 29\u00bd Roman inches; and he found, that when the tube was inclined, the point f was in the same horizontal plane with f' in the upright tube, according to the received laws of hydrostatical pressure. The experiment was often repeated, and soon became famous, exciting great controversies among the philosophers about the possibility of a vacuum. About three years afterwards the same experiment was published, at Warsaw in Poland, by Valerianus Magnus, as his own suggestion and discovery; but it appears plain from the letters of Roberval, not only that Torricelli was prior, and that his experiment was the general topic of discussion among the curious; but also highly probable that Valerianus Magnus was informed of it when at Rome, and daily conversant with those who had seen it. He denies, however, even having heard of the name of Torricelli.\n\nThis was the era of philosophical ardour; and we think that it was Galileo's invention and immediate application of the telescope which gave it vigour. Discoveries of the most wonderful kind in the heavens, and which required no extent of previous knowledge to understand them, were thus put into the hands of every person who could purchase a spy-glass; while the high degree of credibility which some of the discoveries, such as the phases of Venus and the rotation and satellites of Jupiter, gave to the Copernican system, immediately set the whole body of the learned in motion. Galileo joined to his ardour a great extent of learning, particularly of mathematical knowledge and found logic, and was even the first who formally united mathematics with physics; and his treatise on accelerated motion was the first, and a precious fruit of this union. About the years 1642 and 1644, we find clubs of gentlemen associated in Oxford and London for the cultivation of knowledge by experiment; and Society, before 1655 all the doctrines of hydrostatics and pneumatics were familiar there, established upon experiment. Mr Boyle procured a coalition and correspondence of these clubs under the name of the Invisible and Philosophical Society. In May 1658 Mr Hooke finished for Mr Boyle...\nBoyle an air-pump, which had employed him a long time, and occasioned him several journeys to London for things which the workmen of Oxford could not execute. If he speaks of this as a great improvement on Mr Boyle's own pump, which he had been using some time before. Boyle therefore must have invented his air-pump, and was not indebted for it to Schottus's account of Otto Guericke's, published in his (Schottus) Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica in 1657, as he affirms (Techna Curio). The Royal Society of London arose in 1666 from the coalition of these clubs, after 15 years co-operation and correspondence. The Montmorin Society at Paris had subsisted nearly about the same time; for we find Pauchal in 1648 speaking of the meetings in the Sorbonne College, from which we know that society originated.\u2014Nuremberg, in Germany, was also a distinguished seminary of experimental philosophy. The magistrates, sensible of its valuable influence in many manufactures, the source of the opulence and prosperity of their city, and many of them philosophers, gave philosophy a professed and munificent patronage, furnishing the philosophers with a copious apparatus, a place of assembly, and a fund for the expense of their experiments; so that this was the first academy of sciences out of Italy under the patronage of government. In Italy, indeed, there had long existed institutions of this kind. Rome was the centre of church-government, and the resort of all expectants for preferment. The clergy was the majority of the learned in all Christian nations, and particularly of the systematic philosophers. Each, eager to recommend himself to notice, brought forward every thing that was curious; and they were the willing vehicles of philosophical communication. Thus the experiments of Galileo and Torricelli were rapidly diffused by persons of rank, the dignitaries of the church, or by the monks their obsequious servants. Perhaps the recent defection of England, and the want of a residing embassy at Rome, made her sometimes late in receiving or spreading philosophical researches, and was the cause that more was done there proprio Morte.\n\nWe hope to be excused for this digression. We were naturally led into it by the pretensions of Valerianus Magnus to originality in the experiment of the mercury supported by the pressure of the air. Such is the strength of national attachment, that there were not wanting some who found that Torricelli had borrowed his experiment from Honoratus Fabri, who had proposed and explained it in 1643; but whoever knows the writings of Torricelli, and Galileo's high opinion of him, will never think that he could need such helps. (See this surmise of Mounier in Schott. Tech. Cur. III. at the end).\n\nGalileo must be considered as the author of the experiment when he proposes it to be made. Valerianus Magnus owns himself indebted to him for the principle and the contrivance of the experiment. It is neither wonderful that many ingenious men, of one opinion, and instructed by Galileo, should separately hit on so obvious a thing; nor that Torricelli, his immediate disciple, his enthusiastic admirer, and who was in the habit of corresponding with him till his death in 1642, should be the first to put it in practice. It became the subject of dispute from the national arrogance and self-conceit of some Frenchmen, who have always shown themselves disposed to consider their nation as at the head of the republic of letters, and cannot brook the concurrence of any foreigners. Roberval was in this instance, however, the champion of Torricelli; but those who know his controversies with the mathematicians of France at this time will easily account for this exception.\n\nAll now agree in giving Torricelli the honour of the unjustly rejected invention; and it universally passes by the name of the Torricellian Experiment. The tube is called the Torricellian Tube; and the space left by the mercury is called the Torricellian Vacuum, to distinguish it from the Boylean Vacuum, which is only an extreme rarefaction.\n\nThe experiment was repeated in various forms, and it was repeated with apparatus which enabled philosophers to examine various effects which the vacuum produced on bodies exposed in it. This was done by making the upper part of the tube terminate in a vessel of some capacity, or communicate with such a vessel, in which were included along with the mercury bodies on which the experiments were to be made. When the mercury had run out, the phenomena of these bodies were carefully observed.\n\nAn objection was made to the conclusion drawn from an objection to Torricelli's experiment, which appears formidable. If the conclusion is found that the counterpoise must be equal to the weight of both the tube and the mercury it contains. This could not be, say the objectors, if the mercury were supported by the air. It is evidently supported by the balance; and this gave rise to another notion of the cause different from the peripatetic fugae vacui: a suspensive force, or rather attraction, was assigned to the upper part of the tube.\n\nBut the true explanation of the phenomenon is most easy and satisfactory. Suppose the mercury in the cistern and tube to freeze, but without adhering to the tube, so that the tube could be freely drawn up and down. In this case the mercury is supported by the base, without any dependence on the pressure of the air; and the tube is in the same condition as before, and the solid mercury performs the office of a piston to this kind of syringe. Suppose the tube thrust down till the top of it touches the top of the mercury. It is evident that it must be drawn up in opposition to the pressure of the external air, and it is precisely similar to the syringe mentioned in No. 16. The weight sustained thereby by this arm of the balance is the weight of the tube and the downward pressure of the atmosphere on its top.\n\nThe curiosity of philosophers being thus excited by this very manageable experiment, it was natural now to try the original experiment proposed by Galileo. Accordingly Berti in Italy, Pauchal in France, and many others in different places, made the experiment with a tube filled with water, wine, oil, &c., and all with the success which might be expected in so simple a matter; and hence the doctrine of the weight and pressure of the air was established beyond contradiction or doubt. All this was done before the year 1648.\u2014A very beautiful experiment was exhibited by Auzout, which completely satisfied all who had any remaining doubts.\n\nA small box or phial EFGH (fig. 6.) had two glass tubes, AB, CD, three feet long, inserted into it in such a manner as to be firmly fixed in one end, and to reach nearly to the other end. AB was open at both ends, and CD was closed at D. This apparatus was completely filled with mercury, by unscrewing the tube AB, filling...\nling the box, and the tube CD; then screwing in the tube AB, and filling it: then holding a finger on the orifice A, the whole was inverted and set upright in the position represented in figure B, immersing the orifice A (now a of fig. B) in a small vessel of quicksilver. The result was, that the mercury ran out at the orifice a, till its surface m n within the phial descended to the top of the tube b a. The mercury also began to descend in the tube d c formerly DC) and run over into the tube b a, and run out at a, till the mercury in d c was very near equal in a level with m n. The mercury descending in b a till it stood at k, 29\u00bd inches above the surface o p of the mercury in the cistern, just as in the Torricellian tube.\n\nThe rationale of this experiment is very easy. The whole apparatus may first be considered as a Torricellian tube of an uncommon shape, and the mercury would flow out at a. But as soon as a drop of mercury comes out, leaving a space above m n, there is nothing to keep up the mercury in the tube d c. Its mercury therefore descends also; and running over into b a, continues to supply its expense till the tube d c is almost empty, or can no longer supply the waste of b a. The inner surface therefore falls as low as it can, till it is level with b. No more mercury can enter b a, yet its column is too heavy to be supported by the pressure of the air on the mercury in the cistern below; it therefore descends in b a, and finally settles at the height h o, equal to that of the mercury in the Torricellian tube.\n\nThe prettiest circumstance of the experiment remains. Make a small hole g in the upper cap of the box. The external air immediately rushes in by its weight, and now presses on the mercury in the box. This immediately raises the mercury in the tube d c to l, 29\u00bd inches above m n. It presses on the mercury at k in the tube b a, balancing the pressure of the air in the cistern. The mercury in the tube therefore is left to the influence of its own weight, and it descends to the bottom. Nothing can be more apposite or decisive.\n\nAnd thus the doctrine of the gravity and pressure of the air is established by the most unexceptionable evidence: and we are entitled to affirm it as a statistical principle, and to affirm a priori all its legitimate consequences.\n\nAnd in the first place, we obtain an exact measure of the pressure of the atmosphere. It is precisely equal to the weight of the column of mercury, of water, of oil, &c., which it can support; and the Torricellian tube, or others fitted upon the same principle, are justly termed barometers and barometers with respect to the air. Now it is observed that water is supported at the height of 32 feet nearly: The weight of the column is exactly 2000 avoirdupois pounds on every square foot of base, or 13\u00bd on every square inch. The same conclusion very nearly may be drawn from the column of mercury, which is nearly 29\u00bd inches high when in equilibrium with the pressure of the air. We may here observe, that the measure taken from the height of a column of water, wine, spirits, and the other fluids of considerable volatility, as chemists term it, is not so exact as that taken from mercury, oil, and the like. For it is observed, that the volatile fluids are converted by the ordinary heat of our climates into vapour when the confining pressure of the air is removed; and this vapour, by its elasticity, exerts a small pressure on the surface of the water, &c., in the pipe, and thus counteracts a small part of the external pressure; and therefore the column supported by the remaining pressure must be lighter, that is, shorter. Thus it is found, that rectified spirits will not stand much higher than is competent to a weight of 13 pounds on an inch, the elasticity of its vapour balancing about \u00bc of the pressure of the air. We shall afterwards have occasion to consider this matter more particularly.\n\nAs the medium height of the mercury in the barometer is 29\u00bd inches, we see that the whole globe sustains a pressure equal to the whole weight of a body of mercury of this height; and that all bodies on its surface sustain a part of this in proportion to their surfaces. An ordinary sized man sustains a pressure of several thousand pounds. How comes it then that we are not sensible of a pressure which one should think enough to crush us together? This has been considered as a strong objection to the pressure of the air; for when a man is plunged a few feet under water, he is very sensible of the pressure. The answer is by no means so easy as is commonly imagined. We feel very distinctly the effects of removing this pressure from any part of the body. If any one will apply the open end of a syringe to his hand, and then draw up the plunger, he will find his hand sucked into the syringe with great force, and it will give pain; and the soft part of the hand will swell into it, being pressed in by the neighbouring parts, which are subject to the action of the external air. If one lays his hand on the top of a long perpendicular pipe, such as a pump filled to the brim with water, which is at first prevented from running out by the valve below; and if the valve be then opened, so that the water descends, he will then find his hand so hard pressed to the top of the pipe that he cannot draw it away. But why do we only feel the inequality of pressure? There is a similar instance where-in we do not feel it, although we cannot doubt of its existence. When a man goes slowly to a great depth under water in a diving-bell, we know unquestionably that he is exposed to a new and very great pressure, yet he does not feel it. But those facts are not sufficiently familiar for general argument. The human body is a bundle of solids, hard or soft, filled or mixed with fluids, and there are few or no parts of it which are empty. All communicate either by vessels or pores; and the whole surface is a sieve through which the insensible perspiration is performed. The whole extended surface of the lungs is open to the pressure of the atmosphere; every thing is therefore in equilibrium: and if free or speedy access be given to every part, the body will not be damaged by the pressure, however great, any more than a wet sponge would be deranged by plunging it any depth in water. The pressure is instantaneously diffused by means of the incompressible fluids with which the parts are filled; and if any parts are filled with air or other compressible fluids, these are compressed till their elasticity again balances the pressure. Besides, all our fluids are acquired slowly, and gradually mixed with that proportion of air which they can dissolve or contain. The whole animal has grown up in this manner from the first vital atom of the embryo. For such reasons the pressure can occasion no change of shape by squeezing together the flexible parts; nor any obstruction by compressing the vessels or pores. We cannot say what would be felt by a man, were it possible that he could have been produced.\nduced and grown up in vacuo, and then subjected to the compression. We even know that any sudden and considerable change of general pressure is very severely felt. Persons in a diving-bell have been almost killed by letting them down or drawing them up too suddenly. In drawing up, the elastic matters within have suddenly swelled, and not finding an immediate escape have burst the vessels. Dr Halley experienced this, the blood gushing out from his ears by the expansion of air contained in the internal cavities of this organ, from which there are but very slender palliages.\n\nA very important observation recurs here: the pressure of the atmosphere is variable. This was observed almost as soon as philosophers began to attend to the barometer. Pafchal observed it in France, and Descartes observed it in Sweden in 1650. Mr Boyle and others observed it in England in 1666. And before this, observers, who took notice of the concomitancy of these changes of aerial pressure with the state of the atmosphere, remarked, that it was generally greatest in winter and in the night; and certainly most variable during winter and in the northern regions. Familiar now with the weight of the air, and considering it as the vehicle of the clouds and vapours, they noted with care the connection between the weather and the pressure of the air, and found that a great pressure of the air was generally accompanied with fair weather, and a diminution of it with rain and mists. Hence the barometer came to be considered as an index not only of the present state of the air's weight, but also as indicating by its variations changes of weather. It became a Weather-glass, and continued to be anxiously observed with this view. This is an important subject, and in another place is treated in some detail.\n\nIn the next place, we may conclude that the pressure of the air will be different in different places, according to their elevation above the surface of the ocean: for if air be an heavy fluid, it must press in some proportion according to its perpendicular height. If it be a homogeneous fluid of equal density and weight in all its parts, the mercury in the cistern of a barometer must be pressed precisely in proportion to the depth to which that cistern is immersed in it; and as this pressure is exactly measured by the height of the mercury in the tube, the height of the mercury in the Torricellian tube must be exactly proportional to the depth of the place of observation under the surface of the atmosphere.\n\nThe celebrated Descartes first entertained this thought (Epistle 67, of Pr. III.), and soon after him Pafchal. His occupation in Paris not permitting him to try the justness of his conjecture, he requested Mr Perrier a gentleman of Clermont in Auvergne, to make the experiment, by observing the height of the mercury at one and the same time at Clermont and on the top of a very high mountain in the neighbourhood. His letters to Mr Perrier in 1647 are still extant. Accordingly Mr Perrier, in September 1648, filled two equal tubes with mercury, and observed the heights of both to be the same, viz. 26\u00bd inches, in the garden of the convent of the Friars Minims, situated in the lowest part of Clermont. Leaving one of them there, and one of the fathers to observe it, he took the other to the top of Puy de Dome, which was elevated nearly 500 French fathoms above the garden. He found its height to be 23\u00bd inches. On his return to the town, in a place called Font de l'Arbre, 150 fathoms above the garden, he found it 25 inches; when he returned to the garden it was again 26\u00bd, and the person set to watch the tube which had been left said that it had not varied, the whole day. Thus a difference of elevation of 300 French feet had occasioned a depression of 3\u00bd inches; from which it may be concluded, that 3\u00bd inches of mercury weighs as much as 3000 feet of air, and one-tenth of an inch of mercury as much as 90 feet of air. The next day he found, that taking the tube to the top of a steeple 120 feet high made a fall of one-fifth of an inch. This gives 72 feet of air for one-tenth of an inch of mercury; but ill agreeing with the former experiment. But it is to be observed, that a very small error of observation of the barometer would correspond to a great difference of elevation, and also that the height of the mountain had not been measured with any precision. This has been since done (Mem. Acad. par. 1703), and found to be 529 French toises.\n\nPafchal published an account of this great experiment which (Grande Exp. sur la Penteur de l'air), and it was repeated in many places of the world. In 1653 repeated by it was repeated in England by Dr Power (Power's Exper. Phil.) and in Scotland, in 1661, by Mr Sinclair professor of philosophy in the university of Glasgow, who observed the barometer at Lanark, on the top of Mount Tinto in Clydsdale, and on the top of Arthur's Seat at Edinburgh. He found a depression of two inches between Glasgow and the top of Tinto, three quarters of an inch between the bottom and top of Arthur's Seat, and \u00be of an inch at the cathedral of Glasgow on a height of 126 feet. See Sinclair's Ars Nova et Magna Gravitatis et Levitatis; Sturmii Collegium Experimentalis, and Schottii Technica Curiosa.\n\nHence we may derive a method of measuring the heights of mountains. Having ascertained with great precision the elevation corresponding to a fall of one-tenth of an inch of mercury, which is nearly 90 feet, we have only to observe the length of the mercurial column at the top and bottom of the mountain, and to allow 90 feet for every tenth of an inch. Accordingly this method has been practised with great success: but it requires an attention to many things not yet considered; such as the change of density of the mercury by heat and cold; the changes of density of air, which are much more remarkable from the same causes; and above all, the changes of the density of air from its compressibility; a change immediately connected with or dependent on the very elevation we wish to measure. Of all these afterwards.\n\nThese observations give us the most accurate measure also of the density of air and its specific gravity. This is measured but vaguely though directly measured by weighing the density in a bladder or vessel. The weight of a manageable air quantity is so small, that a balance sufficiently ticklish to indicate even sensible fractions of it is overloaded by the weight of the vessel which contains it, and ceases to be exact: and when we take Bernouilli's ingenious method of suspending it in water, we expose ourselves to great risk of error by the variation of the water's density. Also it must necessarily be humid air which we can examine in this way: but the proportion of an elevation in the atmosphere to the depression of the column of mercury or other fluid, by which we measure its pressure, gives us at once the proportion of this weight.\nweight or their specific gravity. Thus since it is found that in such a state of pressure the barometer stands at 30 inches, and the thermometer at 32\u00b0, 87 feet of rise produces one-tenth of an inch of fall in the barometer, the air and the mercury being both of the freezing temperature, we must conclude that mercury is 10440 times heavier or denser than air. Then, by comparing mercury and water, we get nearly for the density of air relative to water: but this varies so much by heat and moisture, that it is useless to retain any thing more than a general notion of it; nor is it easy to determine whether this method or that by actual weighing be preferable. It is extremely difficult to observe the height of the mercury in the barometer nearer than \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch; and this will produce a difference of even five feet, or \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the whole. Perhaps this is a greater proportion than the error in weighing.\n\nFrom the same experiments we also derive some knowledge of the height of the aerial covering which surrounds our globe. When we raise our barometer 87 feet above the surface of the sea, the mercury falls about one-tenth of an inch in the barometer; therefore if the barometer throws 30 inches at the sea-shore, we may expect that, by raising it 300 times 87 feet or 5 miles, the mercury in the tube will descend to the level of the cistern, and that this is the height of our atmosphere. But other appearances lead us to suppose a much greater height. Meteors are seen with us much higher than this, and which yet give undoubted indication of being supported by our air. There can be little doubt, too, that the visibility of the expanse above us is owing to the reflection of the sun's light by our air. Were the heavenly spaces perfectly transparent, we should no more see them than the purest water through which we see other objects; and we see them as we see water tinged with milk or other sediments. Now it is easy to show, that the light which gives us what is called twilight must be reflected from the height of at least 50 miles; for we have it when the sun is depressed 18 degrees below our horizon.\n\nA little attention to the constitution of our air will convince us, that the atmosphere must extend to a much greater height than 300 times 87 feet. We see from the most familiar facts that it is compressible; we can squeeze it in an ox-bladder. It is also heavy; pressing on the air in this bladder with a very great force, not less than 1500 pounds. We must therefore consider it as in a state of compression, existing in smaller rooms than it would assume if it were not compressed by the incumbent air. It must therefore be in a condition something resembling that of a quantity of fine carded wool thrown loosely into a deep pit; the lower strata carrying the weight of the upper strata, and being compressed by them; and so much the more compressed as they are further down, and only the upper stratum in its unconstrained and most expanded state. If we shall suppose this wool thrown in by a hundred weight at a time, it will be divided into strata of equal weights, but of unequal thicknesses; the lowest being the thinnest, and the superior strata gradually increasing in thickness. Now, suppose the pit filled with air, and reaching to the top of the atmosphere, the weights of all the strata above any horizontal plane in it is measured by the height of the mercury in the Toricellian tube placed in that plane; and one-tenth of an inch of mercury is just equal to the weight of the lowest stratum 87 feet thick: for on raising the tube 87 feet from the sea, the surface of the mercury will descend one-tenth of an inch. Raise the tube till the mercury fall another tenth: This stratum must be more than 87 feet thick; how much more we cannot tell, being ignorant of the law of the air's expansion. In order to make it fall a third tenth, we must raise it through a stratum still thicker; and so on continually.\n\nAll this is abundantly confirmed by the very first experiment made by the order and directions of Pafchal: For by carrying the tube from the garden of the convent to a place 150 fathoms higher, the mercury fell 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, or 1.296\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\); which gives about 69 feet 8 inches of aerial stratum for \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch of mercury; and by carrying it from thence to a place 350 fathoms higher, the mercury fell 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), or 1.916\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, which gives 109 feet 7 inches for \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch of mercury. These experiments were not accurately made; for at that time the philosophers, though zealous, were but scholars in the science of experimenting, and novices in the art. But the results abundantly show this general truth, and they are completely confirmed by thousands of subsequent observations. It is evident from the whole tenor of them, that the strata of air decrease in density as we ascend through the atmosphere; but it remained to be discovered what is the force of this decrease, that is, the law of the air's expansion. Till this be done we can say nothing about the constitution of our atmosphere: we cannot tell in what manner it is fitted for raising and supporting the exhalations and vapours which are continually arising from the inhabited regions; not as an excrementitious waste, but to be supported, perhaps manufactured, in that vast laboratory of nature, and to be returned to us in beneficent showers. We cannot use our knowledge for the curious, and frequently useful purpose of measuring the heights of mountains and taking the levels of extensive regions; in short, without an accurate knowledge of this, we can hardly acquire any acquaintance with those mechanical properties which distinguish air from those liquids which circulate here below.\n\nHaving therefore considered at some length the leading consequences of the air's fluidity and gravity, let us consider its compressibility with the same care; and then, combining the agency of both, we shall answer all the purposes of philosophy, discover the laws, explain the phenomena of nature, and improve art. We proceed therefore to consider a little the phenomena which indicate and characterize this other property of the air. All fluids are elastic and compressible as well as air; but in them the compressibility makes no figure, or does not interest us while we are considering their pressures, motions, and impulsions. But in air the compressibility and expansion draw our chief attention, and make it a proper representative of this class of fluids.\n\nNothing is more familiar than the compressibility of a familiar air. It is seen in a bladder filled with it, which we can phenomenally squeeze into less room; it is seen in a syringe, non, which of which we can push the plug farther and farther as we increase the pressure.\n\nBut these appearances bring into view another, and shows its the most interesting property of air, viz. its elasticity, elasticity. When we have squeezed the air in the bladder or syringe into less room, we find that the force with which we compressed it is necessary to keep it in this bulk; and\nthat if we cease to press it together, it will swell out and regain its natural dimensions. This distinguishes it essentially from such a body as a mass of flour, salt, or such like, which remain in the compressed state to which we reduce them.\n\nThere is something therefore which opposes the compression different from the simple impenetrability of the air: there is something that opposes mechanical force; there is something too which produces motion, not only resisting compression, but pushing back the compressing body, and communicating motion to it. As an arrow is gradually accelerated by the bowstring pressing it forward, and at the moment of its discharge is brought to a state of rapid motion; so the ball from a pop-gun or wind-gun is gradually accelerated along the barrel by the pressure of the air during its expansion from its compressed state, and finally quits it with an accumulated velocity. These two motions are indications perfectly similar of the elasticity of the bow and of the air.\n\nThus it appears that air is heavy and elastic. It needs little consideration to convince us in a vague manner that it is fluid. The case with which it is penetrated, and driven about in every direction, and the motion of it in pipes and channels, however crooked and intricate, entitle it to this character. But before we can proceed to deduce consequences from its fluidity, and to offer them as a true account of what will happen in these circumstances, it is necessary to exhibit some distinct and simple case, in which the characteristic mechanical property of a fluid is clearly and unequivocally observed in it. That property of fluids from which all the laws of hydrostatics and hydraulics are derived with strictest evidence is, that any pressure applied to any part of them is propagated through the whole mass in every direction; and that in consequence of this diffusion of pressure, any two external forces can be put in equilibrium by the interposition of a fluid, in the same way as they can be put in equilibrium by the intervention of any mechanical engine.\n\nLet a close vessel ABC (fig. 7.), of any form, have two upright pipes EDC, GFB, inserted into any parts of its top, sides, or bottom, and let water be poured into them, so as to stand in equilibrium with the horizontal surfaces at E, D, G, F, and let D d, F f, be horizontal lines, it will be found that the height of the column E d is sensibly equal to that of the column G f. This is a fact universally observed in whatever way the pipes are inserted.\n\nNow the surface of the water at D is undoubtedly pressed upwards with a force equal to a column of water, having its surface for its base, and E d for its height; it is therefore prevented from rising by some opposite force. This can be nothing but the elasticity of the confined air pressing it down. The very same thing must be said of the surface at F; and thus there are two external pressures at D and F set in equilibrium by the interposition of air. The force exerted on the surface D, by the pressure of the column E d, is therefore propagated to the surface at F; and thus air has this characteristic mark of fluidity.\n\nIn this experiment the weight of the air is insensible when the vessel is of small size, and has no sensible share in the pressure reaching at D and F. But if the elevation of the point F above D is very great, the column E d will be observed sensibly to exceed the column G f. Thus if F be 70 feet higher than D, E d will be an inch longer than the column G f: for in this case there is reacting at D, not only the pressure propagated from F, but also the weight of a column of air, having the surface at D for its base and 70 feet high. This is equal to the weight of a column of water one inch high.\n\nIt is by this propagation of pressure, this fluidity, that the pellet is discharged from a child's pop gun. It sticks fast in the muzzle; and he forces in another pellet at the other end, which he presses forward with the rammer, condensing the air between them, and thus propagating to the other pellet the pressure which he exerts, till the friction is overcome, and the pellet is discharged by the air expanding and following it.\n\nThere is a pretty philosophical plaything which illustrates this property of air in a very perspicuous manner, and which we shall afterwards have occasion to consider as converted into a most useful hydraulic machine. This is what is usually called Hero's fountain, having been invented by a Syracusan of that name. It consists of two vessels KLMN (fig. 8.), OPQR, which are closed on all sides. The tube AB, having a funnel at top, passes through the uppermost vessel without communicating with it, being soldered into its top and bottom. It also passes through the top of the under-vessel, where it is also soldered, and reaches almost to its bottom. This tube is open at both ends. There is another open tube ST', which is soldered into the top of the under vessel and the bottom of the upper vessel, and reaches almost to its top. These two tubes serve also to support the upper vessel. A third tube GF is soldered into the top of the upper vessel, and reaches almost to its bottom. This tube is open at both ends, but the orifice G is very small. Now suppose the uppermost vessel filled with water to the height EN, E e being its surface a little below T. Stop the orifice G with the finger, and pour in water at A. This will descend through AB, and compress the air in OPQR into its room. Suppose the water in the under vessel to have acquired the surface C c, the air which formerly occupied the whole of the spaces OPQR, and KLeE will now be contained in the spaces o P c C and KLeE; and its elasticity will be in equilibrium with the weight of the column of water, whose base is the surface E e, and whose height is A c. As this pressure is exerted in every part of the air, it will be exerted on the surface E e of the water of the upper vessel; and if the pipe FG were continued upwards, the water would be supported in it to an height EH above E e, equal to A c. Therefore if the finger be now taken off the orifice G, the water will spout up to the same height as if it had been immediately forced out by a column of water A c without the intervention of the air, that is, nearly to H. If instead of the funnel at A, the vessel have a brim VW which will cause the water discharged at G to run down the pipe AB, this fountain will play till all the water in the upper vessel is expended. The operation of this second fountain will be better understood from fig. 9., which an intelligent reader will see is perfectly equivalent to fig. 8. A very powerful engine for raising water upon this principle has long been employed in the Hungarian mines; where the pipe AB is about 200 feet high, and the pipe FG about 120; and the condensation is made in the upper vessel, and communicated...\ncated to the lower, at the bottom of the mine, by a long pipe. See WATER-Works.\n\nWe may now apply to air all the laws of hydrostatics and hydraulics, in perfect confidence that their legitimate consequences will be observed in all its situations. We shall in future substitute, in place of any force acting on a surface of air, a column of water, mercury, or any other fluid whose weight is equal to this force; and as we know distinctly from theory what will be the consequences of this hydrostatic pressure, we shall determine a priori the phenomena in air; and in cases where theory does not enable us to say with precision what is the effect of this pressure, experience informs us in the case of water, and analogy enables us to transfer this to air. We shall find this of great service in some cases, which otherwise are almost delusive in the present state of our knowledge.\n\nFrom such familiar and simple observations and experiments, the fluidity, the heaviness, and elasticity, are discovered of the substance with which we are surrounded, and which we call air. But to understand these properties, and completely to explain their numerous and important consequences, we must call in the aid of more refined observations and experiments, which even this scanty knowledge of them enables us to make; we must contrive some methods of producing with precision any degree of condensation, or rarefaction, of employing or excluding the gravitating pressure of air, and of modifying at pleasure the action of all its mechanical properties.\n\nNothing can be more obvious than a method of compressing a quantity of air to any degree. Take a cylinder or prismatic tube AB (fig. 10.) shut at one end, and fit it with a piston or plug C, so nicely that no air can pass by its sides. This will be best done in a cylindrical tube by a turned stopper, covered with oiled leather, and fitted with a long handle CD. When this is thrust down, the air which formerly occupied the whole capacity of the tube is condensed into less room. The force necessary to produce any degree of compression may be concluded from the weight necessary for pushing down the plug to any depth. But this instrument leaves us little opportunity of making interesting experiments on or in this condensed air; and the force required to make any degree of compression cannot be measured with much accuracy; because the piston must be very close, and have great friction, in order to be sufficiently tight. And as the compression is increased, the leather is more squeezed to the side of the tube; and the proportion of the external force, which is employed merely to overcome this variable and uncertain friction, cannot be ascertained with any tolerable precision. To get rid of these imperfections, the following addition may be made to the instrument, which then becomes what is called the condensing syringe.\n\nThe end of the syringe is perforated with a very small hole ef; and being externally turned to a small cylinder, a narrow lip of bladder, or of thin leather, soaked in a mixture of oil and tallow, must be tied over the hole. Now let us suppose the piston pushed down to the bottom of the barrel to which it applies close; when it is drawn up to the top, it leaves a void behind, and the weight of the external air presses on the lip of bladder, which therefore claps close to the brass, and thus performs the part of a valve, and keeps it close so that no air can enter. But the piston having reached the top of the barrel, a hole F in the side of it is just below the piston, and the air rushes through this hole and fills the barrel. Now push the piston down again, it immediately passes the hole F, and no air escapes through it; it therefore forces open the valve at f, and escapes while the piston moves to the bottom.\n\nNow let E be any vessel, such as a glass bottle, having its mouth furnished with a brass cap firmly cemented to it, having a hollow screw which fits a solid screw p q, turned on the cylindric nozzle of the syringe. Screw the syringe into this cap, and it is evident that the air forced out of the syringe will be accumulated in this vessel: for upon drawing up the piston the valve f always shuts by the elasticity or expanding force of the air in E; and on pushing it down again, the valve will open as soon as the piston has got so far down that the air in the lower part of the barrel is more powerful than the air already in the vessel. Thus at every stroke an additional barrelful of air will be forced into the vessel E; and it will be found, that after every stroke the piston must be farther pushed down before the valve will open. It cannot open till the pressure arising from the elasticity of the air condensed in the barrel is superior to the elasticity of the air condensed in the vessel; that is, till the condensation of the first, or its density, is somewhat greater than that of the last, in order to overcome the straining of the valve on the hole and the sticking occasioned by the clammy matter employed to make it air-tight.\n\nSometimes the syringe is constructed with a valve in the piston. This piston, instead of being of one piece and solid, consists of two pieces perforated. The upper part k l m is connected with the rod or handle, and has its lower part turned down to a small cylinder, which is screwed into the lower part k l n; and has a perforation g h going up in the axis, and terminating in a hole h in one side of the rod, a piece of oiled leather is strained across the hole g. When the piston is drawn up and a void left below it, the weight of the external air forces it through the hole h, opens the valve g, and fills the barrel. Then, on pushing down the piston, the air being squeezed into less room, presses on the valve g, shuts it; and none escaping through the piston, it is gradually condensed as the piston descends till it opens the valve f, and is added to that already accumulated in the vessel E.\n\nHaving in this manner forced a quantity of air into the vessel E, we can make many experiments in it in this state of condensation. We are chiefly concerned at present with the effect which this produces on its elasticity. We see this to be greatly increased; for we find more and more force required for introducing every successive barrelful. When the syringe is uncrowded, we see the air rush out with great violence, and every indication of great expanding force. If the syringe be connected with the vessel E in the same manner as the syringe in No. 17, viz. by interposing a stopcock B between them (see fig. 3.), and if this stopcock have a pipe at its extremity, reaching near to the bottom of the vessel, which is previously half filled with water, we can observe distinctly when the elasticity of the air in the syringe exceeds that of the air in the receiver: for the piston must be pushed down a certain length before the air from the syringe bubbles up through the water, and\nthe piston must be farther down at each successive stroke before this appearance is observed. When the air has thus been accumulated in the receiver, it presses the sides of it outward, and will burst it if not strong enough. It also presses on the surface of the water; and if we now shut the cock, unscrew the syringe, and open the cock again, the air will force the water through the pipe with great velocity, causing it to rise in a beautiful jet. When a metal-receiver is used, the condensation may be pushed to a great length, and the jet will then rise to a great height; which gradually diminishes as the water is expended and room given to the air to expand itself. See the figure.\n\nWe judge of the condensation of air in the vessel E by the number of strokes and the proportion of the capacity of the syringe to that of the vessel. Suppose the first to be one-tenth of the last; then we know, that after 10 strokes the quantity of air in the vessel is doubled, and therefore its density double, and so on after any number of strokes. Let the capacity of the syringe (when the piston is drawn to the top) be \\(a\\), and that of the vessel be \\(b\\), and the number of strokes be \\(n\\), the density of air in the vessel will be \\(\\frac{b + na}{b}\\), or \\(1 + \\frac{n}{b}\\).\n\nBut this is on the supposition that the piston accurately fills the barrel, the bottom of the one applying close to that of the other, and that no force is necessary for opening either of the valves; but the first cannot be injured, and the last is very far from being true. In the construction now described, it will require at least one twentieth part of the ordinary pressure of the air to open the piston valve; therefore the air which gets in will want at least this proportion of its complete elasticity; and there is always a similar part of the elasticity employed in opening the nozzle valve. The condensation therefore is never nearly equal to what is here determined.\n\nIt is accurately enough measured by a gage fitted to the instrument. A glass tube GH of a cylindric bore, and close at the end, is screwed into the side of the cap on the mouth of the vessel E. A small drop of water or mercury is taken into this tube by warming it a little in the hand, which expands the contained air, so that when the open end is dipped into water, and the whole allowed to cool, the water advances a little into the tube. The tube is furnished with a scale divided into small equal parts, numbered from the close end of the tube. Since this tube communicates with the vessel, it is evident that the condensation will force the water along the tube, acting like a piston on the air beyond it, and the air in the tube and vessel will always be of one density. Suppose the number at which the drop stands before the condensation is made to be \\(c\\), and that it stands at \\(d\\) when the condensation has attained the degree required, the density of the air in the remote end of the gage, and consequently in the vessel, will be \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\).\n\nSometimes there is used any bit of tube close at one end, having a drop of water in it, simply laid into the vessel E, and furnished or not with a scale; but this can only be used with glass vessels, and these are too weak to resist the pressure arising from great condensation. In such experiments metallic vessels are used, fitted with a variety of apparatus for different experiments. Some of these will be occasionally mentioned afterwards.\n\nIt must be observed in this place, that very great compressions require great force, and therefore small syringes for great rings. It is therefore convenient to have them of various sizes, and to begin with those of a larger diameter, which operate more quickly; and when the condensation becomes fatiguing, to change the syringe for a smaller.\n\nFor this reason, and in general to make the condensing apparatus more convenient, it is proper to have a cock below the syringe interposed between the syringe and the vessel, between the or as it is usually called the receiver. This consists of a syringe and brass pipe, which has a well-ground cock in its middle, receiver, and has a hollow screw at one end, which receives the nozzle screw of the syringe, and a solid screw at the other end, which fits the screw of the receiver. See fig. 3.\n\nBy these gages, or contrivances similar to them, we have been able to ascertain very great degrees of condensation in the course of some experiments. Dr Hales found, that when dry wood was put into a strong vessel, which it almost filled, and the remainder was filled with water, the swelling of the wood, occasioned by its imbibition of water, condensed the air of his gage into the thousandth part of its original bulk. He found that peas treated in the same way generated elastic air, which pressing on the air in the gage condensed it into the fifteen hundredth part of its bulk. This is the greatest condensation that has been ascertained with precision, although in other experiments it has certainly been carried much farther; but the precise degree could not be ascertained.\n\nThe only use to be made of this observation at present is, that since we have been able to exhibit air in a water to be density a thousand times greater than the ordinary density of the air we breathe, it cannot, as some imagine, be only a different form of water; for in this state it is as dense or denser than water, and yet retains its great expansibility.\n\nAnother important observation is, that in every state and show of density in which we find it, it retains its perfect error of fluidity, transmitting all pressures which are applied to it with undiminished force, as appears by the equality existing constantly observed between the opposing columns of elasticity, water or other fluid by which it is compressed, and by &c., the facility with which all motions are performed in it in the most compressed states in which we can make observations of this kind. This fact is totally incompatible with the opinion of those who ascribe the elasticity of air to the springy ramified structure of its particles, touching each other like so many pieces of sponge or foot-balls. A collection of such particles might indeed be pervaded by solid bodies with considerable ease, if they were merely touching each other, and not subjected to any external pressure. But the moment such pressure is exerted, and the assemblage squeezed into a smaller space, each presses on its adjoining particles; they are individually compressed, flattened in their touching surfaces, and before the density is doubled they are squeezed into the form of perfect cubes, and compose a mass,","sp":290,"ep":298},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Now, suppose the piston at the bottom, the cock C open, and the cock D shut, draw the piston to the from the top. The air which filled the vessel V will expand to operation as to fill both that vessel and the barrel A.B.; and as no reason can be given to the contrary, we must suppose that the air will be uniformly diffused through both. Calling V and B the capacity of the vessel and barrel, it is plain that the bulk of the air will now be $V+B$; and since the quantity of matter remains the same, and the density of a fluid is as its quantity of matter directly and its bulk inversely, the density of the expanded air will be $\\frac{V}{V+B}$, the density of common air being 1: for\n\n$$V+B : V = \\frac{V}{V+B}.$$  \n\nThe piston requires force to raise it, and it is raised in opposition to the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere; the diminution of this has formerly been balanced by the elasticity of the common air: and we conclude from the fact, that force is required to raise the piston, that the elasticity of the expanded air is less than that of air in its ordinary state; and an accurate observation of the force necessary to raise it would show how much the elasticity is diminished. When therefore the piston is let go, it will descend as long as the pressure of the atmosphere exceeds the elasticity of the air in the barrel; that is, till the air in the barrel is in a state of ordinary density. To put it further down will require force, because the air must be compressed in the barrel; but if we open the cock D, the air will be expelled through it, and the piston will reach the bottom.\n\nNow shut the discharging cock D, and open the cock and calculate C, and draw up the piston. The air which occupied late its density, the space V, with the density $\\frac{V}{V+B}$, will now occupy the space $V+B$, if it expands so far. To have its density D, say, As its present bulk $V+B$ is to its former bulk $V$, so is its former density $\\frac{V}{V+B}$ to its new density; which will therefore be $\\frac{V+V}{V+B \\times V+B}$;\n\nor $\\frac{V}{V+B}$.\n\nIt is evident, that if the air continues to expand, the density of the air in the vessel after the third drawing up of the piston will be $\\frac{V}{V+B}$; after the fourth it will be $\\frac{V}{V+B}$; and after any number of strokes n will be $\\frac{V}{V+B}$. Thus, if the vessel is four times as large as the barrel, the density after the fifth stroke will be $\\frac{1}{4}$, nearly $\\frac{1}{4}$ of its ordinary density.\n\nOn the other hand, the number n of strokes necessary for reducing air to the density D is\n\n$$\\log \\frac{D}{\\log V - \\log (V+B)}.$$  \n\nThus we see that this instrument can never abstract some of the whole air in consequence of its expansion, but only convenient rarefy it continually as long as it continues to expand; thus in any case there is a limit beyond which the rarefaction cannot proceed.\nnot go. When the piston has reached the bottom, there remains a small space between it and the cock C filled with common air. When the piston is drawn up, this small quantity of air expands, and also a similar quantity in the neck of the other cock; and no air will come out of the receiver V till the expanded air in the barrel is of a smaller density than the air in the receiver. This circumstance evidently directs us to make these two spaces as small as possible, or by some contrivance to fill them up altogether. Perhaps this may be done effectually in the following manner.\n\nLet BE (fig. 13.) represent the bottom of the barrel, and let the circle HKI be the section of the key of the cock, of a large diameter, and place it as near to the barrel as can be. Let this communicate with the barrel by means of a hole FG widening upwards, as the frustum of a hollow obtuse cone. Let the bottom of the piston b f g e be shaped so as to fit the bottom of the barrel and this hole exactly. Let the cock be pierced with two holes. One of them, HI, passes perpendicularly through its axis, and forms the communication between the receiver and barrel. The other hole, KL, has one extremity K on the same circumference with HI, so that when the key is turned a fourth part round, K will come into the place of H: but this hole is pierced obliquely into the key, and thus keeps clear of the hole HI. It goes no further than the axis, where it communicates with a hole bored along the axis and terminating at its extremity. This hole forms the communication with the external air, and serves for discharging the air in the barrel. (A side view of the key is seen in fig. 14.) Fig. 12 shows the position of the cock while the piston is moving upwards, and fig. 14 shows its position while the piston is moving downwards. When the piston has reached the bottom, the conical piece f h g of the piston, which may be of firm leather, fills the hole FHG, and therefore completely expels the air from the barrel. The canal KL of the cock contains air of the common density; but this is turned aside into the position KL (fig. 13.), while the piston is still touching the cock. It cannot extend into the barrel during the ascent of the piston. In place of it the perforation HLI comes under the piston, filled with air that had been turned aside with it when the piston was at the top of the barrel, and therefore of the same density with the air of the receiver. It appears therefore that there is no limit to the rarefaction as long as the air will expand.\n\nThis instrument is called an Exhausting Syringe. It is more generally made in another form, which is much less expensive, and more convenient in its use. Instead of being furnished with cocks for establishing the communications and shutting them, as is necessary, it has valves like those of the condensing syringe, but opening in the opposite direction. It is thus made:\n\nThe pipe of communication or conduit MN (fig. 15.) has a male screw in its extremity, and over this is tied a slip of bladder or leather M. The lower half of the piston has also a male screw on it, covered at the end with a slip of bladder O. This is screwed into the upper half of the piston, which is pierced with a hole H coming out of the side of the rod.\n\nNow suppose the syringe screwed to the conducting pipe, and that screwed into the receiver V, and the piston at the bottom of the barrel. When the piston is drawn up, the pressure of the external air shuts the valve O, and a void is left below the piston: there is therefore no pressure on the upper side of the valve M to balance the elasticity of the air in the receiver which formerly balanced the weight of the atmosphere. The air therefore in the receiver lifts this valve, and distributes itself between the vessel and the barrel; so that when the piston has reached the top the density of the air in both receiver and barrel is as before\n\n\\[ \\frac{V}{V+B} \\]\n\nWhen the piston is let go it descends, because the elasticity of the expanded air is not a balance for the pressure of the atmosphere, which therefore presses down the piston with the difference, keeping the piston-valve shut all the while. At the same time the valve M also shuts; for it was opened by the prevailing elasticity of the air in the receiver, and while it is open the two airs have equal density and elasticity; but the moment the piston descends, the capacity of the barrel is diminished, the elasticity of its air increases by collapsing, and now prevailing over that of the air in the receiver shuts the valve M.\n\nWhen it has arrived at such a part of the barrel that the air in it is of the density of the external air, there is no force to push it farther down; the hand must therefore press it. This attempts to confine the air in the barrel, and therefore increases its elasticity; so that it lifts the valve O and escapes, and the piston gets to the bottom. When drawn up again, greater force is required than the last time, because the elasticity of the included air is less than in the former stroke. The piston rises further before the valve M is lifted up, and when it has reached the top of the barrel the density of the included air is\n\n\\[ \\frac{V}{V+B} \\]\n\nThe piston, when let go, will descend further than it did before ere the piston-valve opens, and the pressure of the hand will again push it to the bottom, all the air escaping through O. The rarefaction will go on at every succeeding stroke in the same manner as with the other syringe.\n\nThis syringe is evidently more easy in its use, requiring no attendance to the cocks to open and shut them of this type at the proper times. On this account this construction of an exhausting syringe is much more generally used.\n\nBut it is greatly inferior to the syringe with cocksits inferiority with respect to its power of rarefaction. Its operation is greatly limited. It is evident that no air will come out of the receiver unless its elasticity exceed that of the air in the barrel by a difference able to lift up the valve M. A piece of oiled leather tied across this hole can hardly be made tight and certain of clapping to the hole without some small straining, which must therefore be overcome. It must be very gentle indeed not to require a force equal to the weight of two inches of water, and this is equal to about the 200th part of the whole elasticity of the ordinary air; and therefore this syringe, for this reason alone, cannot rarefy air above 200 times, even though air were capable of an indefinite expansion. In like manner the valve O cannot be raised without a similar prevalence of the elasticity of the air in the barrel above the weight of the atmosphere. These causes united, make it difficult to rarefy the air more than 100 times, and very few such syringes will rarely\nrarely it more than 50 times; whereas the syringe with cocks, when new and in good order, will rarely it 1000 times.\n\nBut, on the other hand, syringes with cocks are much more expensive, especially when furnished with apparatus for opening and shutting the cocks. They are more difficult to make equally tight, and (which is the greatest objection) do not remain long in good order. The cocks, by too frequently opening and shutting, grow loose, and allow the air to escape. No method has been found of preventing this. They must be ground tight by means of emery or other cutting powders. Some of these unavoidably stick in the metal, and continue to wear it down. For this reason philosophers, and the makers of philosophical instruments, have turned their chief attention to the improvement of the syringe with valves. We have been thus minute in the account of the operation of rarefaction, that the reader may better understand the value of these improvements, and in general the operation of the principal pneumatic engines.\n\nOf the Air-Pump:\n\nAn Air-Pump is nothing but an exhausting syringe accommodated to a variety of experiments. It was first invented by Otto Guericke, a gentleman of Magdeburgh in Germany, about the year 1654. We trust that it will not be unacceptable to our readers to see this instrument, which now makes a principal article in a philosophical apparatus, in its first form, and to trace it through its successive steps to its present state of improvement.\n\nGuericke, indifferent about the solitary possession of an invention which gave entertainment to numbers who came to see his wonderful experiments, gave a minute description of all his pneumatic apparatus at Gafpar Schottus professor of mathematics at Wurtemberg, who immediately published it with the author's consent, with an account of some of its performances, first in 1657, in his Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica; and then in his Technica Curiosa, in 1664, a curious collection of all the wonderful performances of art which he collected by correspondence over all Europe.\n\nOtto Guericke's air-pump consists of a glass receiver A (fig. 16.) of a form nearly spherical, fitted up with a brass cap and cock B. The nozzle of the cap was fixed to a syringe CDE, also of brass, bent at D into half a right angle. This had a valve at D, opening from the receiver into the syringe, and shutting when pressed in the opposite direction. In the upper side of the syringe there is another valve F, opening from the syringe into the external air, and shutting when pressed inwards. The piston had no valve. The syringe, the cock B, and the joint of the tube, were immersed in a cistern filled with water. From this description it is easy to understand the operation of the instrument. When the piston was drawn up from the bottom of the syringe, the valve F was kept shut by the pressure of the external air, and the valve D opened by the elasticity of the air in the receiver. When it was pushed down again, the valve D immediately shut by the superior elasticity of the air in the syringe; and when this was sufficiently compressed, it opened the valve F, and was discharged. It was immersed in water, that no-air might find its way through the joints or cocks.\n\nIt would seem that this machine was not very perfect, for Guericke says that it took several hours to produce the evacuation of a moderate-sized vessel; but he says, that when it was in good order, the rarefaction (for he acknowledges that it was not, nor could be, a complete evacuation) was so great, that when the cock was opened, and water admitted, it filled the receiver to as sometimes to leave no more than the bulk of a pea filled with air. This is a little surprising; for if the valve F be placed as far from the bottom of the syringe as in Schottus's figure, it would appear that the rarefaction could not be greater than what must arise from the air in DF expanding till it filled the whole syringe: because as soon as the piston in its descent passes F it can discharge no more air, but must compress it between F and the bottom, to be expanded again when the piston is drawn up. It is probable that the piston was not very tight, but that on pressing it down it allowed the air to pass it; and the water in which the whole was immersed prevented the return of the air when it was drawn up again: and this accounts for the great time necessary for producing the desired rarefaction.\n\nGuericke, being a gentleman of fortune, spared no expense, and added a part to the machine, which saved him the trouble of hours attendance of it before they could see the curious experiments with the rarefied air. He made a large copper vessel G (fig. 17.), having a pipe and cock below, which passed through the floor of the chamber into an under apartment, where it was joined to the syringe immersed in the cistern of water, and worked by a lever. The upper part of the vessel terminated in a pipe, furnished with a stopcock H, surrounded with a small brim to hold water for preventing the ingress of air. On the top was another cap I, also filled with water, to protect the junction of the pipes with the receiver K. This great vessel was always kept exhausted, and workmen attended below. When experiments were to be performed in the receiver K, it was set on the top of the great vessel, and the cock H was opened. The air in K immediately diffused itself equally between the two vessels, and was so much more rarefied as the receiver K was smaller than the vessel G. When this rarefaction was not sufficient, the attendants below immediately worked the pump.\n\nThese particulars deserve to be recorded, as they show the inventive genius of this celebrated philosopher, and because they are useful even in the present advanced state of the study. Guericke's method of excluding air from all the joints of his apparatus, by immersing these joints in water, is the only method that has to this day been found effectual; and there frequently occur experiments where this exclusion for a long time is absolutely necessary. In such cases it is necessary to construct little cups or cisterns at every joint, and to fill them with water or oil. In a letter to Schottus, 1662-3, he describes very ingenious contrivances for producing complete rarefaction after the elasticity of the remaining air has been so far diminished that it is not able to open the valves. He opens the exhausting valves by a plug, which is pushed in by the hand; and the discharging valve is opened by a small pump placed on its outside, so that it opens into a void instead of opening against the pressure.\nAir-pump pressure of the atmosphere. (See Schotti Technica Curiosita, p. 68. 70.) These contrivances have been lately added to air-pumps by Haas and Hurter as new inventions.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, that the application of the pump or syringe to the exhaustion of air was a very obvious thought on the principle exhibited in No. 17, and in this way it was also employed by Guericke, who first filled the receiver with water, and then applied the syringe. But this was by no means either his object or his principle. His object was not solely to procure a vessel void of air, but to exhaust the air which was already in it; and his principle was the power which he suspected to be in air of expanding itself into a greater space when the force was removed which he supposed to compress it. He expressly says (Tract. de Experimentis Magdeburgicis, et in Epift. ad Schottum), that the contrivance occurred to him accidentally when occupied with experiments in the Torricellian tube, in which he found that the air would really expand, and completely fill a much larger space than what it usually occupied, and that he had found no limits to the expansion, evincing this by facts which we shall perfectly understand by and by. This was a doctrine quite new, and required a philosophical mind to view it in a general and systematic manner; and it must be owned that his manner of treating the subject is equally remarkable for ingenuity and for modesty. (Epift. ad Schottum.)\n\nHis doctrine and his machine were soon spread over Europe. It was the age of literary ardour and philosophical curiosity; and it is most pleasant to us, who, standing on the shoulders of our predecessors, can see far around us, to observe the eagerness with which every new, and to us frivolous, experiment was repeated and canvassed. The worshippers of Aristotle were daily receiving severe mortifications from the experimenters, or empirics as they affected to call them, and they exerted themselves strenuously in support of his now tottering cause. This contributed to the rapid propagation of every discovery; and it was a most profitable and respectable business to go through the chief cities of Germany and France exhibiting philosophical experiments.\n\nAbout this time the foundations of the Royal Society of London were laid. Mr Boyle, Mr Wren, Lord Brounker, Dr Wallis, and other curious gentlemen, held meetings at Oxford, in which were received accounts of whatever was doing in the study of nature; and many experiments were exhibited. The researches of Galileo, Torricelli, and Pascal, concerning the pressure of the air, greatly engaged their attention, and many additions were made to their discoveries. Mr Boyle, the most ardent and successful student of nature, had the principal share in these improvements, his inquisitive mind being aided by an opulent fortune. In a letter to his nephew Lord Dungarvon, he says that he had made many attempts to see the appearances exhibited by bodies freed from the pressure of the air. He had made Torricellian tubes, having a small vessel a-top, into which he put some bodies before filling the tubes with mercury; so that when the tube was set upright, and the mercury run out, the bodies were in vacuo. He had also abstracted the water from a vessel, by a small pump, by means of its weight, in the manner described in No. 17, having previously put bodies into the vessel along with the water. But all these ways Air-pump were very troublesome and imperfect. He was delighted when he learned from Schottus's first publication, that Counsellor Guericke had effected this by the expansive power of the air; and immediately set about constructing a machine from his own ideas, no description of Guericke's being then published.\n\nIt consisted of a receiver A (fig. 18.), furnished with a stopcock B, and syringe CD placed in a vertical position below the receiver. Its valve C was in its bottom, close adjoining to the entry of the pipe of communication; and the hole by which the air issued was farther secured by a plug which could be removed. The piston was moved by a wheel and rackwork. The receiver of Guericke's pump was ill adapted for any considerable variety of experiments; and accordingly very few pumps were made in it. Mr Boyle's receiver had a large opening EF, with a strong glass margin. To this was fitted a strong brass cap, pierced with a hole G in its middle, to which was fitted a plug ground into it, and shaped like the key of a cock. The extremity of this key was furnished with a screw, to which could be affixed a hook, or a variety of pieces for supporting what was to be examined in the receiver, or for producing various motions within it, without admitting the air. This was farther guarded against by means of oil poured round the key, where it was retained by the hollow cup-like form of the cover. With all these precautions, however, Mr Boyle ingeniously confesses, that it was but seldom, and with great difficulty, that he could produce an extreme degree of rarefaction; and it appears by Guericke's letter to Schottus, that in this respect the Magdeburgh machine had the advantage. But most of Boyle's very interesting experiments did not require this extreme rarefaction; and the variety of them, and their philosophic importance, compensated for this defect, and soon eclipsed the fame of the inventor to such a degree, that the state of air in the receiver was generally denominated the vacuum Boyleanum, and the air-pump was called machina Boyleana. It does not appear that Guericke was at all solicitous to maintain his claim to priority of invention. He appears to have been of a truly noble and philosophical mind, aiming at nothing but the advancement of science.\n\nMr Boyle found, that to make a vessel air-tight, it was sufficient to place a piece of wet or oiled leather on vances to its brim, and to lay a flat plate of metal upon this vessel. The prelude of the external air squeezed the two fold tight bodies so hard together, that the soft leather effectually excluded it. This enabled him to render the whole machine incomparably more convenient for a variety of experiments. He caused the conduit-pipe to terminate in a flat plate which he covered with leather, and on this he set the glass ball or receiver, which had both its upper and lower brim ground flat. He covered the upper orifice in like manner with a piece of oiled leather and a flat plate, having cocks and a variety of other perforations and contrivances suited to his purposes. This he found infinitely more expeditious, and also tighter, than the clammy cements which he had formerly used for securing the joints.\n\nHe was now assisted by Dr Hooke, the most ingenious and inventive mechanic that the world has ever seen. Improvement of this person made a great improvement on the air-pump. Boyle's air-pump by applying two syringes whose piston-rods were worked by\nAir-pump by the same wheel, as in fig. 20, and putting valves in the pistons in the same manner as in the piston of a common pump. This evidently doubled the expedition of the pump's operation; but it also greatly diminished the labour of pumping: for it must be observed, that the piston H must be drawn up against the pressure of the external air, and when the rarefaction is nearly perfect this requires a force of nearly 15 pounds for every inch of the area of the piston. Now when one piston H is at the bottom of the barrel, the other K is at the top of the barrel, and the air below K is equally rare with that in the receiver. Therefore the pressure of the external air on the piston K is nearly equal to that on the piston H. Both, therefore, are acting in opposite directions on the wheel which gave them motion; and the force necessary for raising H is only the difference between the elasticity of the air in the barrel H and that of the air in the barrel K. This is very small in the beginning of the stroke, but gradually increases as the piston K descends, and becomes equal to the whole excess of the air's pressure above the elasticity of the remaining air of the receiver when the air at K of the natural density begins to open the piston valves.\n\nAn accurate attention to the circumstances will show us that the force requisite for working the pump is greatest at first, and gradually diminishes as the rarefaction advances; and when this is nearly complete, hardly any more force is required than what is necessary for overcoming the friction of the pistons, except during the discharge of the air at the end of each stroke.\n\nThis is therefore the form of the air-pump which is most generally used all over Europe. Some traces of national predilection remain. In Germany, air-pumps are frequently made after the original model of Guericke's (Wolff Cyclomathesis); and the French generally use the pump made by Papin, though extremely awkward. We shall give a description of Boyle's air-pump as finally improved by Hawkesbee, which, with some small accommodations to particular views, still remains the most approved form.\n\nHere follows the description from Defaguliers.\n\nIt consists of two brass barrels aa, aa (fig. 19.), 12 inches high and 2 wide. The pistons are raised and depressed by turning the winch bb. This is fastened to an axis passing through a strong toothed wheel, which lays hold of the teeth of the racks cccc. Then the one is raised while the other is depressed; by which means the valves, which are made of timber bladder, fixed in the upper part of each piston, as well as in the openings into the bottom of the barrels, perform their office of discharging the air from the barrels, and admitting into them the air from the receiver to be afterwards discharged; and when the receiver comes to be pretty well exhausted of its air, the pressure of the atmosphere in the descending piston is nearly so great, that the power required to raise the other is little more than is necessary for overcoming the friction of the piston, which renders this pump preferable to all others, which require more force to work them as the rarefaction of the air in the receiver advances.\n\nThe barrels are set in a brass dish about two inches deep, filled with water or oil to prevent the infiltration of air. The barrels are screwed tight down by the nuts ee, ee, which force the frontispiece ff down on them, through which the two pillars gg, gg pass.\n\nVol. XVI. Part II.\nthe weight of the mercury, joined to the elasticity of the rarefied air acting on its upper surface, shall be exactly equal to the whole pressure of the atmosphere. The height of the mercury is the exact measure of that part of the whole pressure which is not balanced by the elasticity of the rarefied air, and its deficiency from the height of the mercury in the Torricellian tube is the exact measure of this remaining elasticity.\n\nIt is evident therefore, that the pipe will be a scale of the elasticity of the remaining air, and will indicate in some sort the degree of rarefaction: for there must be some analogy between the density of the air and its elasticity; and we have no reason to imagine that they do not increase and diminish together, although we may be ignorant of the law, that is, of the change of elasticity corresponding to a known change of density. This is to be discovered by experiment; and the air-pump itself furnishes us with the best experiments for this purpose. After rarefying till the mercury in the gage has attained half the height of that in the Torricellian tube, shut the communication with the barrels and gage, and admit the water into the receiver. It will go in till all is again in equilibrium with the pressure of the atmosphere; that is, till the air in the receiver has collapsed into its natural bulk. This can accurately measure, and compare with the whole capacity of the receiver; and thus obtain the precise degree of rarefaction corresponding to half the natural elasticity. We can do the same thing with the elasticity reduced to one third, one fourth, &c. and thus discover the whole law.\n\nThis gage must be considered as one of the most ingenious and convenient parts of Hawkebees's pump; and it is well disposed, being in a situation protected against accidents; but it necessarily increases greatly the size of the machine, and cannot be applied to the table-pump, represented in fig. 20. When it is wanted here, a small plate is added behind, or between the barrels and receiver; and on this is set a small tubulated (as it is termed) receiver, covering a common weather-glass tube.\u2014This receiver being rarefied along with the other, the pressure on the mercury in the cistern arising from the elasticity of the remaining air is diminished so as to be no longer able to support the mercury at its full height; and it therefore descends till the height at which it stands puts it in equilibrium with the elasticity. In this form, therefore, the height of the mercury is directly a measure of the remaining elasticity; while in the other it measures the remaining unbalanced pressure of the atmosphere. But this gage is extremely cumbersome, and liable to accidents. We are seldom much interested in the rarefaction till it is great: a contracted form of this gage is therefore very useful, and was early used. A syphon ABCD (fig. 21.), each branch of which is about four inches long, close at A and open at D, is filled with boiling mercury till it occupies the branch AB and a very small part of CD, having its surface at O. This is fixed to a small stand, and fixed into the receiver, along with the things that are to be exhibited in the rarefied air. When the air has been rarefied till its remaining elasticity is not able to support the column BA, the mercury descends in AB, and rises in CD, and the remaining elasticity will always be measured by the elevation of the mercury in AB above that in the leg CD. Could the exhaustion be perfected, the surfaces in both legs would be on a level. Another gage might be put into the same foot; having a small bubble of air at A. This would move from the beginning of the rarefaction; but our ignorance of the analogy between the density and elasticity hinders us from using it as a measure of either.\n\nIt is enough for our present purpose to observe, that the barometer or syphon gage is a perfect indication and measure of the performance of an air-pump, and that a pump is (ceteris paribus) so much the more perfect, as it is able to raise the mercury higher in the gage. It is in this way that we discover that none can produce a complete exhaustion, and that their operation is only a very great rarefaction; for none can raise the mercury to that height at which it stands in the Torricellian tube, well purged of air. Few pumps will bring it within one-tenth of an inch. Hawkebees's, fitted up according to his instructions, will seldom bring it within one-fifth. Pumps with cocks, when constructed according to the principles mentioned when speaking of the exhausting syringe, and new and in fine order, will in favourable circumstances bring it within one-fortieth. None with valves fitted up with wet leather, or when water or volatile fluids are allowed access into any part, will bring it nearer than one-fifth. Nay, a pump of the best kind, and in the finest order, will have its rarefying power reduced to the lowest standard, as measured by this gage, if we put into the receiver the tenth part of a square inch of white sheepskin, fresh from the flaps, or of any substance equally damp. This is a discovery made by means of the improved air-pump, and leads to very extensive and important consequences in general physics; some of which will be treated of under this article: and the observation is made thus early, that our readers may better understand the improvements which have been made on this celebrated machine.\n\nIt would require a volume to describe all the changes which have been made on it. An instrument of such multifarious use, and in the hands of curious men, each meets of diving into the secrets of nature in his favourite line, chime, must have received many alterations and real improvements in many particular respects. But these are beside our present purpose; which is to consider it merely as a machine for rarefying elastic or expansive fluids. We must therefore confine ourselves to this view of it; and shall carefully state to our readers every improvement founded on principle, and on pneumatical laws.\n\nAll who used it perceived the limit set to the rarefaction by the resistance of the valves, and tried to perfect the construction of the cocks. The abb\u00e9 Nollet and the Gravelande, two of the most eminent experimental philosophers in Europe, were the most successful.\n\nMr Gravelande justly preferred Hooke's plan of a double pump, and contrived an apparatus for turning Gravelande's cocks by the motion of the pump's handle. This device is far from either being simple or easy in working; and provokes occasions great jerks and concussions in the whole machine. This, however, is not necessarily connected with the truly pneumatical improvement. His piston has no valve, and the rod is connected with it by a stirrup D (fig. 22.), as in a common pump. The rod Fig. 22. has a cylindrical part c, which passes through the stirrup, and has a stiff motion in it up and down of about half an inch; being stopped by the shoulder c above and the nut below. The round plate supported by this stirrup has a short square tube n d, which fits tight into the\nthe hole of a piece of cork F. The round plate E has a square flange g, which goes into the square tube n d. A piece of thin leather f, soaked in oil, is put between the cork and the plate E, and another between the cork and the plate which forms the sole of the stirrup. All these pieces are screwed together by the nail e, whose flat head covers the hole n. Suppose, therefore, the piston touching the bottom of the barrel, and the winch turning to raise it again, the friction of the piston on the barrel keeps it in its place, and the rod is drawn up through the stirrup D. Thus the wheel has liberty to turn about an inch; and this is sufficient for turning the cock, so as to cut off the communication with the external air, and to open the communication with the receiver. This being done, and the motion of the winch continued, the piston is raised to the top of the barrel. When the winch is turned in the opposite direction, the piston remains fixed till the cock is turned, so as to shut the communication with the receiver, and open that with the external air.\n\nThis is a pretty contrivance, and does not at first appear necessary; because the cocks might be made to turn at the beginning and end of the stroke without it. But this is just possible; and the smallest error of adjustment, or wearing of the apparatus, will cause them to be open at improper times. Besides, the cocks are not turned in an instant, and are improperly open during some very small time; but this contrivance completely obviates this difficulty.\n\nThe cock is precisely similar to that formerly described, having one perforation diametrically through it, and another entering at right angles to this, and after reaching the centre, it passes along the axis of the cock, and comes out to the open air.\n\nIt is evident, that by this construction of the cock, the ingenious improvement of Dr Hooke, by which the pressure of the atmosphere on one piston is made to balance (in great part) the pressure on the other, is given up: for, whenever the communication with the air is opened, it rushes in, and immediately balances the pressure on the upper side of the piston in this barrel; so that the whole pressure in the other must be overcome by the person working the pump. Gravefande, aware of this, put a valve on the orifice of the cock; that is, tied a flip of wet bladder or oiled leather across it; and now the piston is pressed down, as long as the air in the barrel is rarer than the outward air, in the same manner as when the valve is in the piston itself.\n\nThis is all that is necessary to be described in Mr Gravefande's air-pump. Its performance is highly extolled by him, as far exceeding his former pumps with valves. The same preference was given to it by his successor Mulchenbroek. But, while they both prepared the pistons and valves and leathers of the pump, by steeping them in oil, and then in a mixture of water and spirits of wine, we are certain that no just estimate could be made of its performance. For with this preparation it could not bring the gage within one-fifth of an inch of the barometer. We even see other limits to its rarefaction: from its construction, it is plain that a very considerable space is left between the piston and cock, not less than an inch, from which the air is never expelled; and if this be made extremely small, it is plain that the pump must be worked very slow, otherwise there will not be time for the air to diffuse itself from the receiver into the barrel, especially towards the end, when the expelling force, viz. the elasticity of the remaining air, is very small. There is also the same limit to the rarefaction, as in Hooke's or Hawkebee's first internal air: and this pump soon lost any advantages it possessed when fresh from the workman's hands, by the cock's growing loose and admitting air. It is surprising that Gravefande omitted Hawkebee's security against this, by placing the barrels in a dish filled with oil; which would effectually have prevented this inconvenience.\n\nWe must not omit a seemingly paradoxical observation of Gravefande, that in a pump constructed with valves, and worked with a determined uniform velocity, the required degree of rarefaction is sooner produced by short barrels than by long ones. It would require too much time to give a general demonstration of this, but it will easily be seen by an example. Suppose the long barrel to have equal capacity with the receiver, then at the end of the first stroke the air in the receiver will have one-half its natural density. Now, let the short barrels have half this capacity: at the end of the first stroke the density of the air in the receiver is two-thirds, and at the end of the second stroke it is four-ninths, which is less than one-half, and the two strokes of the short barrel are supposed to be made in the same time with one of longest, &c.\n\nHawkebee's pump maintained its pre-eminence without rival in Britain, and generally too on the continent, except in France, where everything took the tone of the Academy, which abhorred being indebted to foreigners for anything in science, till about the year 1750, when it engaged the attention of Mr John Smeaton, a person of uncommon knowledge, and second to none but Dr Hooke in sagacity and mechanical resource. He was then a maker of philosophical instruments, and made many attempts to perfect the pumps with cocks, but found, that whatever perfection he could bring them to, he could not enable them to preserve it; and he never would fall one of this construction. He therefore attached himself solely to the valve pumps.\n\nThe first thing was to diminish the resistance to the entry of the air from the receiver into the barrels: this being the rendered almost nothing, by enlarging the surface on which this feebly elastic air was to press. Instead of making these valves to open by its pressure on a circle of one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, he made the valve-hole one inch in diameter, enlarging the surface 400 times; and, to prevent this piece of thin leather from being burst by the great pressure on it, when the piston in its descent was approaching the bottom of the barrel, he supported it by a delicate but strong grating, dividing the valve-hole like the section of a honeycomb, as represented in fig. 25; and the ribs of this grating are seen edgewise in fig. 23, at a b c.\n\nThe valve was a piece of thin membrane or oiled silk, gently strained over the mouth of the valve-hole, the string tied on by a fine silk thread wound round it in the same manner that the narrow slips had been tied on valve, and formerly. This done, he cut with a pointed knife the leather round the edge, nearly four quadrantals arcs, leaving a small tongue between each, as in fig. 25. The strained valve immediately shrinks inwards, as represented.\ned by the shaded parts; and the strain by which it is kept down is now greatly diminished, taking place only at the corners. The gradings being reduced nearly to an edge (but not quite, lest they should cut), there is very little pressure to produce adhesion by the clammy oil. Thus it appears, that a very small elasticity of the air in the receiver will be sufficient to raise the valve; and Mr Smeaton found, that when it was not able to do this at first, when only about \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) of the natural elasticity, it would do it after keeping the piston up eight or ten seconds, the air having been all the while undermining the valve, and gradually detaching it from the grating.\n\nUnfortunately he could not follow this method with the piston valve. There was not room round the rod for such an expanded valve; and it would have obliged him to have a great space below the valve, from which he could not expel the air by the descent of the piston. His ingenuity hit on a way of increasing the expelling force through the common valve: he inclosed the rod of the piston in a collar of leather \\( l \\), through which it moved freely without allowing any air to get past its sides. For greater security, the collar of leather was contained in a box terminating in a cup filled with oil. As this makes a material change in the principle of construction of the air-pump (and indeed of pneumatic engines in general), and as it has been adopted in all the subsequent attempts to improve them, it merits a particular consideration.\n\nThe piston itself consists of two pieces of brass fastened by screws from below. The uppermost, which is of one solid piece with the rod GH (fig. 23.) is of a diameter somewhat less than the barrel; so that when they are screwed together, a piece of leather soaked in a mixture of boiled oil and tallow, is put between them; and when the piston is thrust into the barrel from above, the leather comes up around the side of the piston, and fills the barrel, making the piston perfectly air-tight. The lower half of the piston projects upwards into the upper, which has a hollow \\( g b c d \\) to receive it. There is a small hole through the lower half at \\( a \\) to admit the air; and a hole \\( c d \\) in the upper half to let it through, and there is a lip of oiled silk strained across the hole \\( a \\) by way of valve, and there is room enough left at \\( b c \\) for this valve to rise a little when pressed from below. The rod GH passes through the piece of brass which forms the top of the barrel so as to move freely, but without any sensible shake: this top is formed into a hollow box, consisting of two pieces ECDF and CNOD, which screw together at CD. This box is filled with rings of oiled leather exactly fitted to its diameter, each having a hole in it for the rod to pass through. When the piece ECDF is screwed down, it compresses the leathers, squeezing them to the rod, so that no air can pass between them; and, to secure us against all ingress of air, the upper part is formed into a cup EF, which is kept filled with oil.\n\nThe top of the barrel is also pierced with a hole LK, which rises above the flat surface NO, and has a lip of oiled silk tied over it to act as a valve; opening when pressed from below, but shutting when pressed from above.","sp":298,"ep":306},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"When Mr Nairne was exhibiting these experiments to the Honourable Henry Cavendish in 1776, this gentleman informed him that it appeared from a series of experiments of his father Lord Charles Cavendish, that when water is of the temperature \\( \\frac{72}{5} \\), it is converted into vapour, under any pressure less than three-fourths of an inch of mercury, and at \\( 41^\\circ \\) it becomes vapour when the pressure is less than one-fourth of an inch:\n\nEven mercury evaporates in this manner when all pressure is removed. A dewy appearance is frequently observed covering the inside of the tube of a barometer, where we usually suppose a vacuum. This dew, when viewed through a microscope, appears to be a lot of detached globules of mercury, and upon inclining the tube so that the mercury may ascend along it, these globules will be all licked up, and the tube become clear. The dew which lined it was the vapour of the mercury condensed by the side of the tube; and it is never observed but when one side is exposed to a stream of cold air from a window, &c.\n\nTo return to the vapour in the air-pump receiver, it must be observed, that as long as the water continues to yield it, we may continue to work the pump; and it will be continually attracted by the barrels, and discharged in the form of water, because it collapses as soon as exposed to the external pressure. All this while the gage will not indicate any more rarefaction, because the thing immediately indicated by the barometer-gage is diminished elasticity, which does not happen here.\n\nWhen all the water which the temperature of the room can keep elastic has evaporated under a certain pressure, suppose \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) an inch of mercury, the gage standing at \\( 29.5 \\), the vapour which now fills the receiver expands, and by its diminished elasticity the gage rises, and now some more water which had been attached to bodies by chemical or corpulcular attraction is detached, and a new supply continues to support the gage at a greater height; and this goes on continually till almost all has been attracted; but there will remain some which no art can take away; for as it passes through the barrels, and gets between the piston and the top, it successively collapses into water during the ascent of the piston, and again expands into vapour when we push the piston down again. Whenever this happens there is an end of the rarefaction.\n\nWhile this operation is going on, the air comes out along with the vapour; but we cannot say in what proportion. If it were always uniformly mixed with the vapour, it would diminish rapidly; but this does not appear to be the case. There is a certain period of rarefaction in which a transient cloudiness is perceived in the receiver. This is watery vapour formed at that degree of rarefaction, mingled with, but not dissolved in or united with, the air, otherwise it would be transparent. A similar cloud will appear if damp air be admitted suddenly into an exhausted receiver. The vapour, which formed an uniform transparent mass with the air, is either suddenly expanded and thus detached from the other ingredient, or is suddenly let go by the air, which expands more than it does. We cannot affirm with probability which of these is the case: different compositions of air, that is, air loaded with vapours from different substances, exhibit remarkable differences in this respect. But we see from this and other phenomena, which shall be mentioned in their proper places, that the air and vapour are not always intimately united; and therefore will not always be drawn out together by the air-pump. But let them be ever so confusedly blended, we see that the air must come out along with the vapour, and its quantity remaining in the receiver must be prodigiously diminished by this association, probably much more than could be, had the receiver only contained pure air.\n\nLet us now consider what must happen in the pear-gage. As the air and vapour are continually drawn off from the receiver, the air in the pear expands and goes off with it. We shall suppose that the generated vapour hinders the gage from rising beyond \\( 29.5 \\). During the continued working of the pump, the air in the pear, whose elasticity is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), slowly mixes with the vapour at the mouth of the pear, and the mixture even advances into its inside, so that if the pumping be long enough continued, what is in the pear is nearly of the same composition with what is in the receiver, consisting perhaps of 20 parts of vapour and one part of air, all of the elasticity of \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\nWhen the pear is plunged into the mercury, and the external air allowed to get into the receiver, the mercury rises in the pear-gage, and leaves not \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\times \\frac{1}{20} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{1200} \\) of it filled with common air, the vapour having collapsed into an invisible atom of water. Thus the pear-gage will indicate a rarefaction of \\( \\frac{1}{1200} \\), while the barometer-gage only showed \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\), that is, showed the elasticity of the included substance diminished 60 times. The conclusion to be drawn from these two measures (the one of the rarefaction of air, and the other of the diminution of elasticity) is, that the matter with which the receiver was filled, immediately before the readmission of the air, consisted of one part of imperceptible air, and \\( \\frac{1}{1200} \\), or 20 parts of watery vapour.\n\nThe only obscure part of this account is what relates Difficulty to the composition of the matter which filled the pear, in account gage before the admission of the mercury. It is not easy for me to see how the vapour of the receiver comes in by a narrow mouth while the air is coming out by the same passage; consequently it requires a very long time to produce this extreme rarefaction in the pear-gage; and there are great irregularities in any two succeeding experiments, as may be seen by looking at Mr Nairne's account of them in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxvii. Some vapours appear to have mixed much more readily with the air than others; and there are some unaccountable cases where vitriolic acid and sulphureous bodies were included, in which the diminution of density indicated by the pear-gage was uniformly less than the diminution of elasticity indicated by the barometer-gage. It is enough for us at present to have established, by unquestionable facts, this production of elastic vapour, and the necessity of attending to it, both in the construction of the air-pump and in drawing results from experiments exhibited in it.\n\nMr Smeaton's pump, when in good order, and perfectly free from all moisture, will in dry weather rarely excite two air about 600 times, raising the barometer-gage to new improvements.\nAir-pump in \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of an inch of a fine barometer. This was a performance so much superior to that of all others, and by means of Mr Nairne's experiments opened to new a field of observation, that the air-pump once more became a capital instrument among the experimental philosophers. The causes of its superiority were also so different, that artists were immediately excited to a farther improvement of the machine; so that this becomes a new epoch in its history.\n\nThere is one imperfection which Mr Smeaton has not attempted to remove. The discharging valve is still open against the pressure of the atmosphere. An author of the Swedish academy adds a subsidiary pump to this valve, which exhausts the air from above it, and thus puts it in the situation of the piston valve. We do not find that this improvement has been adopted so as to become general. Indeed the quantity of air which remains in the passage to this valve is so exceedingly little, that it does not seem to merit attention. Supposing the valve hole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch wide and as deep (and it need not be more), it will not occupy more than \\( \\frac{1}{300} \\) part of a barrel twelve inches long and two inches wide.\n\nMr Smeaton, by his ingenious construction, has greatly diminished, but has not annihilated, the obstructions to the passage of the air from the receiver into the barrel. His success encouraged farther attempts. One of the first and most ingenious was that of Professor Ruffel of the university of Edinburgh, who about the year 1770 constructed a pump in which both cocks and valves were avoided.\n\nThe piston is solid, as represented in fig. 28, and its rod passes through a collar of leather on the top of the barrel. This collar is divided into three portions by two brass rings \\( a, b \\), which leave a very small space round the piston rod. The upper ring \\( a \\) communicates by means of a lateral perforation with the bent tube \\( l m n \\), which enters the barrel at its middle \\( n \\). The lower ring \\( b \\) communicates with the bent tube \\( c d \\), which communicates with the horizontal passage \\( d c \\), going to the middle \\( e \\) of the pump plate. By the way, however, it communicates also with a barometer gage \\( p s \\), standing in a cistern of mercury \\( a \\), covered with a glass tube close at the top. Beyond \\( e \\), on the opposite circumference of the receiver plate, there is a cock or plug \\( f \\) communicating with the atmosphere.\n\nThe piston rod is closely embraced by the three collars of leather; but, as already said, has a free space round it in the two brass rings. To produce this pressure of the leathers to the rod, the brass rings which separate them are turned thinner on the inner side, so that their cross section along a diameter would be a taper wedge. In the side of the piston rod are two cavities \\( q r, t s \\), about one-tenth of an inch wide and deep, and of a length equal to the thickness of the two rings \\( a, b \\), and the intermediate collar of leathers. These cavities are so placed on the piston-rod, that when the piston is applied to the bottom of the barrel, the cavity \\( t s \\) in the upper end of the rod has its upper end opposite to the ring \\( a \\), and its lower end opposite to the ring \\( b \\), or to the mouth of the pipe \\( c d \\). Therefore, if there be a void in the barrel, the air from the receiver will come from the pipe \\( c d \\), into the cavity in the piston rod, and by it will get past the collar of leather between the rings, and thus will get into the small interstice between the rod and the upper ring, and then into the pipe \\( l m n \\), and Air-pump into the empty barrel. When the piston is drawn up, the solid rod immediately shuts up this passage, and the piston drives the air through the discharging valve \\( k \\). When it has reached the top of the barrel, and is closely applied to it, the cavity \\( q r \\) is in the situation in which it formerly was, and the communication is again opened between the receiver and the empty barrel, and the air is again diffused between them. Pushing down the piston expels the air by the lower discharging pipe and valve \\( h i \\); and thus the operation may be continued.\n\nThis must be acknowledged to be a most simple and ingenious construction, and can neither be called a hack nor a valve. It seems to oppose no obstruction whatever; and it has the superior advantage of rarely being during the ascent and the descent of the piston, doubling the expedition of the performance, and the operator is not opposed by the pressure of the atmosphere except towards the end of each stroke. The expedition, however, is not so great as one should expect; for nothing is going on while the piston is in motion, and the operator must stop a while at the end of each stroke, that the air may have time to come through this long, narrow, and crooked passage, to fill the barrel. But the chief difficulty which occurred in the execution arose from the clammy oil with which it was necessary to impregnate the collar of leathers. These were always in a state of strong compression, that they might closely grasp the piston rod, and prevent all passage of air during the motion of the piston. Whenever therefore the cavities in the piston rod come into the situations necessary for connecting the receiver and barrel, this oil is squeezed into them, and chokes them up. Hence it always happened that it was some time after the stroke before the air could force its way round the piston rod, carrying with it the clammy oil which choked up the tube \\( l m n \\); and when the rarefaction had proceeded a certain length, the diminished elasticity of the air was not able to make its way through these obstructions. The death of the ingenious author put a stop to the improvements by which he hoped to remedy this defect, and we have not heard that any other person has since attempted it. We have inferred it here, because its principle of construction is not only very ingenious, but entirely different from all others, and may furnish very useful hints to those who are much engaged in the construction of pneumatic engines.\n\nIn the 73rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, by Haas, Mr Tiberius Cavallo has given the description of an air-pump contrived and executed by Messrs Haas and Co. Hunter, instrument-makers in London, where these artists have revived Guericke's method of opening the barrel-valve during the last strokes of the pump by a force acting from without. We shall infer so much of this description as relates to this distinguishing circumstance of its construction.\n\nFig. 29 represents a section of the bottom of the barrel, where AA is the barrel and BB the bottom, which has in its middle a hollow cylinder CCFF, projecting about half an inch into the barrel at CC, and extending a good way downwards to FF. The space between this projection and the sides of the barrel is filled up by a brass ring DD, over the top of which is strained a piece of oiled silk EE, which performs the office of a valve, covering the hole CC. But this hole is filled up by a piece\nAir-pump piece of brass, or rather an assemblage of pieces screwed together GGHHII. It consists of three projecting fillets or shoulders GG, HH, II, which form two hollows between them, and which are filled with rings of oiled leather OO, PP, firmly screwed together. The extreme fillets GG, II, are of equal diameter with the inside of the cylinder, so as to fill it exactly, and the whole stuffed with oiled leather, slide up and down without allowing any air to pass. The middle fillet HH is not so broad, but thicker. In the upper fillet GG there is formed a shallow dish about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch deep and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) wide. This dish is covered with a thin plate, pierced with a grating like Mr Smeaton's valve-plate. There is a perforation VX along the axis of this piece, which has a passage out at one side H, through the middle fillet. Opposite to this passage, and in the side of the cylinder CCFF, is a hole M, communicating with the conduit pipe MN, which leads to the receiver. Into the lower end of the perforation is screwed the pin KL, whose tail L passes through the cap FF. The tail L is connected with a lever RQ, moveable round the joint Q. This lever is pushed upwards by a spring, and thus the whole piece which we have been describing is kept in contact with the lip of oiled silk or valve EE. This is the usual situation of things.\n\nNow suppose a void formed in the barrel by drawing up the piston; the elasticity of the air in the receiver, in the pipe NM, and in the passage XV, will press on the great surface of the valve exposed through the grating, will raise it, and the pump will perform precisely as Mr Smeaton's does. But suppose the rarefaction to have been too long continued, that the air is no longer able to raise the valve; this will be seen by the mercury rising no more in the pump-gage. When this is perceived, the operator must press with his foot on the end R of the lever RQ. This draws down the pin KL, and with it the whole hollow plug with its grated top. And thus, instead of raising the valve from its plate, the plate is here drawn down from the valve. The air now gets in without any obstruction whatever, and the rarefaction proceeds as long as the piston rises. When it is at the top of the barrel, the operator takes his foot from the lever, and the spring presses up the plug again and shuts the valve. The piston rod passes through a collar of leather, as in Mr Smeaton's pump, and the air is finally discharged through an outward valve in the top of the barrel. These parts have nothing peculiar in them.\n\nThis is an ingenious contrivance, similar to what was adopted by Guericke himself; and we have no doubt of these pumps performing extremely well if carefully made; and it seems not difficult to keep the plug perfectly air-tight by supplying plenty of oil to the leathers. We cannot say, however, with precision what may be expected from it, as no account has been given of its effects besides what Mr Cavallo published in Philosophical Transactions 1783, where he only says, that when it had been long used, it had, in the course of some experiments, rarefied 690 times.\n\nAiming still at the removing the obstructions to the entry of the air from the receiver into the barrels, Mr Prince, as American, has constructed a pump in which there is no valve or cock whatever between them. In this pump the piston rod passes through a collar of leathers, and the air is finally discharged through a valve, as in the two last. But we are chiefly to attend, in this place, to the communication between the barrel and the Air-pump receiver. The barrel widens below into a sort of cistern ABCD (fig. 30.), communicating with the receiver by Fig. 32., the pipe EF. As soon, therefore, as the piston gets into this wider part, where there is a vacancy all round it, the air of the receiver expands freely through the passage FEE into the barrel, in which the descent of the piston had made a void. When the piston is again drawn up, as soon as it gets into the cylindric part of the barrel, which it exactly fills, it carries up the air before it, and expels it by the top valve; and, that this may be done more completely, this valve opens into a second barrel or air-pump whose piston is rising at the same time, and therefore the valve of communication (which is the discharging valve of the primary pump) opens with the same facility as Mr Smeaton's piston valve. While the piston is rising, the air in the receiver expands into the barrel; and when the piston descends, the air in the barrel again collapses till the piston gets again into the cistern, when the air passes out, and fills the evacuated barrel, to be expelled by the piston as before.\n\nNo distinct account has as yet been given of the performance of this pump. We only learn that great inconveniences were experienced from the oscillations of the mercury in the gage. As soon as the piston comes into the cistern, the air from the receiver immediately rushes into the barrel, and the mercury shoots up in the gage, and gets into a state of oscillation. The subsequent rise of the piston will frequently keep time with the second oscillation, and increase it. The descent of the piston produces a downward oscillation, by allowing the air below it to collapse; and, by improperly timing the strokes, this oscillation becomes so great as to make the mercury enter the pump. To prevent this, and a greater irregularity of working as a condenser, valves were put in the piston: but as these require force to open them, the addition seemed rather to increase the evil, by rendering the oscillations more simultaneous with the ordinary rate of working. If this could be got over, the construction seems very promising.\n\nIt appears, however, of very difficult execution. It has many long, slender, and crooked passages, which must be drilled through broad plates of brass, some of them appearing scarcely practicable. It is rare to find plates and other pieces of brass without air-holes, which it would be very difficult to find out and to close; and it must be very difficult to clear it of obstructions; so that it appears rather a suggestion of theory than a thing warranted by its actual performance.\n\nMr Lavoisier, or some of the naturalists who were by Lavoir occupied in concert with him in the investigation of the different species of gas which are disengaged from bodies in the course of chemical operations, has contrived an air-pump which has great appearance of simplicity, and, being very different from all others, deserves to be taken notice of.\n\nIt consists of two barrels l, m, fig. 31., with solid pistons k & l. The pump-plate a b is pierced at its centre c with a hole which branches towards each of the barrels, as represented by d, e, e. Between the plate and the barrels slides another plate h i, pierced in the middle with a branched hole f d g, and near the ends with two holes h i, i i, which go from its under side to the ends. The holes in these two plates are so adjusted, that when the plate h i is drawn so far towards h that the hole i comes within","sp":308,"ep":311},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Air-pump within the barrel \\( m \\), the branch \\( df \\) of the hole in the middle plate coincides with the branch \\( cd \\) of the upper plate, and the holes \\( e, g \\) are shut. Thus a communication is established between the barrel \\( l \\) and the receiver on the pump-plate, and between the barrel \\( m \\) and the external air. In this situation the barrel \\( l \\) will exhaust, and \\( m \\) will discharge. When the piston of \\( l \\) is at its mouth, and that of \\( m \\) touches its bottom, the sliding plate is shifted over to the other side, so that \\( m \\) communicates with the receiver through the passage \\( gd \\), etc., and \\( l \\) communicates with the air by the passages \\( h, h \\).\n\nIt is evident that this sliding plate performs the office of four cocks in a very beautiful and simple manner, and that if the pistons apply close to the ends of the barrels, so as to expel the whole air, the pump will be perfect. It works, indeed, against the whole pressure of the external air. But this may be avoided by putting valves on the holes \\( h, i \\); and these can do no harm, because the air remaining in them never gets back into the barrel till the piston be at the farther end, and the exhaustion of that stroke completed. But the best workmen of London think that it will be incomparably more difficult to execute this cock (for it is a cock of an unusual form), in such a manner that it shall be air-tight and yet move with tolerable ease, and that it is much more liable to wearing loose than common cocks. No accurate accounts have been received of its performance. It must be acknowledged to be ingenious, and it may suggest to an intelligent artist a method of combining common conical cocks upon one axis so as to answer the same purpose much more effectually; for which reason we have inserted it here.\n\nThe last improvement which we shall mention is that published by Mr Cuthbertson philosophical instrument-maker in Amsterdam. His pump has given such evidences of its perfection, that we can hardly expect or wish for any thing more complete. But we must be allowed to observe, beforehand, that the same construction was invented, and, in part, executed before the end of 1779, by Dr Daniel Rutherford, now professor of botany in the university of Edinburgh, who was at that time engaged in experiments on the production of air during the combustion of bodies in contact with nitre, and who was vastly desirous of procuring a more complete abstraction of pure aerial matter than could be effected by Mr Smeaton's pump. The compiler of this article had then an opportunity of perusing the Doctor's dissertation on this subject, which was read in the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh. In this dissertation the Doctor appears fully apprised of the existence of pure vital air in the nitrous acid, as its chief ingredient, and as the cause of its most remarkable phenomena, and to want but a step to the discoveries which have enabled the name of Mr Lavoirier. He was particularly anxious to obtain apart this distinguishing ingredient in its composition, and, for this purpose, to abstract completely from the vessel in which he subjected it to examination, every particle of elastic matter. The writer of this article proposed to him to cover the bottom of Mr Smeaton's piston with some clammy matter, which should take hold of the bottom valve, and start it when the piston was drawn up. A few days after, the Doctor showed him a drawing of a pump, having a conical metal valve in the bottom, furnished with a long slender wire, sliding in the inside of the piston-rod with a gentle friction, sufficient for lifting the valve, and secured against all chance of failure by a spring atop, which took hold of a notch in the inside of the piston-rod about a quarter of an inch from the lower end, so as certainly to lift the valve during the last quarter of an inch of the piston's motion. Being an excellent mechanic, he had executed a valve on this principle, and was fully satisfied with its performance. But having already confirmed his doctrines respecting the nitrous acid by incontrovertible experiments, his wishes to improve the air-pump lost their incitement, and he thought no more of it; and not long after this, the ardour of the philosophers of the Teylerian Society at Haarlem and Amsterdam excited the efforts of Mr Cuthbertson, their instrument-maker, to the same purpose, and produced the most perfect air-pump that has yet appeared. We shall give a description of it, and an account of its performance, in the inventor's own words.\n\nCUTHBERTSON'S Air-Pump.\n\nOn Plate CCCCXXVII. fig. 32. is a perspective view of this pump, with its two principal gages screwed into Fig. 32. their places. These need not be used together, except in cases where the utmost exactness is required. In common experiments one of them is removed, and a stop-screw put in its place. When the pear-gage is used, a small round plate, on which the receiver may stand, must be first screwed into the hole at \\( A \\); but this hole is flopped on other occasions with a screw. When all the three gages are used, and the receiver is exhausted, the stop-screw \\( B \\), at the bottom of the pump, must be unscrewed, to admit the air into the receiver; but when they are not all used, either of the other stop-screws will answer this purpose.\n\nFig. 33. represents a cross-bar for preventing the barrels from being shaken by working the pump or by any accident. Its place in fig. 32. is represented by the dotted lines. It is confined in its place, and kept close down on the barrels, by two slips of wood \\( NN \\), which must be drawn out, as well as the screws \\( OO \\), when the pump is to be taken asunder.\n\nPlate CCCCXXVIII. exhibits a section of all the working parts of the pump, except the wheel and rack, in which there is nothing uncommon.\n\nFig. 34. is a section of one of the barrels, with all its internal parts; and figs. 35. 36. 37. and 38. are different parts of the piston, proportioned to the size of the barrel (\\( A \\)) and to one another.\n\nIn fig. 34. CD represents the barrel, \\( F \\) the collar of Fig. 34. leathers, \\( G \\) a hollow cylindrical vessel to contain oil, \\( R \\) is also an oil-vessel to receive the oil which is drawn, along with the air, through the hole \\( a \\), when the piston is drawn upwards; and, when this is full, the oil is carried over with the air, along the tube \\( T \\), into the oil-vessel \\( G \\). \\( cc \\) is a wire which is driven upwards from the\n\n(A) The piston and barrel are 1.65 inches in diameter, in proportion to which the scale is drawn. Figures 35. 36. 37. and 38. are, however, of double size.\nAir-pump, the hole \\(aa\\) by the passage of the air; and as soon as this has escaped, it falls down again by its own weight, flutes up the hole, and prevents all return of the air into the barrel. At \\(dd\\) are fixed two pieces of brass, to keep the wire \\(cc\\) in a vertical direction, that it may accurately flute the hole. \\(H\\) is a cylindrical wire or rod which carries the piston \\(I\\), and is made hollow to receive a long wire \\(gg\\), which opens and flutes the hole \\(L\\); and on the other end of the wire \\(O\\) is screwed a nut, which, by stopping in the narrowest part of the hole, prevents the wire from being driven up too far. This wire and screw are more clearly seen in fig. 35. and 39.; they slide in a collar of leather \\(rr\\), fig. 35. and 38., in the middle piece of the piston. Fig. 37. and 38. are the two main parts which compose the piston, and, when the pieces 36. and 39. are added to it, the whole is represented by fig. 35. Fig. 38. is a piece of brass of a conical form, with a shoulder at the bottom. A long hollow screw is cut in it, about two-thirds of its length, and the remainder of the hole, in which there is no screw, is of about the same diameter with the screwed part, except a thin plate at the end, which is of a width exactly equal to the thickness of \\(gg\\). That part of the inside of the conical brass in which no thread is cut, is filled with oiled leathers with holes through which \\(gg\\) can slide freely. There is also a male screw with a hole in it, fitted to \\(gg\\), serving to compress the leathers \\(rr\\).\n\nIn fig. 37. \\(aaaa\\) is the outside of the piston, the inside of which is turned so as exactly to fit the outside of fig. 38. \\(bb\\) are round leathers about 60 in number, \\(cc\\) is a circular piece of brass of the size of the leathers, and \\(dd\\) is a screw fitting to compress them. The screw at the end of fig. 36. is made to fit the screw in fig. 38. Now if fig. 39. be pushed into fig. 38., this into fig. 37. and fig. 36. be screwed into the end of fig. 38., these will compose the whole of the piston, as represented in fig. 34. In fig. 34. represents the same part as \\(H\\) in fig. 35. and is that to which the rack is fixed. If, therefore, this be drawn upwards, it will cause fig. 38. to flute close into fig. 37. and drive out the air above it; and when it is pushed downward, it will open as far as the shoulder \\(aa\\) will permit, and suffer air to pass through.\n\n\\(AA\\), fig. 40. is the receiver plate, \\(BB\\) is a long square piece of brass, screwed into the under side of the plate, through which a hole is drilled corresponding to that in the centre of the receiver-plates and with three female screws \\(b, b, c\\).\n\nThe rarefaction of the air in the receiver is effected as follows. Suppose the piston at the bottom of the barrel. The inside of the barrel, from the top of the piston to \\(a\\), fig. 34. contains common air. When the rod is drawn up, the upper part of the piston sticks fast in the barrel till the conical part connected with the rod flutes the conical hole, and its shoulder applies close to its bottom. The piston is now fluted, and therefore the whole is drawn up by the rack-work, driving the air before it through the hole \\(ae\\), into the oil-pannel at \\(R\\), and out into the room by the tube \\(T\\). The piston will then be at the top of the barrel at \\(a\\), and the wire \\(gg\\) will stand nearly as represented in the figure just raised from the hole \\(L\\), and prevented from rising higher by the nut \\(O\\). During this motion the air will expand in the receiver, and come along the bent tube \\(m\\) into the barrel. Thus the barrel will be filled with air, which, as the piston rises, will be rarefied in proportion as the capacity of the receiver, pipes, and barrel, is to the barrel alone. When the piston is moved down again by the rack-work, it will force the conical part fig. 38. out of the hollow part fig. 37. as far as the shoulders \\(aa\\); fig. 35. will rest on \\(aa\\) fig. 37. which will then be so far open as to permit the air to pass freely through it, while at the same time the end of \\(gg\\) is forced against the top of the hole, and flutes it in order to prevent any air from returning into the receiver. Thus the piston, moving downwards, suffers the air to pass out between the sides of fig. 37. and 38.; and, when it is at the bottom of the barrel, will have the column of air above it; and, consequently, when drawn upwards it will flute, and drive out this air, and, by opening the hole \\(L\\) at the same time, will give a free passage to more air from the receiver. This process being continued, the air of the receiver will be rarefied as far as its expansive power will permit. For in this machine there are no valves to be forced open by the elasticity of the air in the receiver, which at last is unable to effect. There is therefore nothing to prevent the air from expanding to its utmost degree.\n\nIt may be suspected here, that as the air must escape through the discharging passage \\(ac\\), fig. 34. against the pressure of a column of oil and the weight of the wire, there will remain in this passage a quantity of air of considerable density, which will expand again into the barrel during the descent of the piston, and thus put a stop to the progress of rarefaction. This is the case in Mr Smeaton's pump, and all which have valves in the piston. But it is the peculiar excellency of this pump, that whatever be the density of the air remaining in \\(ac\\), the rarefaction will still go on. It is worth while to be perfectly convinced of this. Let us suppose that the air contained in \\(ac\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\)th part of the common air which would fill the barrel, and that the capacity of the barrel is equal to that of the receiver and passages, and that the air in the receiver and barrel is of the same density, the piston being at the bottom of the barrel: The barrel will therefore contain \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) parts of its natural quantity, and the receiver \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\). Now let the piston be drawn up. No air will be discharged at \\(ac\\), because it will contain the whole air which was in the barrel, and which has now collapsed into its ordinary bulk. But this does not in the least hinder the air of the receiver from expanding into the barrel, and diffusing itself equally between both. Each will now contain \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) of their ordinary quantity when the piston is at the top, and \\(ac\\) will contain \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) as before, or \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\). Now push down the piston. The hole \\(L\\) is instantly fluted, and the air in \\(ac\\) expands into the barrel, and the barrel now contains \\(\\frac{2}{100}\\). When the piston has reached the bottom, let it be again drawn up. There will be \\(\\frac{2}{100}\\) discharged through \\(c\\), and the air in the receiver will again be equally distributed between it and the barrel. Therefore the receiver will now contain \\(\\frac{2}{100}\\). When the piston reaches the bottom, there will be \\(\\frac{12}{100}\\) in the barrel. When again drawn up to the top, there will be \\(\\frac{2}{100}\\) discharged, and the receiver will contain \\(\\frac{14}{100}\\); and when the piston reaches\nreaches the bottom, there will be $\\frac{11}{1000}$. At the next stroke the receiver will contain only $\\frac{9}{1000}$, &c. &c.\n\nThus it appears, that notwithstanding the $\\frac{1}{1000}$ which always expands back again out of the hole $a c$ into the barrel, the rarity of the air in the receiver will be doubled at every stroke. There is therefore no need of a subsidiary air-pump at $c$, as in the American air-pump, and in the Swedish attempt to improve Smeaton's.\n\nIn using this air-pump no particular directions are necessary, nor is any peculiar care necessary for keeping it in order, except that the oil-veevel $A$ be always kept about half full of oil. When the pump has stood long without being used, it will be proper to draw a tablespoonful of olive-oil through it, by pouring it into the hole in the middle of the receiver-plate when the piston is at the bottom of the barrel. Then by working the piston, the oil will be drawn through all the parts of the pump, and the surplus will be driven through the tube $T$ into the oil-veevel $G$. Near the top of the piston-rod at $H$ there is a hole which lets some oil into the inside of the rod, which gets at the collar of leathers $r r$, and keeps the wire $g g$ air-tight.\n\nWhen the pump is used for condensation at the same time that it rarefies, or separately, the piece containing the bent tube $T$ must be removed, and fig. 41. put into its place, and fixed by its screws. Fig. 41., as drawn in the plate, is intended for a double-barrelled pump. But for a single barrel only one piece is used, represented by $b a a$, the double piece being cut off at the dotted line $a a$. In this piece is a female screw to receive the end of a long brass tube, to which a bladder (if sufficient for the experiment of condensation), or a glass, properly secured for this purpose, must be screwed. Then the air which is abstracted from the receiver on the pump-plate will be forced into the bladder or glass. But if the pump be double, the apparatus fig. 41. is used, and the long brass tube screwed on at $c$.\n\nFig. 42. and 43. represent the two gages, which will be sufficiently explained afterwards. Fig. 42. is screwed into $c b$, or into the screw at the other end of $c$ fig. 42. and fig. 43. into the screw $a b$ fig. 42.\n\nIf it be used as a single pump, either to rarefy or condense, the screw $K$, which fastens the rack to the piston-rod $H$, must be taken out. Then turning the winch till $H$ is depressed as low as possible, the machine will be fitted to exhaust as a single pump; and if it be required to condense, the direction in No. 8. must be observed with regard to the tube $T$, and fig. 41.\n\n\"I took (says Mr Cuthbertson) two barometer-tubes of an equal bore with that fixed to the pump. These were filled with mercury four times boiled. They were then compared, and stood exactly at the same height. The mercury in one of them was boiled in it four times more, without making any change in their height; they were therefore judged very perfect. One of these was immersed in the cistern of the pump-gage, and fastened in a position parallel to it, and a sliding scale of one inch was attached to it. This scale, when the gage is used, must have its upper edge set equal with the surface of the mercury in the boiled tube after exhaustion, and the difference between the height of the mercury in this and in the other barometer tube may be observed to the $\\frac{1}{1000}$ of an inch; and being close together, no error arises from their not being exactly vertical, if they are only parallel. This gage will be better understood by inspecting fig. 43.\n\n\"I used a second gage, which I shall call a double syphon. See fig. 42. This was also prepared with the utmost care. I had a scale for measuring the difference between the height of the columns in the two legs. It was an inch long, and divided as the former, and kept in a truly vertical position by suspending it from a point with a weight hung to it, as represented in the figure. Upon comparing these two gages, I always found them to indicate the same degree of rarefaction. I also used a pear-gage, though the most imperfect of all, in order to repeat the curious experiments of Mr Nairne and others.\"\n\nWhen experiments require the utmost rarefying power of the pump, the receiver must not be placed on leather, either oiled or soaked in water, as is usually done. The pump-plate and the edge of the receiver must be ground very flat and true, and this with very fine emery, that no roughness may remain. The plate of the pump must then be wiped very clean and very dry, and the receiver rubbed with a warm cloth till it become electrical. The receiver being now set on the plate, hog's lard, either alone or mixed with a little oil, which has been cleared of water by boiling, must be smeared round its outside edge. In this condition the pump will rarefy its utmost, and what still remains in the receiver will be permanent air. Or a little of this composition may be thinly smeared on the pump-plate; this will prevent all risk of scratching it with the edge of the receiver. Leather of very uniform thickness, long dried before a fire, and well soaked in this composition, which must be cleared of all water by the first boiling, will answer very well, and is expedient, when receivers are to be frequently shifted. Other leathers should be at hand soaked in a composition containing a little rosin. This gives it a clamminess which renders it impermeable to air, and is very proper at all joints of the pump, and all apparatus for pneumatic experiments. As it is impossible to render the pear-gage as dry as other parts of the apparatus, there will be generally some variation between this and the other gages.\n\nWhen it is only intended to show the utmost power of the pump, without intending to ascertain the quality of the residuum, the receiver may be set on wet leather. If, in this condition, the air be rarefied as far as possible, the syphon and barometer gage will indicate a less degree of rarefaction than in the former experiments. But when the air is let in again, the pear-gage will point out a rarefaction some thousands of times greater than it did before. If the true quality of permanent air after exhaustion be required, the pear-gage will be nearest the truth: for when the air is rarefied to a certain degree, the moistened leather emits an expandible fluid, which, filling the receiver, forces out the permanent air; and the two first gages indicate a degree of exhaustion which relates to the whole elastic matter remaining in the receiver, viz. to the expandible fluid together with the permanent air; whereas the pear-gage points out the degree of exhaustion, with relation...\nAir-pump relation to the permanent air alone, which remains in the receiver; for by the pressure of the air admitted into the receiver, the elastic vapour is reduced to its former bulk, which is imperceptible.\n\nMany bodies emit this elastic fluid when the pressure of the air is much diminished; a piece of leather, in its ordinary damp state, about an inch square, or a bit of green or dry wood, will supply this for a great while.\n\nWhen such fluids have been generated in any experiments, the pump must be carefully cleared of them, for they remain not only in the receiver, but in the barrels and passages, and will again expand when the exhaustion has been carried far.\n\nThe best method of clearing the pump is to take a very large receiver, and, using every precaution to exhaust it as far as possible. Then the expulsive matter lurking in the barrels and passages will be diffused through the receiver also, or will be carried off along with its air. It will be as much rarer than it was before, as the aggregate capacity of the receiver barrels and passages is larger than that of the two last.\n\nThe performance of the pump may be judged of from the four following experiments.\n\nThe two gages being screwed into their places, and the hole in the receiver-plate shut up, the pump was made to exhaust as far as it could. The mercury in the legs of the syphon was only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch out of the level, and that in the boiled barometer-tube \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of an inch higher than in the one screwed to the pump. A standard barometer then stood at 30 inches, and therefore the pump rarefied the permanent air 1200 times. This is twice as much as Mr Nairne found Mr Smeaton's do in his best state. Mr Cavallo seems disposed to give a favourable (while we must suppose it a just) account of Haas and Hurter's pump, and it appears never to have exceeded 600 times. Mr Cuthbertson has often found the mercury within \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch of the level in the syphon-gage, indicating a rarefaction of 3000.\n\nTo one end of a glass tube, 2 inches diameter and 30 inches long, was fitted a brass cap and collar of leather, through which a wire was inserted, reaching about two inches within the tube. This was connected with the conductor of an electric machine. The other end was ground flat and set on the pump plate. When the gages indicated a rarefaction of 3000, the light became steady and uniform, of a pale colour, though a little tinged with purple; at 600 the light was of a pale dusty white; when 1200 it disappeared in the middle of the tube, and the tube conducted so well that the prime conductor only gave sparks so faint and short as to be scarcely perceptible. After taking off the tube, and making it as dry as possible, it was again connected with the conductor, which was giving sparks two inches long. When the air in it was rarefied ten times, the sparks were of the same length. Sometimes a pencil of light darted along the tube. When the rarefaction was 229, the spark did not exceed an inch, and light streamed the whole length of the tube. When the rarefaction was 300, the sparks were half an inch, and the light rushed along the tube in great streams. When the rarefaction was 100, the sparks were about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) long, and the light filled the tube in an uninterrupted body. When 300, the appearances were as before. When 600, the sparks were \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the light was of a faint white colour in the middle, but tinged with purple toward the ends. When 1200, the light was hardly perceptible in the middle, and was much fainter at the ends than before, but still ruddy. When 1400, which was the most the pump could produce, six inches of the middle of the tube were quite dark, and the ends free of any tinge of red, and the sparks did not exceed \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch.\n\nWe trust that our readers will not be displeased with the preceding history of the air-pump. The occasional improvements which it gives will be of great use to every person much engaged in pneumatic experiments, and may help him in the contrivance and construction of the necessary apparatus.\n\nWe may be indulged in one remark, that although this noble instrument originated in Germany, all its improvements were made in this kingdom. Both the mechanical and pneumatic principles of Mr Boyle's construction were extremely different from the German, and, in respect of expedition and convenience, much superior. The double barrel and gage by Hawkeye were capital improvements, and on principle; and Mr Smeaton's method of making the piston work in rarefied air made a complete change in the whole process.\n\nAided by this machine, we can make experiments Utility of establishing and illustrating the gravity and elasticity of the air, in a much more perspicuous manner than could pump. It allows us in the first place to show the materiality Experiments of air in a very distinct manner. Bodies cannot move about in the atmosphere without displacing it. This shows this requires force; and the resistance of the air always diminishes the velocity of bodies moving in it. A heavy body therefore has the velocity of its fall diminished; and if the quantity of air displaced be very great, the diminution will be very considerable. This is the reason why light bodies, such as feathers, fall very slowly. Their moving force is very small, and can therefore displace a great quantity of air only with a very small velocity. But if the same body be dropped in vacuo, when there is no air to be displaced, it falls with the whole velocity competent to its gravity. Fig. 44 represents an apparatus by which a guinea and a downy feather are dropped at the same instant, by opening the forceps which holds them by means of the clip-wire in the top of the receiver. If this be done after the air has been pumped out, the guinea and the feather will be observed to reach the bottom at the same instant.\n\nFig. 45 represents another apparatus for showing the same thing. It consists of two sets of brass vanes put Fig. 45. in separate axles, in the manner of windmill sails. One set has their edges placed in the direction of their whirling motion, that is, in a plane to which the axis is perpendicular. The planes of the other set pass through the axis, and they are therefore trimmed so as directly to face the air through which they move. Two springs act upon pins projecting from the axis; and their strength or tensions are so adjusted, that when they are disengaged in vacuo, the two sets continue in motion equally long. If they are disengaged in the air, the vanes which beat the air with their planes will flop long before those which cut it edgewise.\n\nWe can now abstract the air most completely from\nAir-pump, a dry vessel, so as to know the precise weight of the air which filled it. The first experiment we have of this kind, done with accuracy, is that of Dr Hooke, February 10, 1664, when he found 114 pints of air to weigh 945 grains. One pint of water was 8\u00bd ounces. This gives for the specific gravity of air \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) very nearly.\n\nSince we are thus immersed in a gravitating fluid, it follows, that every body preponderates only with the excess of its own weight above that of the air which it displaces; for every body loses by this immersion the weight of the displaced air. A cubic foot loses about 521 grains in frosty weather. We see balloons even rise in the air, as a piece of cork rises in water. A mass of water which really contains 850 pounds will load the scale of a balance with 849 only, and will be balanced by about 849\u00bd pounds of brass. This is convinced by a very pretty experiment, represented in fig. 46. A small beam is suspended within a receiver. To one end of the beam is appended a thin glass or copper ball, close in every part. This is balanced by a small piece of lead hung on the other arm. As the air is pumped out of the receiver, the ball will gradually preponderate, and will regain its equilibrium when the air is re-admitted.\n\nSome naturalists have proposed, and actually used, a large globe of light make, suspended at a beam, for a barometer. If its capacity be a cubic foot, 1\u00bd grains will indicate the same change that is indicated by \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch of an ordinary barometer. But a vessel of this size will load a balance too much to leave it sufficiently sensible to small changes of density. Besides, it is affected by heat and cold, and would require a very troublesome equation to correct their effects.\n\nIt may perhaps be worth while to attend to this in buying and selling precious commodities; such as pearls, diamonds, silk, and some drugs. As they are generally sold by brass or leaden weights, the buyer will have some advantage when the air is heavy and the barometer high. On the other hand, he will have the advantage in buying gold and mercury when the air is light. It is needless to confine this observation to precious commodities, for the advantage is the same in all in proportion to their levity.\n\nThere is a case in which this observation is of consequence to the philosopher: we mean the measuring of time by pendulums. As the accelerating force on a pendulum is not its whole weight, but the excess of its weight over that of the displaced air, it follows that a pendulum will vibrate more slowly in the air than in vacuo. A pendulum composed of lead, iron, and brass, may be about 8400 times heavier than the air which it displaces when the barometer is at 30 inches and the thermometer at 32\u00b0, and the accelerating force will be diminished about \\( \\frac{1}{850} \\). This will cause a second pendulum to make about five vibrations less in a day than it would do in vacuo. In order therefore to deduce the accelerative power of gravity from the length of a pendulum vibrating in the air, we must make an allowance of 0.17, or \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of a second, per day for every inch that the barometer stands lower than 30 inches. But we must also note the temperature of the air; because when the air is warm it is less dense when supporting by its elasticity the same weight of atmosphere, and we must know how much its density is diminished by an increase of temperature. The correction is still more complicated; for the change of density affects the refraction of the air, and this affects the time of the vibration, and this by a law that is not yet well ascertained. As far as we can determine from any experiments that have been made, it appears that the change arising from the altered refraction takes off about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the change produced by the altered density, and that a second pendulum makes but three vibrations a day more in vacuo than in the open air. This is a very unexpected result; but it must be owned that the experiments have neither been numerous nor very nicely made.\n\nThe air-pump also allows us to show the effects of the air's pressure in a great number of amusing and instructive phenomena.\n\nWhen the air is abstracted from the receiver, it is strongly pressed to the pump-plate by the incumbent strata of the atmosphere, and it supports this great pressure in consequence of its circular form. Being equally compressed the air's on all sides, there is no place where it should give way preferentially rather than another; but if it be thin, and not very round, which is sometimes the case, it will be crushed to pieces. If we take a square thin phial, and apply an exhausting syringe to its mouth, it will not fail being crushed.\n\nAs the operation of pumping is something like sucking, many of these phenomena are in common discourse ascribed to suction, a word much abused; and this abuse misleads the mind exceedingly in its contemplation of natural phenomena. Nothing is more usual than to speak of the suction of a syringe, the suction and draught of a chimney, &c. The following experiment puts the true cause of the strong adhesion of the receiver beyond a doubt.\n\nPlace a small receiver or cupping-glas on the pump-plate without covering the central hole, as represented in fig. 47, and cover it with a larger receiver. Exhaust the air from it; then admit it as suddenly as possible. The outer receiver, which after the rarefaction adhered strongly to the plate, is now loose, and the cupping-glas will be found sticking fast to it. While the rarefaction was going on, the air in the small receiver also expanded, escaped from it, and was abstracted by the pump. When the external air was suddenly admitted, it pressed on the small receiver, and forced it down to the plate, and thus shut up all entry. The small receiver must now adhere; and there can be no suction, for the pipe of the pump was on the outside of the cupping-glas.\n\nThis experiment sometimes does not succeed, because the air sometimes finds a passage under the brim of the cupping-glas. But if the cupping-glas be pressed down by the hand on the greasy leather or plate, everything will be made smooth, and the glas will be so little raised by the expansion of its air during the pumping, that it will instantly clap close when the air is re-admitted.\n\nIn like manner, if a thin square phial be furnished with a valve, opening from within, but shutting when pressed from without, and if this phial be put under a receiver, and the air be abstracted from the receiver, the air in the phial will expand during the rarefaction, will escape through the valve, and be at last in a very rarefied state within\nAir-pump within the phial. If the air be now admitted into the receiver, it will press on the flat sides of the included phial and crush it to pieces. See fig. 48.\n\nIf a piece of wet ox-bladder be laid over the top of a receiver whose orifice is about four inches wide, and the air be exhausted from within it, the incumbent atmosphere will press down the bladder into a hollow form, and then burst it inward with a prodigious noise. See fig. 49.\n\nOr if a piece of thin flat glass be laid over the receiver, with an oiled leather between them to make the juncture air-tight, the glass will be broken downwards. This must be done with caution, because the pieces of glass sometimes fly about with great force.\n\nIf there be formed two hemispherical cups of brass, with very flat thick brims, and one of them be fitted with a neck and stopcock, as represented by fig. 50, the air may be abstracted from them by screwing the neck into the hole in the pump-plate. To prevent the infiltration of air, a ring of oiled leather may be put between the rims. Now uncrew the sphere from the pump, and fix hooks to each, and suspend them from a strong nail, and hang a scale to the lowest. It will require a considerable weight to separate them; namely, about 15 pounds for every square inch of the great circle of the sphere. If this be four inches diameter, it will require near 190 pounds. This pretty experiment was first made by Otto Guericke, and on a very great scale. His sphere was of a large size, and when exhausted the hemispheres could not be drawn abunder by 20 horses. It was exhibited, along with many others equally curious and magnificent, to the emperor of Germany and his court, at the breaking up of the diet of Ratibor in 1654.\n\nIf the loaded syringe mentioned in No. 16 be suspended by its piston from the hook in the top plate of the receiver, as in fig. 51, and the air be abstracted by the pump, the syringe will gradually descend (because the elasticity of the air, which formerly balanced the pressure of the atmosphere, is now diminished by its expansion, and is therefore no longer able to press the syringe to the piston), and it will at last drop off. If the air be admitted before this happens, the syringe will immediately rise again.\n\nScrew a short brass pipe into the neck of a transporter, No. 107, on which is set a tall receiver, and immerse it into a cistern of water. On opening the cock the pressure of the air on the surface of the water in the cistern will force it up through the pipe, and cause it to spout into the receiver with a strong jet, because there is no air within to balance by its elasticity the pressure of the atmosphere. See fig. 52.\n\nIt is in the same way that the gage of the air-pump performs its office. The pressure of the atmosphere raises the mercury in the gage till the weight of the mercury, together with the remaining elasticity of the air in the receiver, are in equilibrium with the whole pressure of the atmosphere; therefore the height and weight of the mercury in the gage is the excess of the weight of the atmosphere above the elasticity of the included air; and the deficiency of this height from that of the mercury in the Toricellian tube is the measure of this remaining elasticity.\n\nIf a Toricellian tube be put under a tall receiver, as shown in fig. 53, and the air be exhausted, the mercury in the tube will descend while that in the gage will rise; and the sum of their heights will always be the same, that is, equal to the height in an ordinary barometer.\n\nThe height of the mercury in the receiver is the effect and measure of the remaining elasticity of the included air, and the height in the pump-gage is the unbalanced pressure of the atmosphere. This is a very instructive experiment, perfectly similar to Mr. Auzout's, mentioned in No. 34, and completely establishes and illustrates the whole doctrine of atmospheric pressure.\n\nWe get a similar illustration and confirmation (if such Water rises a thing be new needed) of the cause of the rise of water in pumps, in pumps, by screwing a syringe into the top plate of a receiver, which syringe has a short glass pipe plunging into a small cup of water. See fig. 54. When the piston-rod is drawn up, the water rises in the glass pipe, as in any other pump, of which this is a miniature representation. But if the air has been previously exhausted from the receiver, there is nothing to press on the water in the little jar; and it will not rise in the glass pipe though the piston of the syringe be drawn to the top.\n\nAnalogous to the rise of water in pumps is its rise and motion in syphons. Suppose a pipe ABCD, fig. 55, bent at right angles at B and C, and having its two ends immersed in the cisterns of water A and D. Let the leg CD be longer than the leg BA, and let the whole be full of water. The water is pressed upwards at A with a force equal to the weight of the column of air E reaching to the top of the atmosphere; but it is pressed downwards by the weight of the column of water BA. The water at E is pressed downwards by the weight of the column CD, and upwards by the weight of the column of air FD reaching to the top of the atmosphere. The two columns of air differ very little in their weight, and may without any sensible error be considered as equal. Therefore there is a superiority of pressure downwards at D, and the water will flow out there. The pressure of the air will raise the water in the leg AB, and thus the stream will be kept up till the vessel A is emptied as low as the orifice of the leg BA, provided the height of AB is not greater than what the pressure of the atmosphere can balance, that is, does not exceed 32 or 33 feet for water, 30 inches for mercury, &c.\n\nA syphon then will always run from that vessel whose surface is highest; the form of the pipe is indifferent, because the hydrostatical pressures depend on the vertical height only. It must be filled with water by some other contrivance, such as a funnel, or a pump applied at top; and the funnel must be stopped up, otherwise the air would get in, and the water would fall in both legs.\n\nIf the syphon have equal legs, as in fig. 56, and be turned up at the ends, it will remain full of water, and be ready for use. It need only be dipped into any vessel of water, and the water will then flow out at the other end of the syphon. This is called the W\u00fcrtemberg syphon, and is represented in fig. 56. Syphons will afterwards be considered more minutely under the title of PNEUMATICAL Engines, at the end of this article.\n\nWhat is called the syphon fountain, constructed on this principle, is shown in fig. 57, where AB is a tall receiver, standing in a wide basin DE, which is supported on the pedestal H by the hollow pillar FG. In the centre of the receiver is a jet pipe C, and in the top a ground-stopper A. Near the base of the pillar is a cock N, and in the pedestal is another cock O.\nFill the basin DE with water within half an inch of the brim. Then pour in water at the top of the receiver (the cock N being shut) till it is about half full, and then put in the stopper. A little water will run out into the vessel DE. But before it runs over, open the cock N, and the water will run into the cistern H; and by the time that the pipe C appears above water, a jet will rise from it, and continue as long as water is supplied from the basin DE. The passage into the base cistern may be so tempered by the cock N that the water within the receiver shall keep at the same height, and what runs into the base may be received from the cock O into another vessel, and returned into DE, to keep up the stream.\n\nThis pretty philosophical toy may be constructed in the following manner. BB, fig. 58, is the ferril or cap into which the receiver is cemented. From its centre descends the jet pipe Ca, sloping outwards, to give room for the discharging pipe bd of larger diameter, whose lower extremity d fits tightly into the top of the hollow pillar FG.\n\nThe operation of the toy is easily understood. Suppose the distance from C to H (fig. 57) three feet, which is about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the height at which the atmosphere would support a column of water. The water poured into AB would descend through FG (the hole A being shut) till the air has expanded \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and then it would stop. If the pipe Ca be now opened, the pressure of the air on the surface of the water in the cistern DE will cause it to spout through C to the height of three feet nearly, and the water will continue to descend through the pipe FG. By tempering the cock N so as to allow the water to pass through it as fast as it is supplied by the jet, the amusement may be continued a long time. It will stop at last, however; because, as the jet is made into rarefied air, a little air will be extracted from the water, which will gradually accumulate in the receiver, and diminish its rarefaction, which is the moving cause of the jet. This indeed is an inconvenience felt in every employment of syphons, so much the more remarkably as their top is higher than the surface of the water in the cistern of supply.\n\nCases of this employment of a syphon are not frequent. When water collected at A (fig. 59) is to be conducted in a pipe to C, situated in a lower part of the country, it sometimes happens, as between Lochend and Leith, that the intervening ground is higher than the fountain-head as at B. A forcing pump is erected at A, and the water forced along the pipe. Once it runs out at C, the pump may be removed, and the water will continue to run on the syphon principle, provided BD do not exceed 33 feet. But the water in that part of the conduit which is above the horizontal plane AD, is in the same state as in a receiver of rarefied air, and gives out some of the air which is chemically united with it. This gradually accumulates in the elevated part of the conduit, and at last chokes it entirely. When this happens, the forcing pump must again be worked. Although the elevation in the Leith conduit is only about eight or ten feet, it will seldom run for 12 hours. N.B. This air cannot be discharged by the usual air-locks; for if there were an opening at B, the air would rush in, and immediately stop the motion.","sp":311,"ep":318},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Let \\( e b \\), and let \\( e c \\) be the height of the mercury in the barometer. Let this apparatus be set under a tubulated receiver on the pump-plate, and let \\( g n \\) be the pump-gage, and \\( m n \\) be made equal to \\( c e \\).\n\nThen, as has been already shown, \\( c b \\) is the measure of the elasticity of the air in \\( a b \\), corresponding to the bulk \\( a b \\). Now let some air be abstracted from the receiver. The elasticity of the remainder will be diminished by its expansion; and therefore the mercury in the tube \\( a e \\) will descend to some point \\( d \\). For the same reason, the mercury in the gage will rise to some point \\( o \\), and \\( m o \\) will express the elasticity of the air in the receiver. This would support the mercury in the tube \\( a e \\) at the height \\( r v \\), if the space \\( a r \\) were entirely void of air. Therefore \\( r d \\) is the effect and measure of the elasticity of the included air when it has expanded to the bulk \\( a d \\); and thus its elasticity, under a variety of other bulks, may be compared with its elasticity when of the bulk \\( a b \\). When the air has been so far abstracted from the receiver that the mercury in \\( a e \\) descends to \\( e \\), then \\( m o \\) will be the precise measure of its elasticity.\n\nIn all these cases it is necessary to compare its bulk \\( a b \\) with its natural bulk, in which its elasticity balances the pressure of the atmosphere. This may be done by laying the tube \\( a e \\) horizontally, and then the air will collapse into its ordinary bulk.\n\nAnother easy method may be taken for this examination. Let an apparatus \\( a b c d e f \\) (fig. 70.) be made, consisting of a horizontal tube \\( a e \\) of even bore, a ball \\( d g \\) of a large diameter, and a twin-neck tube \\( h f \\). Let the ball and part of the tube \\( g e b \\) be filled with mercury, so that the tube may be in the same horizontal plane with the surface \\( d e \\) of the mercury in the ball. Then seal up the end \\( a \\), and connect \\( f \\) with an air-pump. When the air is abstracted from the surface \\( d e \\), the air in \\( a b \\) will expand into a larger bulk \\( a c \\), and the mercury in the pump-gage will rise to some distance below the barometric height. It is evident that this distance, without any farther calculation, will be the measure of the elasticity of the air pressing on the surface \\( d e \\), and therefore of the air in \\( a e \\).\n\nThe most exact of all methods is to suspend in the receiver of an air-pump a glass vessel, having a very narrow mouth, over a cistern of mercury, and then abstract the air till the gage rises to some determined height. The difference \\( e \\) between this height and the barometric height determines the elasticity of the air in the receiver and in the suspended vessel. Now lower down that vessel by the slip-wire till its mouth is immersed into the mercury, and admit the air into the receiver; it will press the mercury into the little vessel. Lower it still farther down, till the mercury within it is level with that without; then stop its mouth, take it out and weigh the mercury, and let its weight be \\( w \\). Subtract this weight from the weight \\( v \\) of the mercury, which would completely fill the whole vessel; then the natural bulk of the air will be \\( v - w \\), while its bulk, when of the elasticity \\( e \\) in the rarefied receiver, was the bulk or capacity \\( w \\) of the vessel. Its density therefore, corresponding to this elasticity \\( e \\), was \\( \\frac{v - w}{w} \\).\n\nAnd thus may the relation between the density and elasticity in all cases be obtained.\n\nA great variety of experiments to this purpose have been made, with different degrees of attention, according to the interest which the philosophers had in the Boylean result. Those made by M. de Luc, General Roy, Mr. Trembley, and Sir George Shuckburgh, are by far the most accurate; but they are all confirmed to very moderate rarefactions. The general result has been, that periments the elasticity of rarefied air is very nearly proportional have been to its density. We cannot say with confidence that any made to regular deviation from this law has been observed, there being as many observations on one side as on the other; but we think that it is not unworthy the attention of philosophers to determine it with precision in the cases of extreme rarefaction, where the irregularities are most remarkable. The great source of error is a certain adhesive sluggishness of the mercury when the impelling forces are very small; and other fluids can hardly be used, because they either fill the inside of the tube and diminish its capacity, or they are converted into vapours, which alters the law of elasticity.\n\nLet us, upon the whole, assume the Boylean law, viz. The Boylean that the elasticity of the air is proportional to its density, an law may the truth in those cases which are of the greatest practical importance, that is, when the density does not much exceed or fall short of that of ordinary air.\n\nLet us now see what information this gives us with respect to the action of the particles on each other.\n\nThe investigation is extremely easy. We have seen that a force eight times greater than the pressure of the atmosphere will compress common air into the other eighth part of its common bulk, and give it eight times its common density; and in this case we know, that the particles are at half their former distance, and that the number which are now acting on the surface of the piston employed to compress them is quadruple of the number which act on it when it is of the common density. Therefore, when this eightfold compressing force is distributed over a fourfold number of particles, the portion of it which acts on each is double. In like manner, when a compressing force 27 is employed, the air is compressed into \\( \\frac{1}{47} \\) of its former bulk, the particles are at \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of their former distance, and the force is distributed among 9 times the number of particles; the force on each is therefore 3. In short, let \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) be the distance of the particles, the number of them in any given vessel, and therefore the density will be as \\( x^2 \\), and the number pressing by their elasticity on its whole internal surface will be as \\( x^3 \\). Experiment shows, that the compressing force is as \\( x^3 \\), which being distributed over the number as \\( x^2 \\), will give the force on each as \\( x \\).\n\nNow this force is in immediate equilibrium with the elasticity of the particle immediately contiguous to the compressing surface. This elasticity is therefore as \\( x \\); and it follows from the nature of perfect fluidity, that the particle adjoining to the compressing surface presses with an equal force on its adjoining particles on every side. Hence we must conclude, that the corporeal repulsions exerted by the adjoining particles are inversely as their distances from each other, or that the adjoining particles tend to recede from each other with forces inversely proportional to their distances.\n\nSir Isaac Newton was the first who reasoned in this manner from the phenomena. Indeed he was the first who had the patience to reflect on the phenomena with proper precision. His discoveries in gravitation naturally on this subject.","sp":322,"ep":323},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Boylean Law.\n\ngave his thoughts this turn, and he very early hinted his suspicions that all the characteristic phenomena of tangible matter were produced by forces which were exerted by the particles at small and inef\ufb01ble distances: And he considers the phenomena of air as affording an excellent example of this investigation, and deduces from them the law which we have now demonstrated; and says, that air consists of particles which avoid the adjoining particles with forces inversely proportional to their distances from each other. From this he deduces (in the 2d book of his Principles) several beautiful propositions, determining the mechanical constitution of the atmosphere.\n\nBut it must be noticed that he limits this action to the adjoining particles: and this is a remark of immense consequence, though not attended to by the numerous experimenters who adopt the law.\n\nIt is plain that the particles are supposed to act at a distance, and that this distance is variable, and that the forces diminish as the distances increase. A very ordinary air-pump will rarely the air 12 times. The distance of the particles is now 5 times greater than before; and yet they still repel each other: for air of this density will still support the mercury in a siphon-gage at the height of 0.24, or $\\frac{24}{100}$ of an inch; and a better pump will allow this air to expand twice as much, and still leave it elastic. Thus we see that whatever is the distance of the particles of common air, they can act five times farther off. The question comes now to be, Whether, in the state of common air, they really do act five times farther than the distance of the adjoining particles? While the particle $a$ acts on the particle $b$ with the force $s$, does it also act on the particle $c$ with the force $2.5$, on the particle $d$ with the force $1.667$, on the particle $e$ with the force $1.25$, on the particle $f$ with the force $1$, on the particle $g$ with the force $0.8333$, &c.?\n\nSir Isaac Newton shows in the plainest manner, that this is by no means the case; for if this were the case, he makes it appear that the sensible phenomena of condensation would be totally different from what we observe. The force necessary for a quadruple condensation would be eight times greater, and for a nonuple condensation the force must be 27 times greater. Two spheres filled with condensed air must repel each other, and two spheres containing air that is rarer than the surrounding air must attract each other, &c., &c. All this will appear very clearly, by applying to air the reasoning which Sir Isaac Newton has employed in deducing the sensible law of mutual tendency of two spheres, which consist of particles attracting each other with forces proportional to the square of the distance inversely.\n\nIf we could suppose that the particles of air repelled each other with invariable forces at all distances within some small and inef\ufb01ble limit, this would produce a compressibility and elasticity similar to what we observe. For if we consider a row of particles, within this limit, as compressed by an external force applied to the two extremities, the action of the whole row on the extreme points would be proportional to the number of particles, that is, to their distance inversely and to their density: and a number of such parcels, ranged in a straight line, would constitute a row of any sensible magnitude having the same law of compression. But this law of corpuscular Height of force is unlike every thing we observe in nature, and to the Atmosphere, the last degree improbable.\n\nWe must therefore continue the limitation of this mutual repulsion of the particles of air, and be contented for the present with having established it as an experimental fact, that the adjoining particles of air are kept asunder by forces inversely proportional to their distances: or perhaps it is better to abide by the sensible law, that the density of air is proportional to the compressing force. This law is abundantly suf\ufb01cient for explaining all the subordinate phenomena, and for giving us a complete knowledge of the mechanical constitution of our atmosphere.\n\nAnd in the \ufb01rst place, this view of the compressibility of the air must give us a very different notion of investigating the height of the atmosphere from what we deduced on a former occasion from our experiments. It is found, considering that when the air is of the temperature 32\u00b0 of Fahrenheit\u2019s thermometer, and the mercury in the barometer stands at 30 inches, it will descend one-tenth of an inch if we take it to a place 87 feet higher. Therefore, if the air were equally dense and heavy throughout, the height of the atmosphere would be $30 \\times 10 \\times 87$ feet, or 5 miles and 100 yards. But the loose reasoning adduced on that occasion was enough to show us that it must be much higher; because every stratum as we ascend must be successively rarer as it is less compressed by incumbent weight. Not knowing to what degree air expanded when the compression was diminished, we could not tell the successive diminutions of density and consequent augmentation of bulk and height; we could only say, that several atmospheric appearances indicated a much greater height. Clouds have been seen much higher; but the phenomenon of the twilight is the most convincing proof of this. There is no doubt that the visibility of the sky or air is owing to its want of perfect transparency, each particle (whether of matter purely aerial or heterogeneous) reflecting a little light.\n\nLet $b$ (fig. 71.) be the last particle of illuminated air which can be seen in the horizon by a spectator at $A$. This must be illuminated by a ray $SD$, touching the earth\u2019s surface at some point $D$. Now it is a known fact, that the degree of illumination called twilight is perceived when the sun is 18\u00b0 below the horizon of the spectator, that is, when the angle $EBS$ or $ACD$ is 18 degrees; therefore $bC$ is the secant of 9 degrees (it is less, viz. about 8\u00bd degrees, on account of refraction). We know the earth\u2019s radius to be about 3970 miles: hence we conclude $bB$ to be about 45 miles; nay, a very sensible illumination is perceptible much farther from the sun\u2019s place than this, perhaps twice as far, and the air is suf\ufb01ciently dense for re\ufb02ecting a sensible light at the height of nearly 200 miles.\n\nWe have now seen that air is prodigiously expansible. Experiment None of our experiments have distinctly shown us any face no limit. But it does not follow that it is expansible without end; nor is this at all likely. It is much more probable that there is a certain distance of the parts in which they no longer repel each other; and this would be the distance at which they would arrange themselves if they were not heavy. But at the very summit of the atmosphere they will be a very small matter nearer to each other, on account of their gravitation to the earth.\nTill we know precisely the law of this mutual repulsion, we cannot say what is the height of the atmosphere.\n\nBut if the air be an elastic fluid whose density is always proportionable to the compressing force, we can tell what is its density at any height above the surface of the earth; and we can compare the density so calculated with the density discovered by observation: for this last is measured by the height at which it supports mercury in the barometer. This is the direct measure of the pressure of the external air; and as we know the law of gravitation, we can tell what would be the pressure of air having the calculated density in all its parts.\n\nLet us therefore suppose a prismatic or cylindrical column of air reaching to the top of the atmosphere. Let this be divided into an indefinite number of strata of very small and equal depths or thicknesses; and let us, for greater simplicity, suppose at first that a particle of air is of the same weight at all distances from the centre of the earth.\n\nThe absolute weight of any one of these strata will on these conditions be proportional to the number of particles or the gravity of air contained in it; and since the depth of each stratum is the same, this quantity of air will evidently be as the density of the stratum: but the density of any stratum is as the compressing force; that is, as the pressure of the strata above it; that is, as their weight; that is, as their quantity of matter\u2014therefore the quantity of air in each stratum is proportional to the quantity of air above it; but the quantity in each stratum is the difference between the column incumbent on its bottom and on its top: these differences are therefore proportional to the quantities of which they are the differences. But when there is a series of quantities which are proportional to their own differences, both the quantities and their differences are in continual or geometrical progression: for let \\(a, b, c\\) be three such quantities that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{a-b}{b-c}, \\quad \\text{then by alter.}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{b-c}{c-b}, \\quad \\text{and by compof.}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{c}{b}, \\quad \\text{and } a = \\frac{b}{c}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore the densities of these strata decrease in a geometrical progression; that is, when the elevations above the centre or surface of the earth increase, or their depths under the top of the atmosphere decrease, in an arithmetical progression, the densities decrease in a geometrical progression.\n\nLet \\(ARQ\\) (fig. 72.) represent the section of the earth by a plane through its centre \\(O\\), and let \\(mOAM\\) be a vertical line, and \\(AE\\) perpendicular to \\(OA\\) will be a horizontal line through \\(A\\), a point on the earth's surface. Let \\(AE\\) be taken to represent the density of the air at \\(A\\); and let \\(DH\\), parallel to \\(AE\\), be taken to \\(AE\\) as the density at \\(D\\) is to the density at \\(A\\): it is evident, that if a logistic or logarithmic curve \\(EHN\\) be drawn, having \\(AN\\) for its axis, and passing through the points \\(E\\) and \\(H\\), the density of the air at any other point \\(C\\), in this vertical line, will be represented by \\(CG\\), the ordinate to the curve in that point: for it is the property of this curve, that if portions \\(AB, AC, AD\\), of its axis be taken in arithmetical progression, the ordinates \\(AE, BF, CG, DH\\), will be in geometrical progression.\n\nIt is another fundamental property of this curve, that if \\(EK\\) or \\(HS\\) touch the curve in \\(E\\) or \\(H\\), the subtangent \\(AK\\) or \\(DS\\) is a constant quantity.\n\nAnd a third fundamental property is, that the infinitely extended area \\(MAEN\\) is equal to the rectangle \\(KA \\times EL\\) of the ordinate and subtangent; and, in like manner, the area \\(MDHN\\) is equal to \\(SD \\times DH\\), or to \\(KA \\times DH\\); consequently the area lying beyond any ordinate is proportional to that ordinate.\n\nThese geometrical properties of this curve are all analogous to the chief circumstances in the constitution of the atmosphere, on the supposition of equal gravity. The area \\(MCGN\\) represents the whole quantity of aerial matter which is above \\(C\\); for \\(CG\\) is the density at \\(C\\), and \\(CD\\) is the thickness of the stratum between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\); and therefore \\(CGHD\\) will be as the quantity of matter or air in it; and in like manner of all the others, and of their sums, or the whole area \\(MCGN\\); and as each ordinate is proportional to the area above it, so each density, and the quantity of air in each stratum, is proportional to the quantity of air above it; and as the whole area \\(MAEN\\) is equal to the rectangle \\(KAEL\\), so the whole air of variable density above \\(A\\) might be contained in a column \\(KA\\), if, instead of being compressed by its own weight, it were without weight, and compressed by an external force equal to the pressure of the air at the surface of the earth. In this case, it would be of the uniform density \\(AE\\), which it has at the surface of the earth, making what we have repeatedly called the homogeneous atmosphere.\n\nHence we derive this important circumstance, that the height of the homogeneous atmosphere is the subtangent of that curve whose ordinates are as the densities of the air at different heights, on the supposition of equal gravity. This curve may with propriety be called the atmospheric logarithmic: and as the different logarithms are all characterized by their subtangents, it is of importance to determine this one.\n\nIt may be done by comparing the densities of mercury and air. For a column of air of uniform density, reaching to the top of the homogeneous atmosphere, is in equilibrium with the mercury in the barometer. Now it is found, by the best experiments, that when mercury and air are of the temperature \\(32^\\circ\\) of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and the barometer stands at 30 inches, the mercury is nearly 10440 times denser than air. Therefore the height of the homogeneous atmosphere is 10440 times 30 inches, or 2610 feet, or 8700 yards, or 4350 fathoms, or 5 miles wanting 100 yards.\n\nOr it may be found by observations on the barometer. It is found, that when the mercury and air are of the above temperature, and the barometer on the sea-shore stands at 30 inches, if we carry it to a place 884 feet higher it will fall to 29 inches. Now, in all logarithmic curves having equal ordinates, the portions of the axes intercepted between the corresponding pairs of ordinates are proportional to the subtangents. And the subtangents of the curve belonging to our common tables is \\(0.4342945\\), and the difference of the logarithms of 30 and 29 (which is the portion of the axis intercepted between the ordinates 30 and 29), or \\(0.0147233\\), is to \\(0.4342945\\) as 883 is to 2658 feet, or 8686 yards, or 4343 fathoms, or 5 miles wanting 114 yards. This determination is 14 yards less than the other, and it is uncertain which is the more exact. It is extremely difficult to\nto measure the respective densities of mercury and air; and in measuring the elevation which produces a fall of one inch in the barometer, an error of \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) of an inch would produce all the difference. We prefer the last, as depending on fewer circumstances.\n\nBut all this investigation proceeds on the supposition of equal gravity, whereas we know that the weight of a particle of air decreases as the square of its distance from the centre of the earth increases. In order, therefore, that a superior stratum may produce an equal pressure at the surface of the earth, it must be denser, because a particle of it gravitates less. The density, therefore, at equal elevations, must be greater than on the supposition of equal gravity, and the law of diminution of density must be different.\n\nMake \\( OD : OA = OA : Od \\); \\( OC : OA = OA : Oc \\); \\( OB : OA = OA : Ob \\); &c.; so that \\( Od, Oc, Ob, OA \\), may be reciprocals to \\( OD, OC, OB, OA \\); and through the points \\( A, b, c, d \\), draw the perpendiculars \\( AE, bf, cg, dh \\), making them proportional to the densities in \\( A, B, C, D \\); and let us suppose \\( CD \\) to be exceedingly small, so that the density may be supposed uniform through the whole stratum. Thus we have\n\n\\[\nOD \\times Od = OA^2 = OC \\times Oc \\\\\n\\text{and } Oc : Od = OD : OC \\\\\n\\text{and } Oc : Oc = OD : DC \\\\\n\\text{or } Oc : cd = OD : OD \\\\\n\\text{or, because } OC \\text{ and } OD \\text{ are ultimately in the ratio of equality, we have}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ncd : CD = Oc : OC = OA^2 : OC^2 \\\\\n\\text{and } cd \\times CD = OA^2 \\times OC^2 \\\\\n\\text{but } CD \\times cg \\times OC^2 \\text{ is as the pressure at } C \\text{ arising from the absolute weight of the stratum } CD. \\text{ For this weight is as the bulk, as the density, and as the gravitation of each particle jointly. Now } CD \\text{ expresses the bulk, } cg \\text{ the density, and } \\frac{OA^2}{OC^2} \\text{ the gravitation of each particle. Therefore, } cd \\times cg \\text{ is as the pressure on } C \\text{ arising from the weight of the stratum } DC; \\text{ but } cd \\times cg \\text{ is evidently the element of the curvilinear area } AmnE, \\text{ formed by the curve } Efghn \\text{ and the ordinates } AE, bf, cg, ah, &c., mn. \\text{ Therefore the sum of all the elements, such as } cd \\times cg, \\text{ that is, the area } cmng \\text{ below } cg, \\text{ will be as the whole pressure on } C, \\text{ arising from the gravitation of all the air above it; but, by the nature of air, this whole pressure is as the density which it produces, that is, as } cg. \\text{ Therefore the curve } Egn \\text{ is of such a nature that the area lying below or beyond any ordinate } cg \\text{ is proportional to that ordinate. This is the property of the logarithmic curve, and } Egn \\text{ is a logarithmic curve.}\n\nBut farther, this curve is the same with } EGN. \\text{ For let } B \\text{ continually approach to } A, \\text{ and ultimately coincide with it. It is evident that the ultimate ratio of } BA \\text{ to } Ab, \\text{ and of } BF \\text{ to } bf, \\text{ is that of equality; and if } EFK, EfK, \\text{ be drawn, they will contain equal angles with the ordinate } AE, \\text{ and will cut off equal subtangents } AK, Ak. \\text{ The curves } EGN, Fgn \\text{ are therefore the same, but in opposite positions.}\n\nLastly, if } OA, Oc, Or, Od, \\text{ &c. be taken in arithmetical progression decreasing, their reciprocals } OA, OB, OC, OD, \\text{ &c. will be in harmonical progression increasing, as is well known: but, from the nature of the logarithmic curve, when } OA, Ob, Oc, Od, \\text{ &c. are in arithmetical progression, the ordinates } AE, bf, cg, dh, \\text{ &c. are in geometrical progression. Therefore when } OA, OB, OC, OD, \\text{ &c. are in harmonical progression, the densities of the air at } A, B, C, D, \\text{ &c. are in geometrical progression; and thus may the density of the air at all elevations be discovered. Thus to find the density of the air at } K \\text{ the top of the homogeneous atmosphere, make } OK : OA = OA : OL, \\text{ and draw the ordinate } LT, \\text{ LT is the density at } K.\n\nThe celebrated Dr Halley was the first who observed the relation between the density of the air and the ordinates of the logarithmic curve, or common logarithms. This he did on the supposition of equal gravity; and his discovery is acknowledged by Sir Isaac Newton in Princip. ii. prop. 22. schol. Halley's dissertation on the subject is in No 185 of the Phil. Transf. Newton, with his usual sagacity, extended the same relation to the true state of the case, where gravity is as the square of the distance inversely; and showed that when the distances from the earth's centre are in harmonic progression, the densities are in geometric progression. He shows indeed, in general, what progression of the distance, on any supposition of gravity, will produce a geometrical progression of the densities, so as to obtain a set of lines } OA, Ob, Oc, Od, \\text{ &c. which will be logarithms of the densities. The subject was afterwards treated in a more familiar manner by Cotes in his Hydroft. Lect. and in his Harmonia Mundiurum; also by Dr Brook Taylor, Meth. Increment.; Wolf in his Aerometria; Herman in his Florononia; &c. &c., and lately by Horley, Phil. Transf. tom. lxiv.\n\nAn important corollary is deducible from these principles, viz. that the air has a finite density at an infinite distance from the centre of the earth, namely, density at such as will be represented by the ordinate } OP \\text{ drawn an infinite distance through the centre. It may be objected to this conclusion, that it would infer an infinity of matter in the centre of universe, and that it is inconsistent with the phenomena of the planetary motions, which appear to be performed in a space void of all resistance, and therefore of all matter. But this fluid must be so rare at great distances, that the resistance will be insensible, even though the retardation occasioned by it has been accumulated for ages. Even at the very moderate distance of 500 miles, the rarity is so great that a cubic inch of common air expanded to that degree would occupy a sphere equal to the orbit of Saturn; and the whole retardation which this planet would sustain after some millions of years would not exceed what would be occasioned by its meeting one bit of matter of half a grain weight.\n\nThis being the case, it is not unreasonable to suppose the visible universe occupied by air, which, by its gravitation, will accumulate itself round every body in it; in a proportion depending on their quantities of matter, the larger bodies attracting more of it than the smaller ones, and thus forming an atmosphere about each. And many appearances warrant this supposition. Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, and Venus, are evidently surrounded by atmospheres. The constitution of these atmospheres may differ exceedingly from other causes. If the pla-\nnet has nothing on its surface which can be dissolved by the air or volatilized by heat, the atmosphere will be continually clear and transparent, like that of the moon.\n\nMars has an atmosphere which appears precisely like our own, carrying clouds, or depositing snows; for when, by the obliquity of his axis to the plane of his ecliptic, he turns his north pole towards the sun, it is observed to be occupied by a broad white spot. As the summer of that region advances, this spot gradually wastes, and sometimes vanishes, and then the south pole comes in sight, surrounded in like manner with a white spot, which undergoes similar changes. This is precisely the appearance which the snowy circumpolar regions of this earth will exhibit to an astronomer on Mars. It may not, however, be known that we see; thick clouds will have the same appearances.\n\nThe atmosphere of the planet Jupiter is also very similar to our own. It is diversified by streaks or belts parallel to his equator, which frequently change their appearance and dimensions, in the same manner as those tracks of similar sky which belong to different regions of this globe. There is a certain kind of weather that more properly belongs to a particular climate than to any other. This is nothing but a certain general state of the atmosphere which is prevalent there, though with considerable variations. This must appear to a spectator in the moon like a streak spread over that climate, distinguishing it from others. But the most remarkable similarity is in the motion of the clouds on Jupiter. They have plainly a motion from east to west relative to the body of the planet; for there is a remarkable spot on the surface of the planet, which is observed to turn round the axis in gh. 51\u00b0 16\u2032; and there frequently appear variable and perilishing spots in the belts, which sometimes last for several revolutions. These are observed to circulate in g. 55\u00b0 05\u2032. These numbers are the results of a long series of observations by Dr Herschel. This plainly indicates a general current of the clouds westward, precisely similar to what a spectator in the moon must observe in our atmosphere arising from the trade-winds. Mr Schroeter has made the atmosphere of Jupiter a study for many years; and deduces from his observations that the motion of the variable spots is subject to great variations, but is always from east to west. This indicates variable winds.\n\nThe atmosphere of Venus appears also to be like ours, loaded with vapours, and in a state of continual change of absorption and precipitation. About the middle of the 17th century the surface of Venus was pretty distinctly seen for many years chequered with irregular spots, which are described by Campani, Bianchini, and other astronomers in the south of Europe, and also by Cassini at Paris, and Hooke and Townley in England. But the spots became gradually more faint and indistinct; and, for near a century, have disappeared. The whole surface appears now of one uniform brilliant white. The atmosphere is probably filled with a reflecting vapour, thinly diffused through it, like water faintly tinged with milk. A great depth of this must appear as white as a small depth of milk itself; and it appears to be of a very great depth, and to be refractive like our air. For Dr Herschel has observed, by the help of his fine telescopes, that the illuminated part of Venus is considerably more than a hemisphere, and that the light dies gradually away to the bounding margin. This is the very appearance that the earth would make if furnished with such an atmosphere. The boundary of illumination would have a penumbra reaching about nine degrees beyond it. If this be the constitution of the atmosphere of Venus, the may be inhabited by beings like ourselves. They would not be dazzled by the intolerable splendor of a sun four times as big and as bright, and fifteen times more glaring, than ours: for they would seldom or never see him, but instead of him an uniformly bright and white sky. They would probably never see a star or planet, unless the dog-star and Mercury; and perhaps the earth might pierce through the bright haze which surrounds their planet. For the same reason the inhabitants would not perhaps be incommode by the sun's heat. It is indeed a very questionable thing, whether the sun would cause any heat, even here, if it were not for the chemical action of his rays on our air. This is rendered not improbable by the intense cold felt on the tops of the highest mountains, in the clearest air, and even under a vertical sun in the torrid zone.\n\nThe atmosphere of comets seems of a nature totally different. This seems to be of inconceivable rarity, even when it reflects a very sensible light. The tail is always turned nearly away from the sun. It is thought that this is by the impulse of the solar rays. If this be the case, we think it might be discovered by the aberration and the refraction of the light by which we see the tail: for this light must come to our eye with a much smaller velocity than the sun's light, if it be reflected by repulsive or elastic forces, which there is every reason in the world to believe; and therefore the velocity of the reflected light will be diminished by all the velocity communicated to the reflecting particles. This is almost inconceivably great. The comet of 1683 went half round the sun in ten hours, and had a tail at least a hundred millions of miles long, which turned round at the same time, keeping nearly in the direction opposite to the sun. The velocity necessary for this is prodigious, approaching to that of light. And perhaps the tail extends much farther than we see it, but is visible only as far as the velocity with which its particles recede from the sun is less than a certain quantity, namely, what would leave a sufficient velocity for the reflected light to enable it to affect our eyes. And it may be demonstrated, that although the real form of the visible tail is concave on the anterior side to which the comet is moving, it may appear convex on that side, in consequence of the very great aberration of the light by which the remote parts are seen. All this may be discovered by properly contrived observations; and the conjecture merits attention. But of this digression there is enough; and we return to our subject, the constitution of our air.\n\nWe have shown how to determine *a priori* the density of the air at different elevations above the surface of the earth. But the densities may be discovered in all heights, accessible elevations by experiments; namely, by observing the heights of the mercury in the barometer. This is a direct measure of the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere; and this is proportional to the density which it produces.\n\nTherefore, by means of the relation subsisting between the densities and the elevations, we can discover the elevations by observations made on the densities by means","sp":323,"ep":327},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Barometer; and thus we may measure elevations by means of the barometer; and, with very little trouble, take the level of any extensive track of country. Of this we have an illustrious example in the section which the Abb\u00e9 Chapp\u00e9 D'Auteroche has given of the whole country between Brest and Ekaterineburgh in Siberia. This is a subject which deserves a minute consideration: we shall therefore present it under a very simple and familiar form; and trace the method through its various steps of improvement by De Luc, Rey, Shuckburgh, &c.\n\nWe have already observed, oftener than once, that if the mercury in the barometer stands at 32 inches, and if the air and mercury be of the temperature 32\u00b0 Fahrenheit's thermometer, a column of air 87 feet thick has the same weight with a column of mercury \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) of an inch thick. Therefore, if we carry the barometer to a higher place, so that the mercury sinks to 29.9, we have ascended 87 feet. Now, suppose we carry it still higher, and that the mercury stands at 29.8; it is required to know what height we have now got to? We have evidently ascended through another stratum of equal weight with the former: but it must be of greater thickness, because the air in it is rarer, being less compressed. We may call the density of the first stratum 300, measuring the density by the number of tenths of an inch of mercury which its elasticity proportional to its density enables it to support. For the same reason, the density of the second stratum must be 299: but when the weights are equal, the bulks are inversely as the densities; and when the bases of the strata are equal, the bulks are as the thicknesses. Therefore, to obtain the thickness of this second stratum, say 299:300 = 87:87.29; and this fourth term is the thickness of the second stratum, and we have ascended in all 174.29 feet. In like manner we may rise till the barometer shows the density to be 298: then say, 298:300 = 87:87.584 for the thickness of the third stratum, and 261.875 or 261.7 for the whole ascent; and we may proceed in the same way for any number of mercurial heights, and make a table of the corresponding elements as follows: Where the first column is the height of the mercury in the barometer, the second column is the thickness of the stratum, or the elevation above the preceding station; and the third column is the whole elevation above the first station.\n\n| Bar. | Strat. | Elev. |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 30   | 00,000 | 00,000 |\n| 29.9 | 87,000 | 87,000 |\n| 29.8 | 87,291 | 174,291 |\n| 29.7 | 87,584 | 261,875 |\n| 29.6 | 87,879 | 349,754 |\n| 29.5 | 88,176 | 437,930 |\n| 29.4 | 88,475 | 526,425 |\n| 29.3 | 88,776 | 615,181 |\n| 29.2 | 89,079 | 704,260 |\n| 29.1 | 89,384 | 793,644 |\n| 29   | 89,691 | 883,335 |\n\nHaving done this, we can now measure any elevation within the limits of our table, in this manner.\n\nObserve the barometer at the lower and at the upper stations, and write down the corresponding elevations. Subtract the one from the other, and the remainder is the height required. Thus suppose that at the lower station the mercurial height was 29.8, and that at the upper station it was 29.1.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n29.1 & \\quad 793,644 \\\\\n29.8 & \\quad 174,291 \\\\\n\\hline\n& \\quad 619,353 = \\text{Elevation}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe may do the same thing with tolerable accuracy without the table, by taking the medium \\( m \\) of the mercurial heights, and their difference \\( d \\) in tenths of an inch; and then say, as \\( m \\) to 300, so is \\( 87d \\) to the height required \\( h \\); or \\( h = \\frac{300 \\times 87d}{m} = \\frac{26100d}{m} \\). Thus, in the foregoing example, \\( m \\) is 294.5, and \\( d \\) is 7; and therefore \\( h = \\frac{7 \\times 26100}{294.5} = 620.4 \\), differing only one foot from the former value.\n\nEither of these methods is sufficiently accurate for most purposes, and even in very great elevations will not produce any error of consequence: the whole error of the elevation 883 feet 4 inches, which is the extent of the above table, is only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch.\n\nBut we need not confine ourselves to methods of approximation, when we have an accurate and scientific method that is equally easy. We have seen that, upon the supposition of equal gravity, the densities of the air are as the ordinates of a logarithmic curve, having the line of elevations for its axis. We have also seen that, in the true theory of gravity, if the distances from the centre of the earth increase in a harmonic progression, the logarithm of the densities will decrease in an arithmetical progression; but if the greatest elevation above the surface be but a few miles, this harmonic progression will hardly differ from an arithmetical one. Thus, if \\( A, b, A, c, A, d \\) are 1, 2, and 3 miles, we shall find that the corresponding elevations \\( AB, AC, AD \\) are sensibly in arithmetical progression also; for the earth's radius \\( AC \\) is nearly 4000 miles. Hence it plainly follows, that \\( BC - AB \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4000 \\times 4001} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{16004000} \\) of a mile, or \\( \\frac{1}{250} \\) of an inch; a quantity quite insignificant. We may therefore affirm without hesitation, that in all accessible places, the elevations increase in an arithmetical progression, while the densities decrease in a geometrical progression. Therefore the ordinates are proportional to the numbers which are taken to measure the densities, and the portions of the axis are proportional to the logarithms of these numbers. It follows, therefore, that we may take such a scale for measuring the densities that the logarithms of the numbers of this scale shall be the very portions of the axis; that is, of the vertical line in feet, yards, fathoms, or what measure we please: and we may, on the other hand, choose such a scale for measuring our elevations, that the logarithms of our scale of densities shall be parts of this scale of elevations; and we may find either of these scales scientifically. For it is a known property of the logarithmic curves, that when the ordinates are the same, the intercepted portion of the abscissae are proportioned to their subtangents. Now we know the subtangent of the atmospheric logarithmic: it is the height of the homogeneous atmosphere in any measure we please, suppose fathoms: we find this height by comparing the gravities of air and mercury, when both\nBarometer both are of some determined density. Thus, in the temperature of 32\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, when the barometer stands at 30 inches, it is known (by many experiments) that mercury is 10423.068 times heavier than air; therefore the height of the balancing column of homogeneous air will be 10423.068 times 30 inches; that is, 4342.945 English fathoms. Again, it is known that the subtangent of our common logarithmic tables, where 1 is the logarithm of the number 10, is 0.4342945. Therefore the number 0.4342945 is to the difference D of the logarithms of any two barometric heights as 4342.945 fathoms are to the fathoms F contained in the portion of the axis of the atmospherical logarithmic, which is intercepted between the ordinates equal to these barometrical heights; or that 0.4342945 : D = 4342.945 : F, and 0.4342945 : 4342.945 = D : F; but 0.4342945 is the ten-thousandth part of 4342.945, and therefore D is the ten-thousandth part of F.\n\nAnd thus it happens, by mere chance, that the logarithms of the densities, measured by the inches of mercury which their elasticity supports in the barometer, are just the ten-thousandth part of the fathoms contained in the corresponding portions of the axis of the atmospherical logarithmic. Therefore, if we multiply our common logarithms by 10000, they will express the fathoms of the axis of the atmospherical logarithmic; nothing is more easily done. Our logarithms contain what is called the index or characteristic, which is an integer and a number of decimal places. Let us just remove the integer-place four figures to the right hand: thus the logarithm of 60 is 1.7781513, which is one integer and 7781513. Multiply this by 10,000, and we obtain 7781513, or 7781513.\n\nThe practical application of all this reasoning is obvious and easy: observe the heights of the mercury in the barometer at the upper and lower stations in inches and decimals; take the logarithms of these, and subtract the one from the other: the difference between them (accounting the four first decimal figures as integers) is the difference of elevation of fathoms.\n\nExample.\n\n| Merc. Height at the lower station | 29.8 | 1.4742163 |\n|---------------------------------|------|------------|\n| upper station                   | 29.1 | 1.4638930  |\n\nDiff. of Log. \u00d7 10000 = 0.0103233\n\nor 103 fathoms and 233 of a fathom, which is 619.392 feet, or 619 feet 4\u00be inches; differing from the approximated value formerly found about \u00bd an inch.\n\nSuch is the general nature of the barometric measurement of heights first suggested by Dr Halley; and it has been verified by numerous comparisons of the heights calculated in this way with the same heights measured geometrically. It was indeed in this way that the precise specific gravity of air and mercury was most accurately determined; namely, by observing, that when the temperature of air and mercury was 32\u00b0, the difference of the logarithms of the mercurial heights were precisely the fathoms of elevation. But it requires many corrections to adjust this method to the circumstances of taking the case; and it was not till very lately that it has been so far adjusted to them as to become useful. We are chiefly indebted to Mr de Luc for the improvements. The great elevations in Switzerland enabled him to make an immense number of observations, in almost every variety of circumstances. Sir George Shuckburgh also made a great number with most accurate instruments in much greater elevations, in the same country; and he made many chamber experiments for determining the laws of variation in the subordinate circumstances. General Roy also made many to the same purpose. And to these two gentlemen we are chiefly obliged for the corrections which are now generally adopted.\n\nIt is easy to perceive that the method, as already expressed, cannot apply to every case: it depends on the specific gravity of air and mercury, combined with specific gravity that this is affected only by a change of gravity of air and mercury. But since all bodies are expanded by heat, etc., and as there is no reason to suppose that they are equally expanded by it, it follows that a change of temperature will change the relative gravity of mercury and air; even although both suffer the same change of temperature; and since the air may be warmed or cooled when the mercury is not, or may change its temperature independent of it, we may expect still greater variations of specific gravity.\n\nThe general effect of an augmentation of the specific gravity of the mercury must be to increase the subtangent of the atmospherical logarithmic; in which case the logarithms of the densities, as measured by inches of mercury, will express measures that are greater than fathoms in the same proportion that the subtangent is increased; or, when the air is more expanded than the mercury, it will require a greater height of homogeneous atmosphere to balance 30 inches of mercury, and a given fall of mercury will then correspond to a thicker stratum of air.\n\nIn order, therefore, to perfect this method, we must learn by experiment how much mercury expands by an increase of temperature; we must also learn how much the air expands by the same, or any change of temperature; and how much its elasticity is affected by it. Both these circumstances must be considered in the case of air; for it might happen that the elasticity of the air is not so much affected by heat as its bulk is.\n\nIt will, therefore, be proper to state in this place the experiments which have been made for ascertaining these two expansions.\n\nThe most accurate, and the best adapted experiments for ascertaining the expansion of mercury, are those of Roy's experiments. General Roy, published in the 67th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. He exposed 30 inches of mercury, actually supported by the atmosphere in a barometer, in a nice apparatus, by which it could be made of one uniform temperature through its whole length; and he noted the expansion of it in decimals of an inch. These are contained in the following table; where the first column expresses the temperature by Fahrenheit's thermometer, the second column expresses the bulk of the mercury, and the third column the expansion of an inch of mercury for an increase of one degree in the adjoining temperatures.\nThis table gives rise to some reflections. The scale of the thermometer is constructed on the supposition that the successive degrees of heat are measured by equal increments of bulk in the mercury of the thermometer. How comes it, therefore, that this is not accompanied by equal increments of bulk in the mercury of the column, but that the corresponding expansions of this column do continually diminish? General Roy attributes this to the gradual detachment of elastic matter from the mercury by heat, which presses on the top of the column, and therefore shortens it. He applied a boiling heat to the vacuum atop, without producing any farther depression; a proof that the barometer had been carefully filled. It had indeed been boiled through its whole length. He had attempted to measure the mercurial expansion in the usual way, by filling 30 inches of the tube with boiled mercury, and exposing it to the heat with the open end uppermost. But here it is evident that the expansion of the tube, and its fluid contents, must be taken into the account. The expansion of the tube was found to exceedingly irregular, and so incapable of being determined with precision for the tubes which were to be employed, that he was obliged to have recourse to the method with the real barometer. In this no regard was necessary to any circumstance but the perpendicular height. There was, besides, a propriety in examining the mercury in the very condition in which it was used for measuring the pressure of the atmosphere; because whatever complication there was in the results, it was the same in the barometer in actual use.\n\nThe most obvious manner of applying these experiments on the expansion of mercury to our purpose, is to reduce the observed height of the mercury to what it would have been if it were of the temperature 32\u00b0. Thus, suppose that the observed mercurial height is 29.2, and that the temperature of the mercury is 72\u00b0, make \\( \\frac{30.1302}{30} = 29.2 : 29.0738 \\). This will be the true measure of the density of the air of the standard temperature. In order that we may obtain the exact temperature of the mercury, it is proper that the observation be made by means of a thermometer attached to the barometer-frame, so as to warm and cool along with it.\n\nOr, this may be done without the help of a table, and with sufficient accuracy, from the circumstance that the expansion of an inch of mercury for one degree diminishes very nearly \\( \\frac{1}{365} \\)th part in each succeeding degree. If therefore we take from the expansion at 32\u00b0 its thousandth part for each degree of any range above it, we obtain a mean rate of expansion for that range. If the observed temperature of the mercury is below 32\u00b0, we must add this correction to obtain the mean expansion. This rule will be made more exact if we suppose the expansion at 32\u00b0 to be \\( 0.0001127 \\). Then multiply the observed mercurial height by this expansion, and we obtain the correction, to be subtracted or added according as the temperature of the mercury was above or below 32\u00b0. Thus to abide by the former example of 72\u00b0. This exceeds 32\u00b0 by 40\u00b0; therefore take 40\u00b0 from 0.0001127, and we have 0.0001087 for the medium expansion for that range. Multiply this by 40\u00b0, and we have the whole expansion of one inch of mercury, \\( = 0.0004348 \\). Multiply the inches of mercurial height, viz. 29.2 by this expansion, and we have for the correction \\( 1.12606 \\); which being subtracted from the observed height leaves 29.07304, differing from the accurate quantity less than the thousandth part of an inch. This rule is very easily kept in the memory, and supercedes the use of a table.\n\nThis correction may be made with all necessary exactness by a rule still more simple; namely, by multiplying the observed height of the mercury by the difference of its temperature from 32\u00b0, and cutting off four cyphers before the decimals of the mercurial height. This will seldom err \\( \\frac{1}{365} \\)th of an inch. We even believe that it is the most exact method within the range of temperatures that can be expected to occur in measuring heights; for it appears, by comparing many experiments and observations, that General Roy's measure of the mercurial expansion is too great, and that the expansion of an inch of mercury between 20\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer does not exceed \\( 0.000102 \\) per degree. Having thus corrected the observed mercurial heights by reducing them to what they would have been if the mercury had been of the standard temperature, the logarithms of the corrected heights are taken, and their difference, multiplied by 10000, will give the difference of elevations in English fathoms.\n\nThere is another way of applying this correction, fully more expeditious and equally accurate. The difference of the logarithms of the mercurial heights is the measure of the ratio of those heights. In like manner the difference of the logarithms of the observed and corrected heights at any station is the measure of the ratio of those heights. Therefore this last difference of the logarithms is the measure of the correction of this ratio. Now the observed height is to the corrected height nearly as 1 to 1.000102. The logarithm of this ratio, or the difference of the logarithms of 1 and 1.000102, is 0.0000444. This is the correction for each degree that","sp":327,"ep":330},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Barometer that the temperature of the mercury differs from 32\u00b0. Therefore multiply 0.000444 by the difference of the mercurial temperatures from 32\u00b0, and the products will be the corrections of the respective logarithms.\n\nBut there is still an easier way of applying the logarithmic correction. If both the mercurial temperatures are the same, the differences of their logarithms will be the same, although each may be a good deal above or below the standard temperature, if the expansion be very nearly equable. The correction will be necessary only when the temperatures at the two stations are different, and will be proportional to this difference. Therefore, if the difference of the mercurial temperatures be multiplied by 0.000444, the product will be the correction to be made on the difference of the logarithms of the mercurial heights.\n\nBut farther, since the differences of the logarithms of the mercurial heights are also the differences of elevation in English fathoms, it follows that the correction is also a difference of elevation in English fathoms, or that the correction for one degree of difference of mercurial temperature is \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) of a fathom, or 32 inches, or 2 feet 8 inches.\n\nThis correction of 2.8 for every degree of difference of temperature must be subtracted from the elevation found by the general rate, when the mercury at the upper station is colder than that at the lower. For when this is the case, the mercurial column at the upper station will appear too short, the pressure of the atmosphere too small, and therefore the elevation in the atmosphere will appear greater than it really is.\n\nTherefore the rule for this correction will be to multiply 0.000444 by the degrees of difference between the mercurial temperatures at the two stations, and to add or subtract the product from the elevation found by the general rule, according as the mercury at the upper station is hotter or colder than at the lower.\n\nIf the experiments of General Roy on the expansion of the mercury in a real barometer be thought most deserving of attention, and the expansion be considered as variable, the logarithmic difference corresponding to this expansion for the mean temperature of the two barometers may be taken. These logarithmic differences are contained in the following table, which is carried as far as 112\u00b0, beyond which it is not probable that any observations will be made. The number for each temperature is the difference between the logarithms of 30 inches of the temperature 32\u00b0, and of 30 inches expanded by that temperature.\n\n| Temp. | Log. diff. | Dec. of Fath. | Ft.

The relative gravity of the two, on which consequently the unit of our scale of elevations, is much more affected by the heat of the air than by the heat of the mercury.\n\nThis adjustment is of incomparably greater difficulty than the former, and we can hardly hope to make it perfect. We shall narrate the chief experiments which have been made on the expansion of air, and deduce from them such rules as appear to be necessary consequences of them, and then notice the circumstances which leave the matter still imperfect.\n\nGeneral Roy compared a mercurial and an air thermometer, each of which was graduated arithmetically, so that the units of the scales were equal bulks of mercury and air, and equal bulks (perhaps different from the thermometer) of air. He found their progress as in the following table.\n\n| Merc. | Diff. | Air. | Diff. |\n|-------|------|-----|------|\n| 212   | 20   | 212.0 | 17.6 |\n| 192   | 20   | 194.4 | 18.2 |\n| 172   | 20   | 176.2 | 18.8 |\n| 152   | 20   | 157.4 | 19.4 |\n| 132   | 20   | 138.0 | 20.0 |\n| 112   | 20   | 118.0 | 20.8 |\n| 92    | 20   | 97.2  | 21.6 |\n| 72    | 20   | 75.6  | 22.6 |\n| 52    | 20   | 53.0  | 21.6 |\n| 32    | 20   | 31.4  | 20.0 |\n| 12    |      | 11.4  |      |\n\nIt has been established by many experiments that equal increments of heat produce equal increments in the bulk of mercury. The differences of temperature are therefore expressed by the second column, and may be considered as equal; and the numbers of the third column must be allowed to express the same temperatures with those of the first. They directly express the bulks of the air, and the numbers of the fourth column express the differences of these bulks. These are evidently unequal, and show that common air expands most of all when the temperature is 62 nearly.\n\nThe next point was to determine what was the actual increase of bulk by some known increase of heat. For this purpose he took a tube having a narrow bore, and a ball at one end. He measured with great care the bulk from capacity of both the ball and the tube, and divided the known tube into equal spaces which bore a determined proportion to the capacity of the ball. This apparatus was set in a long cylinder filled with frigorific mixtures or with water, which could be uniformly heated up to the boiling temperature, and was accompanied by a nice thermometer. The expansion of the air was measured by means of a column of mercury which rose or sunk in the tube. The tube being of a small bore, the mercury did not drop out of it; and the bore being chosen as equal as possible, this column remained of an uniform length, whatever part of the tube it chanced to occupy. By this contrivance he was able to examine the","sp":330,"ep":331},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Barometer, the expansibility of air of various densities. When the column of mercury contained only a single drop or two, the air was nearly of the density of the external air. If he wished to examine the expansion of air twice or thrice as dense, he used a column of 30 or 60 inches long; and to examine the expansion of air that is rarer than the external air, he placed the tube with the ball uppermost, the open end coming through a hole in the bottom of the vessel containing the mixtures or water. By this position the column of mercury was hanging in the tube, supported by the pressure of the atmosphere; and the elasticity of the included air was measured by the difference between the suspended column and the common barometer.\n\nThe following table contains the expansion of 1000 parts of air, nearly of the common density, by heating it from 0 to 212. The first column contains the height of the barometer; the second contains this height augmented by the small column of mercury in the tube of the manometer, and therefore expresses the density of the air examined; the third contains the total expansion of 1000 parts; and the fourth contains the expansion for 1\u00b0, supposing it uniform throughout.\n\n**Table D.**\n\n| Barom. | Density of Air examined. | Expansion of 1000 pts by 212\u00b0 | Expansion by 1\u00b0 |\n|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| 29.95  | 31.52                    | 483.89                        | 2.2825         |\n| 30.07  | 30.77                    | 482.10                        | 2.2741         |\n| 29.48  | 29.90                    | 480.74                        | 2.2676         |\n| 29.90  | 30.73                    | 485.86                        | 2.2918         |\n| 29.96  | 30.92                    | 489.45                        | 2.3087         |\n| 29.90  | 30.55                    | 476.04                        | 2.2453         |\n| 29.95  | 30.60                    | 487.55                        | 2.2998         |\n| 30.07  | 30.60                    | 482.80                        | 2.2774         |\n| 29.48  | 30.00                    | 489.47                        | 2.3087         |\n| Mean   | 30.62                    | 484.21                        | 2.2840         |\n\nHence it appears, that the mean expansion of 1000 parts of air of the density 30.62 by one degree of Fahrenheit's thermometer is 2.284, or that 1000 becomes 1002.284.\n\nIf this expansion be supposed to follow the same rate that was observed in the comparison of the mercurial and air thermometer, we shall find that the expansion of a thousand parts of air for one degree of heat at the different intermediate temperatures will be as in the following table.\n\n**Table E.**\n\n| Temp. | Total Expansion. | Expansion for 1\u00b0 | Temp. | Total Expansion. | Expansion for 1\u00b0 |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------|-------|------------------|-----------------|\n| 212   | 484.210          | 2.009            | 72    | 172.671           | 2.5581          |\n| 192   | 444.011          | 2.0080           | 62    | 147.090           | 2.6037          |\n| 172   | 402.452          | 2.1475           | 52    | 121.053           | 2.5124          |\n| 152   | 359.593          | 2.2155           | 42    | 95.920            | 2.4211          |\n| 132   | 315.193          | 2.2840           | 32    | 71.718            | 2.3297          |\n| 112   | 269.513          | 2.3754           | 22    | 48.421            | 2.2383          |\n| 92    | 222.006          | 2.4211           | 12    | 26.038            | 2.1698          |\n| 82    | 197.795          | 2.5124           |       |                   |                 |\n| 72    | 172.671          |                 |       |                   |                 |\n\nIf we would have a mean expansion for any particular range, as between 12\u00b0 and 92\u00b0, which is the most likely to comprehend all the geodetical observations, we need only take the difference of the bulks 26.038 and 222.006 = 195.968, and divide this by the interval of temperature 80\u00b0, and we obtain 2.4496, or 2.45 for the mean expansion for 1\u00b0.\n\nIt would perhaps be better to adapt the table to a mass of 1000 parts of air of the standard temperature 32\u00b0; for in its present form it shows the expansibility of air originally of the temperature 0\u00b0. This will be done with sufficient accuracy by saying (for 212\u00b0) \\( \\frac{1071.718}{1484.210} = 1000 : 13849 \\), and so of the rest.

He found in general, that their expansibility by heat was analogous to that of air in its ordinary density, being greatest about the temperature 65\u00b0. He found, too, that its expansibility by heat diminished with its density, but he could not determine the law of gradation. When reduced to about one-fifth of the density of common air, its expansion was as follows.\n\n| Temp. | Bulk.   | Difference | Expansion for 1\u00b0 |\n|-------|---------|------------|-----------------|\n| 212   | 1141.504| 7.075      | 0.354           |\n| 192   | 1134.429| 12.264     | 0.613           |\n| 172   | 1128.165| 14.150     | 0.708           |\n| 152   | 1108.015| 14.151     | 0.708           |\n| 132   | 1093.864| 14.228     | 0.711           |\n| 112   | 1079.636| 14.228     | 0.711           |\n| 92    | 1064.609| 14.937     | 0.747           |\n| 72    | 1043.788| 20.911     | 1.045           |\n| 52    | 1017.845| 25.943     | 1.297           |\n| 32    | 1000.000| 17.845     | 0.892           |\n\nMean expansion 0.786\n\nFrom this very extensive and judicious range of experiments, it is evident that the expansibility of air by heat is greatest when the air is about its ordinary density, and that in small densities it is greatly diminished. It appears also, that the law of compression is altered; for in this specimen of the rare air half of the whole expansion happens about the temperature 99\u00b0, but in air of ordinary density at 105\u00b0. This being the case, we see that the experiments of Mr Amontons, narrated in the Memoirs of the Academy at Paris 1702, &c. are not inconsistent with those more perspicuous experiments of General Roy. Amontons found, that whatever was the density of the air, at least in cases much denser than ordinary air, the change of 18\u00b0 of temperature increased its elasticity in the same proportion; for he found, that the column of mercury which it supported when of the temperature 50\u00b0, was increased one-third at the temperature 212\u00b0. Hence he hastily concluded, that its expansibility was increased in the same proportion; but this by no means follows, unless we are certain that in every temperature the elasticity is proportional to the density. This is a point which still remains undecided; and it merits attention, because if true it establishes a remarkable law concerning the action of heat, which would seem to go to prove that the elasticity of fluids is the property of the matter of fire, which it superinduces on every body with which it combines in the form of vapour.\n\nAfter this account of the expansion of air, we see that the height through which we must rise in order to produce a given fall of the mercury in the barometer, or the thickness of the stratum of air equiponderant with a tenth of an inch of mercury, must increase with the expansion of air; and that if \\( \\frac{2.29}{1000} \\) be the expansion for one degree, we must multiply the excess of the temperature of the air above 32\u00b0 by 0.00229, and multiply the product by 87, in order to obtain the thickness of the stratum where the barometer stands at 30 inches: or whatever be the elevation indicated by the difference of the barometrical heights, upon the supposition that the air is of the temperature 32\u00b0, we must multiply this by 0.00229 for every degree that the air is warmer or colder than 32\u00b0. The product must be added to the elevation in the first case, and subtracted in the latter.\n\nSir George Shuckburgh deduces 0.0024 from his experiments as the mean expansion of air in the ordinary cases; and this is probably nearer the truth; because General Roy's experiments were made on air which was freer from damp than the ordinary air in the fields: and it appears from his experiments, that a very minute quantity of damp increases its expansibility by heat in a prodigious degree.\n\nThe great difficulty is how to apply this correction; or rather, how to determine the temperature of the air in this thole extensive and deep strata in which the elevations mode of are measured. It seldom or never happens that the stratum is of the same temperature throughout. It is commonly much colder aloft; it is also of different constitutions. Below it is warm, loaded with vapour, and very expansible; above it is cold, much drier, and less expansible, both by its dryness and its rarity. The currents of wind are often disposed in strata, which long retain their places; and as they come from different regions, are of different temperatures and different constitutions. We cannot therefore determine the expansion of the whole stratum with precision, and must content ourselves with an approximation: and the best approximation that we can make is, by supposing the whole stratum of a mean temperature between those of its upper and lower extremity, and employ the expansion corresponding to that mean temperature.\n\nThis, however, is founded on a gratuitous supposition, that the whole intermediate stratum expands alike, and that the expansion is equable in the different intermediate temperatures; but neither of these is warranted by experiment. Rare air expands less than what is denser; and therefore the general expansion of the whole stratum renders its density more uniform. Dr Horsley has pointed out some curious consequences of this in Phil. Trans. vol. lxiv. There is a particular elevation at which the general expansion, instead of diminishing the density of the air, increases it by the superior expansion of what is below; and we know that the expansion is not equable in the intermediate temperatures; but we cannot find out a rule which will give us a more accurate correction than by taking the expansion for the mean temperature.\n\nWhen we have done this, we have carried the method of measuring heights by the barometer as far as it can go; and this source of remaining error makes it needless to attend to some other very minute equations which theory points out. Such is the diminution of the weight of the mercury by the change of distance from the centre of the earth. This accompanies the diminution of the weight of the air, but neither so as to compensate it, nor to go along with it pari passu.\n\nAfter all, there are found cases where there is a regular deviation from those rules, of which we cannot give any very satisfactory account. Thus it is found, that in the province of Quito in Peru, which is at a great elevation above the surface of the ocean, the heights obtained by these rules fall considerably short of the","sp":332,"ep":333},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Barometer, the real heights; and at Spitzbergen they considerably exceed them. It appears that the air in the circumpolar regions is denser than the air of the temperate climates when of the same heat and under the same pressure; and the contrary seems to be the case with the air in the torrid zone. It would seem that the specific gravity of air to mercury is at Spitzbergen about 1 to 1224, and in Peru about 1 to 13100. This difference is with great probability ascribed to the greater dryness of the circumpolar air.\n\nThis source of error will always remain; and it is combined with another, which should be attended to by all who practice this method of measuring heights, namely, a difference in the specific gravity of the quicksilver. It is thought sufficiently pure for a barometer when it is cleared of all calcinable matter, so as not to drag or foully the tube. In this state it may contain a considerable portion of other metals, particularly of silver, bismuth, and tin, which will diminish its specific gravity. It has been obtained by revivification from cinnabar of the specific gravity 14.229, and it is thought very fine if 13.65. Sir George Shuckburgh found the quicksilver which agreed precisely with the atmospheric observations on which the rules are founded, to have the specific gravity 13.61. It is seldom obtained so heavy. It is evident that these variations will change the whole results; and that it is absolutely necessary, in order to obtain precision, that we know the density of the mercury employed. The subtangent of the atmospheric logarithmic, or the height of the homogeneous atmosphere, will increase in the same proportion with the density of the mercury; and the elevation corresponding to one-tenth of an inch of barometric height will change in the same proportion.\n\nWe must be contented with the remaining imperfections: and we can readily see, that, for any purpose that can be answered by such measurements of great heights, the method is sufficiently exact; but it is quite inadequate to the purpose of taking accurate levels, for directing the construction of canals, aqueducts, and other works of this kind, where extreme precision is absolutely necessary.\n\nWe shall now deduce from all that has been said on this subject sets of easy rules for the practice of this mode of measurement, illustrating them by an example.\n\n1. M. DE LUC's Method.\n\nI. Subtract the logarithm of the barometrical height at the upper station from the logarithm of that at the lower, and count the index and four first decimal figures of the remainder as fathoms, the rest as a decimal fraction. Call this the elevation.\n\nII. Note the different temperatures of the mercury at the two stations, and the mean temperature. Multiply the logarithmic expansion corresponding to this mean temperature (in Table B, p. 799.) by the difference of the two temperatures, and subtract the product from the elevation if the barometer has been coldest at the upper station, otherwise add it. Call the difference or the sum the approximated elevation.\n\nIII. Note the difference of the temperatures of the air at the two stations by a detached thermometer, and also the mean temperature and its difference from 32\u00b0. Multiply this difference by the expansion of air for the mean temperature, and multiply the approximate elevation by \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{this product}} \\), according as the air is above or below 32\u00b0. The product is the correct elevation in fathoms and decimals.\n\nExample.\n\nSuppose that the mercury in the barometer at the lower station was at 29.4 inches, that its temperature was 50\u00b0, and the temperature of the air was 45\u00b0; and let the height of the mercury at the upper station be 25.19 inches, its temperature 46\u00b0, and the temperature of the air 39\u00b0. Thus we have\n\n| Alt Hts. | Temp. | \u00a7. Mean. | Temp. Air.

Reduce the barometric heights to what they would be if they were of the temperature 32\u00b0.\n\nII. The difference of the logarithms of the reduced barometrical heights will give the approximate elevation.\n\nIII. Correct the approximated elevation as before.\n\nSame Example.\n\nI. Mean expans. for 1\u00b0 from Tab. A, is 0.000111.\n\\( 18\u00b0 \\times 0.000111 \\times 29.4 = 0.059 \\)\nSubtract this from = 29.4\n\nReduced barometric height = 29.341\n\nExpans. from Tab.

If 0.000101 be supposed the mean expansion of mercury for 1\u00b0, as Sir George Shuckburgh determines it, the reduction of the barometric heights will be had sufficiently exact by multiplying the observed heights of the mercury by the difference of its temperatures.\nBarometer. peratures from 32, and cutting off four more decimal places; thus \\( \\frac{29.4}{1000} \\times 18 \\) gives the reduced height 29.347, and \\( \\frac{25.19}{10000} \\times 14 \\) gives 25.155, and the difference of their logarithms gives 669.4 fathoms for the approximated elevation, which differs from the one given above by no more than 15 inches.\n\nRemark 2. If 0.0024 be taken for the expansion of air for one degree, the correction for this expansion will be had by multiplying the approximated elevation by 12, and this product by the sum of the differences of the temperatures from 32\u00b0, counting the difference as negative when the temperature is below 32, and cutting off four places; thus \\( \\frac{669.196}{10000} \\times 12 \\times \\frac{13+07}{10000} = 16.061 \\), which added to 669.196 gives 685.257, differing from the former only 9 inches.\n\nFrom the same premises we may derive a rule, which is abundantly exact for all geodetical purposes, and which requires no tables of any kind, and is easily remembered.\n\n1. The height through which we must rise in order to produce any fall of the mercury in the barometer, is inversely proportional to the density of the air, that is, to the height of the mercury in the barometer.\n\n2. When the barometer stands at 30 inches, and the air and quicksilver are of the temperature 32, we must rise through 87 feet, in order to produce a depression of \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch.\n\n3. But if the air be of a different temperature, this 87 feet must be increased or diminished by 0.21 of a foot for every degree of difference of the temperature from 32\u00b0.\n\n4. Every degree of difference of the temperatures of the mercury at the two stations makes a change of 2.833 feet, or 2 feet 10 inches in the elevation.\n\nHence the following rule.\n\n1. Take the difference of the barometric heights in tenths of an inch. Call this \\( d \\).\n\n2. Multiply the difference \\( a \\) between 32, and the mean temperature of the air by 21, and take the sum or difference of this product and 87 feet. This is the height through which we must rise to cause the barometer to fall from 30 inches to 29.9. Call this height \\( h \\).\n\nLet \\( m \\) be the mean between the two barometric heights. Then \\( \\frac{30 \\times h \\times d}{m} \\) is the approximated elevation very nearly.\n\nMultiply the difference \\( b \\) of the mercurial temperatures by 2.83 feet, and add this product to the approximated elevation if the upper barometer has been the warmest, otherwise subtract it. The result, that is, the sum or difference, will be the corrected elevation.\n\nSame Example.\n\n\\[\nd = 29.4 - 25.19 = 4.21 \\\\\nb = 87 + 10 \\times 0.21 = 89.1 \\\\\nm = \\frac{29.4 + 25.19}{2} = 27.29 \\\\\n\\]\n\nApprox. elevation \\( = \\frac{30 \\times 4.21 \\times 89.1}{27.29} = 4123.24 \\) feet.\n\nCorr. for temp. of mercury, \\( = 4 \\times 2.83 = 11.32 \\)\n\nCorrected elevation in feet \\( = 4111.92 \\)\n\nDitto in fathoms \\( = 685.32 \\)\n\nDiffering from the former only 15 inches.\n\nThis rule may be expressed by the following simple and easily remembered formula, where \\( a \\) is the difference between 32\u00b0 and the mean temperature of the air, \\( d \\) is the difference of barometric heights in tenths of an inch, \\( m \\) is the mean barometric height, \\( b \\) the difference between the mercurial temperatures, and \\( E \\) is the correct elevation.\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{30(87 + 0.21a)d}{m} = 2.83\n\\]\n\nWe shall now conclude this subject by an account of Heights of some of the most remarkable mountains, &c., on the most earth, above the surface of the ocean, in feet.\n\nMount Puy de Domme in Auvergne, the first mountain measured by the barometer\n\n| Mountain                  | Height |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Mount Blanc               | 5088   |\n| Monte Rosa                | 15662  |\n| Aiguille d'Argenture       | 15084  |\n| Alps                      |        |\n| Monastery of St Bernard    | 13402  |\n| Mount Cenis               | 7944   |\n| Pic de los Reyes           | 9212   |\n| Pic du Midi               | 7620   |\n| Pyrenees                  | 9300   |\n| Pic d'Offano              | 11700  |\n| Canegou                   | 8544   |\n| Lake of Geneva            | 1232   |\n| Mount Aetna               | 12954  |\n| Mount Vesuvius            | 3938   |\n| Mount Hekla in Iceland    | 4887   |\n| Snowdown                  | 3555   |\n| Ben More                  | 3723   |\n| Ben Lawers                | 3858   |\n| Ben Gloe                  | 3472   |\n| Schehallion               | 3461   |\n| Ben Lomond                | 3180   |\n| Tinto                     | 2342   |\n| Table Hill, Cape of Good Hope | 3454 |\n| Gondar city in Abyssinia  | 8490   |\n| Source of the Nile        | 8082   |\n| Pic of Tenerife           | 14026  |\n| Chimborazo                | 19595  |\n| Cayambourou               | 19391  |\n| Antifana                  | 19290  |\n| Pinchinha (see Peru, no 56.) | 15670 |\n| City of Quito (see ditto) | 9977   |\n| Calpian sea below the ocean | 306   |\n\nThis last is so singular, that it is necessary to give the authority on which this determination is founded. It is deduced from nine years observations with the barometer at Astrachan by Mr Lecre, compared with a series of observations made with the same barometer at St Peterburgh.\n\nThis employment of the barometer has caused it to become a very interesting instrument to the philosopher, and to the traveller; and many attempts have been made of late to improve it, and render it more portable. The improvements have either been directed to the enlargement of its range, or to the more accurate measurement of its present scale. Of the first kind are Hooke's wheel barometer, the diagonal barometer, and the horizontal barometer, described in a former part of this work.","sp":333,"ep":335},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Barometer work. See Barometer. In that place are also described two very ingenious contrivances of Mr Rowning, which are evidently not portable. Of all the barometers with an enlarged scale the best is that invented by Dr Hooke in 1668, and described in the Phil. Trans. No. 185. The invention was also claimed by Huyghens and by De la Hire; but Hooke's was published long before.\n\nIt consists of a compound tube ABCDEFG (fig. 73.), of which the parts AB and DE are equally wide, and EFG as much narrower as we would amplify the scale. The parts AB and EG must also be as perfectly cylindrical as possible. The part HBCDI is filled with mercury, having a vacuum above in AB. IF is filled with a light fluid, and FG with another light fluid which will not mix with that in IF. The cistern G is of the same diameter as AB. It is easy to see that the range of the separating surface at F must be as much greater than that of the surface I as the area of I is greater than that of F. And this ratio is in our choice. This barometer is free from all the bad qualities of those formerly described, being most delicately moveable; and is by far the fittest for a chamber, for amusement, by observations on the changes of the atmospheric pressure. The slightest breeze causes it to rise and fall, and it is continually in motion.\n\nBut this, and all other contrivances of the kind, are inferior to the common barometer for measurement of heights, on account of their bulk and cumbersome nature; nay, they are inferior for all philosophical purposes in point of accuracy; and this for a reason that admits of no reply. Their scale must be determined in all its parts by the common barometer; and, therefore, notwithstanding their great range, they are susceptible of no greater accuracy than that with which the scale of a common barometer can be observed and measured. This will be evident to any person who will take the trouble to consider how the points of their scale must be ascertained. The most accurate method for graduating such a barometer as we have now described would be to make a mixture of vitriolic acid and water, which should have \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of the density of mercury. Then, let a long tube stand vertical in this fluid, and connect its upper end with the open end of the barometer by a pipe which has a branch to which we can apply the mouth. Then if we suck through this pipe, the fluid will rise both in the barometer and in the other tube; and 10 inches rise in this tube will correspond to one inch descent in the common barometer. In this manner may every point of the scale be adjusted in due proportion to the rest. But it still remains to determine what particular point of the scale corresponds to some determined inch of the common barometer. This can only be done by an actual comparison; and this being done, the whole becomes equally accurate. Except therefore for the mere purpose of chamber amusement, in which case the barometer last described has a decided preference, the common barometer is to be preferred; and our attention should be entirely directed to its improvement and portability.\n\nFor this purpose it should be furnished with two microscopes or magnifying glasses, one of them stationed at the beginning of the scale; which should either be moveable, so that it may always be brought to the surface of the mercury in the cistern, or the cistern should be contrived that its surface may always be brought to the beginning of the scale. The glass will enable us to see the coincidence with accuracy. The other microscope must be moveable, so as to be set opposite to the surface of the mercury in the tube; and the scale should be furnished with a vernier which divides an inch into 1000 parts, and be made of materials of which we know the expansion with great precision.\n\nFor an account of many ingenious contrivances to make instruments accurate, portable, and commodious, consult Magellan, Dijfer. de diverses Instr. de Phys.; Phil.

Nov. ii. 200 viii.\n\nThus we have given an elementary account of the distinguishing properties of air as a heavy and compressible fluid, and of the general phenomena which are immediate consequences of these properties. This we have done in a set of propositions analogous to those which form the doctrines of hydrostatics. It remains to consider it in another point of view, namely, as moveable and inert. The phenomena consequent on these properties are exhibited in the velocities which air acquires by pressure, in the resistance which bodies meet with to their motion through the air, and in the impulsion which air in motion gives to bodies exposed to its action.\n\nWe shall first consider the motions of which air is susceptible when the equilibrium of pressure (whether arising from its weight or its elasticity) is removed; and, in the next place, we shall consider its action on solid bodies exposed to its current, and the resistance which it makes to their motion through it.\n\nIn this consideration we shall avoid the extreme of generality, which renders the discussion too abstract and air in action difficult, and adapt our investigation to the circumstances in which compressible fluids (of which air is a fluid) are most commonly found, equal and acted on by We shall consider air therefore as it is commonly found parallel in accessible situations, as acted on by equal and parallel gravity; and we shall consider it in the same order in which water is treated in a system of hydraulics.\n\nIn that science the leading problem is to determine analogons with what velocity the water will move through a given to the orifice when impelled by some known pressure; and it has been found, that the best form in which this most difficult and intricate proposition can be put, is to determine the velocity of water flowing through this orifice when impelled by its weight alone. Having determined this, we can reduce to this case every question which can be proposed; for, in place of the pressure of any piston or other mover, we can always substitute a perpendicular column of water or air whose weight shall be equal to the given pressure.\n\nThe first problem, therefore, is to determine with what velocity air will rush into a void when impelled by its weight alone. This is evidently analogous to the hydraulic problem of water flowing out of a vessel.\n\nAnd here we must be contented with referring our readers to the solutions which have been given of that weight, problem,\nproblem, and the demonstration that it flows with the velocity which a heavy body would acquire by falling from a height equal to the depth of the hole under the surface of the water in the vessel. In whatever way we attempt to demonstrate that proposition, every step, nay, every word, of the demonstration applies equally to the air, or to any fluid whatever. Or, if our readers should wish to see the connection or analogy of the cases, we only desire them to recollect an undoubted maxim in the science of motion, that when the moving force and the matter to be moved vary in the same proportion, the velocity will be the same. If therefore there be similar vessels of air, water, oil, or any other fluid, all of the height of a homogeneous atmosphere, they will all run through equal and similar holes with the same velocity; for in whatever proportion the quantity of matter moving through the hole be varied by a variation of density, the pressure which forces it out, by acting in circumstances perfectly similar, varies in the same proportion by the same variation of density.\n\nWe must therefore assume it as the leading proposition, that air rushes from the atmosphere into a void with the velocity which a heavy body would acquire by falling from the top of a homogeneous atmosphere.\n\nIt is known that air is about 845 times lighter than water, and that the pressure of the atmosphere supports water at the height of 33 feet nearly. The height therefore of a homogeneous atmosphere is nearly \\( \\frac{33}{845} \\times 845 = 27720 \\) feet. Moreover, to know the velocity acquired by any fall, recollect that a heavy body by falling one foot acquires the velocity of 8 feet per second; and that the velocities acquired by falling through different heights are as the square roots of the heights. Therefore to find the velocity corresponding to any height, expressed in feet per second, multiply the square root of the height by 8. We have therefore in the present instance \\( V = \\sqrt{27720} = 8 \\times 166.493 = 1332 \\) feet per second. This therefore is the velocity with which common air will rush into a void; and this may be taken as a standard number in pneumatics, as 16 and 32 are standard numbers in the general science of mechanics, expressing the action of gravity at the surface of the earth.\n\nIt is easy to see that greater precision is not necessary in this matter. The height of a homogeneous atmosphere is a variable thing, depending on the temperature of the air. If this reason seems any objection against the use of the number 1332, we may retain \\( \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{H}} \\) in place of it, where \\( H \\) expresses the height of a homogeneous atmosphere of the given temperature. A variation of the barometer makes no change in the velocity, nor in the height of the homogeneous atmosphere, because it is accompanied by a proportional variation in the density of the air. When it is increased \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}} \\), for instance, the density is also increased \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}} \\); and thus the expelling force and the matter to be moved are changed in the same proportion, and the velocity remains the same. N.B. We do not here consider the velocity which the air acquires after its issuing into the void by its continual expansion. This may be ascertained by the 39th prop. of Newton's Principia, b. i. Nay, which appears very paradoxical, if a cylinder of air, communicating in this manner with a void, be compressed by a piston loaded with a weight, which presses it down as the air flows out, and thus keeps it of the same density, the velocity of efflux will still be the same, however great the prelude may chance to be: for the first and immediate effect of the load on the piston is to reduce the air in the cylinder to such a density that its elasticity shall exactly balance the load; and because the elasticity of air is proportional to its density, the density of the air will be increased in the same proportion with the load, that is, with the expelling power (for we are neglecting at present the weight of the included air as too insensible to have any sensible effect). Therefore, since the matter to be moved is increased in the same proportion with the prelude, the velocity will be the same as before.\n\nIt is equally easy to determine the velocity with which the air of the atmosphere will rush into a space containing rarer air. Whatever may be the density of this air, it rushes with its elasticity, which follows the proportion of its density, into a space will balance a proportional part of the prelude of the containing atmosphere; and it is the excess of this last only which rarer air, is the moving force. The matter to be moved is the same as before. Let \\( D \\) be the natural density of the air, and \\( d \\) the density of the air contained in the vessel into which it is supposed to run, and let \\( P \\) be the prelude of the atmosphere, and therefore equal to the force which impels it into a void; and let \\( \\pi \\) be the force with which this rarer air would rush into a void.\n\nWe have \\( D : d = P : \\pi \\), and \\( \\pi = \\frac{Pd}{D} \\). Now the moving force in the present instance is \\( P - \\pi \\), or \\( P - \\frac{Pd}{D} \\).\n\nLastly, let \\( V \\) be the velocity of air rushing into a void, and \\( v \\) the velocity with which it will rush into this rarefied air.\n\nIt is a theorem in the motion of fluids, that the pressures are as the squares of the velocities of efflux. Therefore \\( P : P - \\frac{Pd}{D} = V^2 : v^2 \\). Hence we derive\n\n\\[ v^2 = V^2 \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{d}{D} \\right) \\]\n\nand \\( \\phi \\times V = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{d}{D}} \\). We do not here consider the resistance which the air of the atmosphere will meet with from the inertia of that in the vessel which it must displace in its motion.\n\nHere we see that there will always be a current into the vessel while \\( d \\) is less than \\( D \\).\n\nWe also learn the gradual diminution of the velocity as the vessel fills; for \\( d \\) continually increases, and therefore \\( 1 - \\frac{d}{D} \\) continually diminishes.\n\nIt remains to determine the time \\( t \\) expressed in seconds, in which the air of the atmosphere will flow into this vessel from its state of vacuity till the air in the vessel has acquired any proposed density \\( d \\).\n\nFor this purpose let \\( H \\), expressed in feet, be the height through which a heavy body must fall in order to acquire the velocity \\( V \\), expressed also in feet per second. This we shall express more briefly in future, by calling it the height producing the velocity \\( V \\). Let \\( C \\) represent the capacity of the vessel, expressed in cubic feet, and \\( O \\) the area or section of the orifice, expressed in superficial or square feet; and let the natural density of the air be \\( D \\).\n\nSince the quantity of aerial matter contained in a vessel depends on the capacity of the vessel and the density of the air jointly, we may express the air which would\nwould fill this vessel by the symbol CD when the air is in its ordinary state, and by C\u03b4 when it has the density \u03b4. In order to obtain the rate at which it fills, we must take the fluxion of this quantity C\u03b4. This is C\u03b4, for C is a constant quantity, and \u03b4 is a variable or flowing quantity.\n\nBut we also obtain the rate of influx by our knowledge of the velocity, and the area of the orifice, and the density. The velocity is V, or \\( \\sqrt{H} \\), at the first instant; and when the air in the vessel has acquired the density \u03b4, that is, at the end of the time t, the velocity is \\( 8\\sqrt{H}\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\delta}{D}} \\), or \\( 8\\sqrt{H}\\sqrt{\\frac{D-\\delta}{D}} \\),\n\nor \\( 8\\sqrt{H}\\sqrt{\\frac{D-\\delta}{D}} \\).\n\nThe rate of influx therefore (which may be conceived as measured by the little mass of air which will enter during the time t with this velocity) will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{8\\sqrt{HOD}\\sqrt{D-\\delta}}{\\sqrt{D}} \\cdot i \\]\n\nor \\( 8\\sqrt{HO}\\sqrt{D-\\delta} \\cdot i \\), multiplying the velocity by the orifice and the density.\n\nHere then we have two values of the rate of influx. By stating them as equal we have a fluxionary equation, from which we may obtain the fluents, that is, the time t in seconds necessary for bringing the air in the vessel to the density \u03b4, or the density \u03b4 which will be produced at the end of any time t. We have the equation\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{8\\sqrt{HO}\\sqrt{D}} \\times \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{D-\\delta}} = C\\delta. \\]\n\nHence we derive\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{4\\sqrt{HO}\\sqrt{D}} \\times \\sqrt{D-\\delta} + A, \\]\n\nin which A is a conditional constant quantity. The condition which determines it is, that it must be nothing when \u03b4 is nothing, that is, when \\( \\sqrt{D-\\delta} = \\sqrt{D} \\); for this is evidently the case at the beginning of the motion. Hence it follows, that the constant quantity is \\( \\sqrt{D} \\), and the complete fluent, suited to the case, is\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{4\\sqrt{HO}\\sqrt{D}} \\times \\sqrt{D-\\delta}. \\]\n\nThe motion ceases when the air in the vessel has acquired the density of the external air; that is, when\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{4\\sqrt{HO}\\sqrt{D}} \\times \\sqrt{D}, = 4\\sqrt{HO}. \\]\n\nTherefore the time of completely filling the vessel is\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{4\\sqrt{HO}}. \\]\n\nLet us illustrate this by an example in numbers.\n\nSupposing then that air is 840 times lighter than water, and the height of the homogeneous atmosphere 27720 feet, we have \\( 4\\sqrt{H}=666 \\). Let us further suppose the vessel to contain 8 cubic feet, which is nearly a wine hoghead, and that the hole by which the air of the ordinary density, which we shall make \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\), enters is an inch square, or \\( \\frac{1}{144} \\) of a square foot. Then the time in seconds of completely filling it will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{8}{1152} \\text{ or } \\frac{1152}{666}, \\text{ or } 1.7297 \\text{ if the hole is } \\frac{1}{100} \\text{ of an inch, the time of completely filling the hoghead will be } 173'' \\text{ very nearly, or something less than three minutes.} \\]\n\nIf we make the experiment with a hole cut in a thin plate, we shall find the time greater nearly in the proportion of 63 to 100, for reasons obvious to all who have studied hydraulics. In like manner we can tell the time necessary for bringing the air in the vessel to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of its ordinary density. The only variable part of our fluent is the coefficient \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{D-\\delta}{D}} \\), or \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\delta}{D}} \\). Let \u03b4 be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), then \\( \\sqrt{1-\\delta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\delta}{D}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\); and the time is 86\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)'' very nearly when the hole is \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\) of an inch wide.\n\nLet us now suppose that the air in the vessel ABCD (fig. 81.) is compressed by a weight acting on the cover AD, which is moveable down the vessel, and is thus expelled into the external air.\n\nThe immediate effect of this external pressure is to additional compress the air and give it another density. The impulse of density D of the external air corresponds to its pressure moving P. Let the additional pressure on the cover of the down the vessel be p, and the density of the air in the vessel vessel be d. We shall have \\( P : P+p = D : d \\); and therefore\n\n\\[ p = P \\times \\frac{d-D}{D}. \\]\n\nThen, because the pressure which expels the air is the difference between the force which compresses the air in the vessel and the force which compresses the external air, the expelling force is p. And because the quantities of motion are as the forces which similarly produce them, we shall have\n\n\\[ P : P+p = MV : mv; \\]\n\nwhere M and m express the quantities of matter expelled, V expresses the velocity with which air rushes into a void, and v expresses the velocity fought. But because the quantities of aerial matter which issue from the same orifice in a moment are as the densities and velocities jointly, we shall have \\( MV : mv = DVV : dvv, = DV^2 : dv^2 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( P : p = DV^2 : dv^2 \\). Hence we deduce\n\n\\[ v = V \\sqrt{\\frac{d-D}{d}}. \\]\n\nWe may have another expression of the velocity without considering the density. We had \\( P : P+p = D : d \\); therefore \\( d = \\frac{D \\times P+p}{P} \\), and \\( d-D = \\frac{D \\times P+p-DP}{P} \\),\n\n\\[ = \\frac{D \\times P+p-DP}{P}, \\text{ and } \\frac{d-D}{d} = \\frac{D \\times P+p-DP}{D \\times P+p}, \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{P+p-P}{P+p}: \\text{ therefore } v = V \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{P}{P+p}}, \\]\n\nwhich is a very simple and convenient expression.\n\nHitherto we have considered the motion of air as produced by its weight only. Let us now consider the effect of its elasticity.\n\nLet ABCD (fig. 81.) be a vessel containing air of any density D. This air is in a state of compression; and if the compressing force be removed, it will expand, and its elasticity will diminish along with its density. Its elasticity in any state is measured by the force which keeps it in that state. The force which keeps common air in its ordinary density is the weight of the atmosphere, and is the same with the weight of a column of water 33 feet high. If therefore we suppose that this air,\nAir in Motion.\n\ninstead of being confined by the top of the vessel, is pressed down by a moveable piston carrying a column of water 33 feet high; its elasticity will balance this pressure as it balances the pressure of the atmosphere; and as it is a fluid, and propagates through every part the pressure exerted on any one part, it will press on any little portion of the vessel by its elasticity in the same manner as when loaded with this column.\n\nThe consequence of this reasoning is, that if this small portion of the vessel be removed, and thus a passage be made into a void, the air will begin to flow out with the same velocity with which it would flow when impelled by its weight alone, or with the velocity acquired by falling from the top of a homogeneous atmosphere, or 1332 feet in a second nearly.\n\nBut as soon as some air has come out, the density of the remaining air is diminished, and its elasticity is diminished; therefore the expelling force is diminished. But the matter to be moved is diminished in the very same proportion, because the density and elasticity are found to vary according to the same law; therefore the velocity will continue the same from the beginning to the end of the efflux.\n\nThis may be seen in another way. Let \\( P \\) be the pressure of the atmosphere, which being the counterbalance and measure of the initial elasticity, is equal to the expelling force at the first instant. Let \\( D \\) be the initial density, and \\( V \\) the initial velocity. Let \\( d \\) be its density at the end of the time \\( t \\) of efflux, and \\( v \\) the contemporaneous velocity. It is plain that at the end of this time we shall have the expelling force \\( \\frac{Pd}{D} \\); for \\( D : d = P : \\pi \\left( \\frac{Pd}{D} \\right) \\).\n\nThese forces are proportional to the quantities of motion which they produce; and the quantities of motion are proportional to the quantities of matter \\( M \\) and \\( m \\) and the velocities \\( V \\) and \\( v \\) jointly: therefore we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{D} = MV : mv.\n\\]\n\nBut the quantities of matter which escape through a given orifice are as the densities and velocities jointly; that is, \\( M : m = DV : dv \\); therefore \\( P : \\frac{Pd}{D} = DV^2 : dv^2 \\), and \\( P \\times dv^2 = \\frac{PdDV^2}{D} = PdV^2 \\), and \\( V^2 = v^2 \\), and \\( V = v \\), and the velocity of efflux is constant. Hence follows, what appears very unlikely at first sight, that however much the air in the vessel is condensed, it will always issue into a void with the same velocity.\n\nIn order to find the quantity of aerial matter which will issue during any time \\( t \\), and consequently the density of the remaining air at the end of this time, we must get the rate of efflux. In the element of time \\( dt \\) there issues (by what has been said above) the bulk \\( 8\\sqrt{HO}dt \\) (for the velocity \\( V \\) is constant); and therefore the quantity \\( 8\\sqrt{HO}dt \\). On the other hand, the quantity of air at the beginning was \\( CD \\), \\( C \\) being the capacity of the vessel; and when the air has acquired the density \\( d \\), the quantity is \\( Cd \\), and the quantity run out is \\( CD - Cd \\); therefore the quantity which has run out in the time \\( t \\) must be the fluxion of \\( CD - Cd \\), or \\( -Cd \\). Therefore, we have the equation \\( 8\\sqrt{HO}dt = -Cd \\), and \\( i = \\frac{-Cd}{8\\sqrt{HO}} \\times \\frac{d}{dt} \\).\n\nThe fluent of this is \\( i = \\frac{C}{8\\sqrt{HO}} \\log_d \\). This fluent must be so taken that \\( i \\) may be zero when \\( d = D \\). Therefore the correct fluent will be \\( i = \\frac{C}{8\\sqrt{HO}} \\log_d \\), for \\( \\log_d \\frac{D}{d} = \\log_d \\frac{1}{a} = a \\). We deduce from this, that it requires an infinite time for the whole air of a vessel to flow out of it into a void. N.B. By \\( \\log_d \\), &c., is meant the hyperbolic logarithm of \\( d \\), &c.\n\nLet us next suppose that the vessel, instead of letting out its air into a void, emits it into air of a less density, which remains constant during the efflux, as we into rarer may suppose to be the case when a vessel containing condensed air emits it into the surrounding atmosphere. Let the initial density of the air in the vessel be \\( \\delta \\), and that of the atmosphere \\( D \\). Then it is plain that the expelling force is \\( P - \\frac{PD}{\\delta} \\), and that after the time \\( t \\) it is \\( \\frac{Pd}{\\delta} - \\frac{PD}{\\delta} \\). We have therefore \\( P - \\frac{PD}{\\delta} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Pd}{\\delta} - \\frac{PD}{\\delta} = MV : mv = \\delta V^2 : dv^2.\n\\]\n\nWhence we derive \\( v = V \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta - D}{d - D}} \\).\n\nFrom this equation we learn that the motion will be at an end when \\( d = D \\); and if \\( \\delta = D \\) there can be no efflux.\n\nTo find the relation between the time and the density, let \\( H \\) as before be the height producing the velocity \\( V \\). The height producing the velocity of efflux when issuing into a void.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta - D}{d - D}}.\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, it is \\( -Cd \\).\n\nHence we deduce the fluxionary equation \\( i = \\frac{C}{8\\sqrt{HO}} \\times \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{\\delta^2 - D^2}} \\). The fluent of this, corrected so as to make \\( i = 0 \\) when \\( d = \\delta \\), is \\( i = \\frac{C}{8\\sqrt{HO}} \\times \\log \\left( \\frac{\\delta - D + \\sqrt{\\delta^2 - D^2}}{d - D + \\sqrt{d^2 - D^2}} \\right) \\). And the time of completing the efflux, when \\( d = D \\), is \\( i = \\frac{C}{8\\sqrt{HO}} \\times \\log \\left( \\frac{\\delta - D + \\sqrt{\\delta^2 - D^2}}{d - D + \\sqrt{d^2 - D^2}} \\right) \\).\n\nLastly, let \\( ABCD \\), CFGH (fig. 82.) be two vessels containing airs of different densities, and communicating when issuing by the orifice \\( C \\), there will be a current from the vessel containing the denser air into that containing the rarer; and from the rarer air.\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the elastic force of the air in \\( ABCD \\), \\( Q \\) its density, and \\( V \\) its velocity, and \\( D \\) the density of the air in CFGH. And, after the time \\( t \\), let the density of\nof the air in \\( \\text{ABCD} \\) be \\( q \\), its velocity \\( v \\), and the density of the air in \\( \\text{CFGH} \\) be \\( \\delta \\). The expelling force from \\( \\text{ABCD} \\) will be \\( P = \\frac{\\text{PD}}{Q} \\) at the first instant, and at the end of the time \\( t \\) it will be \\( \\frac{Pq}{Q} - \\frac{P\\delta}{Q} \\). Therefore we shall have \\( P = \\frac{\\text{PD}}{Q} : \\frac{Pq}{Q} - \\frac{P\\delta}{Q} = QV^2 : qv^2 \\), which gives \\( v = V \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{Q(q-\\delta)}{q(Q-D)}} \\), and the motion will cease when \\( \\delta = q \\).\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the capacity of the first vessel, and \\( B \\) that of the second. We have the second equation \\( AQ + BD = Aq + BD \\), and therefore \\( \\delta = \\frac{A(Q-q) + BD}{B} \\).\n\nSubstituting this value of \\( \\delta \\) in the former value of \\( v \\), we have \\( v = V \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{Q(B(q-D) - A(Q-q))}{qB(Q-D)}} \\), which gives the relation between the velocity \\( v \\) and the density \\( q \\).\n\nIn order to ascertain the time when the air in \\( \\text{ABCD} \\) has acquired the density \\( q \\), it will be convenient to abridge the work by some substitutions. Therefore make \\( Q(B+A) = M \\), \\( BQ + BQ^2 = N \\), \\( BQ - BD = R \\) and \\( \\frac{N}{M} = m \\). Then, proceeding as before, we obtain the fluxionary equation \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{HOq}}{\\sqrt{Rq}} = \\frac{AQ-Aq}{8\\sqrt{HO/M}} \\times \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{q-mq}} \\), of which the fluent, completed so that \\( t = 0 \\) when \\( q = Q \\), is \\( t = \\frac{A\\sqrt{R}}{8\\sqrt{HO/M}} \\times \\log \\left( \\frac{Q-\\frac{1}{m}q+\\sqrt{(Q-mQ)}}{q-\\frac{1}{m}q+\\sqrt{(q-mq)}} \\right) \\).\n\nSome of these questions are of difficult solution, and they are not of frequent use in the more important and usual applications of the doctrines of pneumatics, at least in their present form. The cases of greatest use are when the air is expelled from a vessel by an external force, as when bellows are worked, whether of the ordinary form or consisting of a cylinder fitted with a moveable piston. This last case merits a particular consideration; and, fortunately, the investigation is extremely easy.\n\nLet \\( AD \\) fig. 81. be considered as a piston moving downward with the uniform velocity \\( f \\), and let the area of the piston be \\( n \\) times the area of the hole of efflux, then the velocity of efflux arising from the motion of the piston will be \\( nf \\). Add this to the velocity \\( V \\) produced by the elasticity of the air in the first question, and the whole velocity will be \\( V + nf \\). It will be the same in the other. The problem is also freed from the consideration of the time of efflux. For this depends now on the velocity of the piston. It is still, however, a very intricate problem to ascertain the relation between the time and the density, even though the piston is moving uniformly; for at the beginning of the motion the air is of common density. As the piston descends, it both expels and compresses the air, and the density of the air in the vessel varies in a very intricate manner, as also its resistance or reaction on the piston. For this reason, a piston which moves uniformly by means of an external force will never make an uniform blast by successive strokes; it will always be weaker at the beginning of the stroke. The best way for securing an uniform blast is to employ the external force only for lifting up the piston, and then to let the piston descend by its own weight. In this way it will quickly sink down, compressing the air, till its density and corresponding elasticity exactly balance the weight of the piston. After this the piston will descend equably, and the blast will be uniform. We shall have occasion to consider this more particularly under the head of Pneumatical Machines. These observations and theorems will serve to determine the initial velocity of the air in all important cases of its expulsion. The philosopher will learn the rate of its efflux out of one vessel into another; the chemist will be able to calculate the quantities of the different gases which are employed in the curious experiments of the ingenious but unfortunate Lavoisier on Combustion, and will find them extremely different from what he supposed; the engineer will learn how to proportion the motive force of his machine to the quantity of aerial matter which his bellows must supply. But it is not enough, for this purpose, that the air begin to issue in the proper quantity; we must see whether it be not affected by the circumstances of its subsequent passage.\n\nAll the modifications of motion which are observed passage of water conduits take place also in the passage of air through pipes and holes of all kinds. There is the same diminution of quantity passing through a hole in a thin plate that is observed in water. We know of water in that (abating the small effect of friction) water if conduits fuses with the velocity acquired by falling from the surface; and yet if we calculate by this velocity and by the area of the orifice, we shall find the quantity of water deficient nearly in the proportion of 63 to 100. This is owing to the water pressing towards the orifice from all sides, which occasions a contraction of the jet. The same thing happens in the efflux of air. Also the motion of water is greatly impeded by all contractions of its passage. They oblige it to accelerate its velocity, and therefore require an increase of pressure to force it through them, and this in proportion to the squares of the velocities. Thus, if a machine working a pump causes it to give a certain number of strokes in a minute, it will deliver a determined quantity of water in that time. Should it happen that the passage of the water is contracted to one half in any part of the machine (a thing which frequently happens at the valves), the water must move through this contraction with twice the velocity that it has in the rest of the passage. This will require four times the force to be exerted on the piston. Nay (which will appear very odd, and is never suspected by engineers), if no part of the passage is narrower than the barrel of the pump, but on the contrary a part much wider, and if the conduit be again contracted to the width of the barrel, an additional force must be applied to the piston to drive the water through this passage, which would not have been necessary if the passage had not been widened in any part. It will require a force equal to the weight of a column of water of the height necessary for communicating a velocity, the square of which is equal to the difference of the squares of the velocities of the water in the wide and the narrow part of the conduit.\nThe same thing takes place in the motion of air, and therefore all contractions and dilatations must be carefully avoided, when we want to preserve the velocity unimpaired.\n\nAir also suffers the same retardation in its motion along pipes. By not knowing, or not attending to that, engineers of the first reputation have been prodigiously disappointed in their expectations of the quantity of air which will be delivered by long pipes. Its extreme mobility and lightness hindered them from suspecting that it would suffer any sensible retardation. Dr Papin, a most ingenious man, proposed this as the most effectual method of transferring the action of a moving power to a great distance. Suppose, for instance, that it was required to raise water out of a mine by a water-machine, and that there was no fall of water nearer than a mile's distance. He employed this water to drive a piston, which should compress the air in a cylinder communicating, by a long pipe, with another cylinder at the mouth of the mine. This second cylinder had a piston in it, whose rod was to give motion to the pumps at the mine. He expected, that as soon as the piston at the water-machine had compressed the air sufficiently, it would cause the air in the cylinder at the mine to force up its piston, and thus work the pumps. Dr Hooke made many objections to the method, when laid before the Royal Society, and it was much debated there. But dynamics was at this time an infant science, and very little understood. Newton had not then taken any part in the business of the society, otherwise the true objections would not have escaped his sagacious mind. Notwithstanding Papin's great reputation as an engineer and mechanic, he could not bring his scheme into use in England; but afterwards, in France and in Germany, where he settled, he got some persons of great fortunes to employ him in this project; and he erected great machines in Auvergne and Westphalia for draining mines. But, so far from being effective machines, they would not even begin to move. He attributed the failure to the quantity of air in the pipe of communication, which must be condensed before it can condense the air in the remote cylinder. This indeed is true, and he should have thought of this earlier. He therefore diminished the size of this pipe, and made his water-machine exhaust instead of condensing, and had no doubt but that the immense velocity with which air rushes into a void would make a rapid and effectual communication of power. But he was equally disappointed here, and the machine at the mine stood still as before.\n\nNear a century after this, a very intelligent engineer attempted a much more feasible thing of this kind at an iron-foundery in Wales. He erected a machine at a powerful fall of water, which worked a set of cylinder bellows, the blowpipe of which was conducted to the distance of a mile and a half, where it was applied to a blast furnace. But notwithstanding every care to make the conducting pipe very air-tight, of great size, and as smooth as possible, it would hardly blow out a candle. The failure was ascribed to the impossibility of making the pipe air-tight. But, what was surprising, above ten minutes elapsed after the action of the pistons in the bellows before the least wind could be perceived at the end of the pipe; whereas the engineer expected an interval of 6 seconds only.\n\nNo very distinct theory can be delivered on this subject; but we may derive considerable assistance in understanding the causes of the obstruction to the motion of water in long pipes, by considering what happens to air. The elasticity of the air, and its great compressibility, have given us the distinctest notions of fluidity in general, flowing us, in a way that can hardly be controverted, that the particles of a fluid are kept at a distance from each other, and from other bodies, by the corporeal forces. We shall therefore take this opportunity to give a view of the subject, which did not occur to us when treating of the motion of water in pipes, referring a further discussion to the articles RIVER, WATER-WORKS.\n\nThe writers on hydrodynamics have always considered the obstruction to the motion of fluids along canals are obstructed; but we cannot form our selves any distinct notion of resemblance, or even analogy between them. The fact is, however, that a fluid running along a canal has its motion obstructed; and that this obstruction is greatest in the immediate vicinity of the solid canal, and gradually diminishes to the middle of the stream. It appears, therefore, that the parts of fluids can no more move among each other than among solid bodies, without suffering a diminution of their motion. The parts in physical contact with the sides and bottom are retarded by these immoveable bodies. The particles of the next stratum of fluid cannot preserve their initial velocities without overpowering the particles of the first stratum; and it appears from the fact that they are by this means retarded. They retard in the same manner the particles of the third stratum, and so on to the middle stratum or thread of fluid. It appears from the fact, therefore, that this sort of friction is not a consequence of rigidity alone, but that it is equally competent to fluids. Nay, since it is a matter of fact in air, and is even more remarkable there than in any other fluid, as we shall see by the experiments which have been made on the subject; and as our experiments on the compression of air show us the particles of air ten times nearer to each other in some cases than in others (viz. when we see air a thousand times denser in these cases), and therefore force us to acknowledge that they are not in contact; it is plain that this obstruction has no analogy to friction, which supposes roughness or inequality of surface. No such inequality can be supposed in the surface of an aerial particle; nor would it be of any service in explaining the obstruction, since the particles do not rub on each other, but pass each other at some small and imperceptible distance.\n\nWe must therefore have recourse to some other mode of explication. We shall apply this to air only in this place; and, since it is proved by the incontrovertible experiments of Canton, Zimmerman, and others, that water, mercury, oil, &c. are also compressible and perfectly elastic, the argument from this principle, which is conclusive in air, must equally explain the similar phenomenon in hydraulics.\n\nThe most highly polished body which we know must be conceived as having an uneven surface when we compare it with the small spaces in which the corporeal forces are exerted; and a quantity of air moving\nin a polished pipe may be compared to a quantity of small shot sliding down a channel with undulated sides and bottom. The row of particles immediately contiguous to the sides will therefore have an undulated motion; but this undulation of the contiguous particles of air will not be so great as that of the surface along which they glide; for not only every motion requires force to produce it, but also every change of motion. The particles of air reflect this change from a rectilinear to an undulating motion; and, being elastic, that is, repelling each other and other bodies, they keep a little nearer to the surface as they passing over an eminence, and their path is less incurvated than the surface. The difference between the motion of the particles of air and the particles of a fluid quite unlike is, in this respect, somewhat like the difference between the motion of a spring-carriage and that of a common carriage. When the common carriage passes along a road not perfectly smooth, the line described by the centre of gravity of the carriage keeps perfectly parallel to that described by the axis of the wheels, rising and falling along with it. Now let a spring body be put on the same wheels and pass along the same road. When the axis rises over an eminence perhaps half an inch, sinks down again into the next hollow, and then rises a second time, and so on, the centre of gravity of the body describes a much straighter line; for upon the rising of the wheels, the body reflects the motion, and compresses the springs, and thus remains lower than it would have been had the springs not been interposed. In like manner, it does not sink so low as the axle does when the wheels go into a hollow. And thus the motion of spring-carriages becomes less violently undulated than the road along which they pass. This illustration will, we hope, enable the reader to conceive how the deviation of the particles next to the sides and bottom of the canal from a rectilinear motion is less than that of the canal itself.\n\nIt is evident that the same reasoning will prove that the undulation of the next row of particles will be less than that of the first, that the undulation of the third row will be less than that of the second, and so on, as is represented in fig. 83. And thus it appears, that while the mass of air has a progressive motion along the pipe or canal, each particle is describing a waving line, of which a line parallel to the direction of the canal is the axis, cutting all these undulations. This axis of each undulated path will be straight or curved as the canal is, and the excursions of the path on each side of its axis will be less and less as the axis of the path is nearer to the axis of the canal.\n\nLet us now see what sensible effect this will have; for all the motion which we here speak of is imperceptible. It is demonstrated in mechanics, that if a body moving with any velocity be deflected from its rectilinear path by a curved and perfectly smooth channel, to which the rectilinear path is a tangent, it will proceed along this channel with undiminished velocity. Now the path, in the present case, may be considered as perfectly smooth, since the particles do not touch it. It is one of the undulations which we are considering, and we may at present conceive this as without any subordinate inequalities. There should not, therefore, be any diminution of the velocity. Let us grant this of the absolute velocity of the particle; but what we observe is the velocity of the mass, and we judge of it perhaps by the motion of a feather carried along by it. Let us suppose a single atom to be a sensible object, and let us attend to two such particles, one at the side, and the other in the middle; although we cannot perceive the undulations of these particles during their progressive motions, we see the progressive motions themselves. Let us suppose then that the middle particle has moved without any undulation whatever, and that it has advanced ten feet. The lateral particle will also have moved ten feet; but this has not been in a straight line. It will not be so far advanced, therefore, in the direction of the canal; it will be left behind, and will appear to us to have been retarded in its motion: and in like manner each thread of particles will be more and more retarded (apparently only) as it recedes farther from the axis of the canal, or what is usually called the thread of the stream.\n\nAnd thus the observed fact is shown to be a necessary consequence of what we know to be the nature of whole the compressible or elastic fluid; and that without supposing any diminution in the real velocity of each particle, there will be a diminution of the velocity of the sensible threads of the general stream, and a diminution of the whole quantity of air which passes along it during a given time.\n\nLet us now suppose a parcel of air impelled along a pipe, which is perfectly smooth, out of a larger vessel, and issuing from this pipe with a certain velocity. It requires a certain force to change its velocity in the vessel to the greater velocity which it has in the pipe. This is abundantly demonstrated. How long soever we suppose this pipe, there will be no change in the velocity, or in the force to keep it up. But let us suppose that about the middle of this pipe there is a part of it which has suddenly got an undulated surface, however imperceptible. Let us further suppose that the final velocity of the middle thread is the same as before. In this case it is evident that the sum total of the motions of all the particles is greater than before, because the absolute motions of the lateral particles is greater than that of the central particle, which we suppose the same as before. This absolute increase of motion cannot be without an increase of propelling force: the force acting now, therefore, must be greater than the force acting formerly. Therefore, if only the former force had continued to act, the same motion of the central particle could not have been preserved, or the progressive motion of the whole stream must be diminished.\n\nAnd thus we see that this internal sensible undulatory motion becomes a real obstruction to the sensible motion which we observe, and occasions an expense of power.\n\nLet us see what will be the consequence of extending this obstructing surface further along the canal, the force it must evidently be accompanied by an augmentation of the motion produced, if the central velocity be still kept up; for the particles which are now in contact with the sides do not continue to occupy that situation; the middle particles moving faster forward get over them, and in their turn come next the side; and as they are really moving equally fast, but not in the direction into which they are now to be forced, force is necessary for changing the direction also; and this is in addition\naddition to the force necessary for producing the undulations so minutely treated of. The consequence of this must be, that an additional force will be necessary for preserving a given progressive motion in a longer ob-structing pipe, and that the motion produced in a pipe of greater length by a given force will be less than in a shorter one, and the efflux will be diminished.\n\nThere is another consideration which must have an influence here. Nothing is more irrefragably demonstrated than the necessity of an additional force for producing an efflux through any contraction, even though it should be succeeded by a dilatation of the passage. Now both the inequalities of the sides and the undulations of the motions of each particle are equivalent to a succession of contractions and dilatations; although each of these is next to infinitely small; their number is also next to infinitely great, and therefore the total effect may be sensible.\n\nWe have hitherto supposed that the absolute velocity of the particles was not diminished; this we did, having assumed that the interval of each undulation of the sides was without inequalities. But this was gratuitous: it was also gratuitous that the sides were only undulated. We have no reason for excluding angular apertures. These will produce, and most certainly often produce, real diminutions in the velocity of the contiguous particles; and this must extend to the very axis of the canal, and produce a diminution of the sum total of motion: and in order to preserve the same sensible progressive motion, a greater force must be employed. This is all that can be meant by saying that there is a resistance to the motion of air through long pipes.\n\nThere remains another cause of diminution, viz. the want of perfect fluidity, whether arising from the diminution of solid particles in a real fluid, or from the viscosity of the fluid. We shall not insist on this at present, because it cannot be shown to obtain in air, at least in any case which deserves consideration. It seems of no importance to determine the motion of air hurrying along with it foot or dust. The effect of fogs on a particular modification of the motion of air will be considered under the article Sound. What has been said on this subject is sufficient for our purpose, as explaining the prodigious and unexpected obstruction to the passage of air through long and narrow pipes. We are able to collect an important maxim from it, viz. that all pipes of communication should be made as wide as circumstances will permit; for it is plain that the obstruction depends on the internal surface, and the force to overcome it must be in proportion to the mass of matter which is in motion. The first increases as the diameter of the pipe, and the last as the square. The obstruction must therefore bear a greater proportion to the whole motion in a small pipe than in a large one.\n\nIt were very desirable to know the law by which the retardation extends from the axis to the sides of the canal, and the proportion which subsists between the lengths of the canal and the forces necessary for overcoming the obstructions when the velocity is given; as also whether the proportion of the obstruction to the whole motion varies with the velocity: but all this is unknown. It does not, however, seem a desperate case in air: we know pretty distinctly the law of action among its particles, viz. that their mutual repulsions are inversely as their distances. This promises to enable us to trace the progress of undulation from the sides of the canal to the axis.\n\nWe can see that the retardations will not increase so fast as the square of the velocity. Were the fluid incompressible, so that the undulatory path of a particle would be precisely such as arise from its undulating path itself and the motion in it; for each particle would be in the situation of a body moving along a fixed path. But in a very compressible fluid, such as air, each particle may be considered as a solitary body, actuated by a projectile and a transverse force, arising from the action of the adjoining particles. Its motion must depend on the adjustment of these forces, in the same manner as the elliptical motion of a planet depends on the adjustment of the force of projection, with a gravitation inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the focus. The transverse force in the present case has its origin in the pressure on the air which is propelling it along the pipe: this, by squeezing the particles together, brings their mutual repulsion into action. Now it is the property of a perfect fluid, that a pressure exerted on any part of it is propagated equally through the whole fluid; therefore the transverse forces which are excited by this pressure are proportional to the pressure itself; and we know that the pressures exerted on the surface of a fluid, so as to expel it through any orifice, or along any canal, are proportional to the squares of the velocities which they produce. Therefore, in every point of the undulatory motion of any particle, the transverse force by which it is deflected into a curve is proportional to the square of its velocity. When this is the case, a body would continue to describe the same curve as before; but, by the very compression, the curvatures are increased, supposing them to remain similar. This would require an increase of the transverse forces; but this is not to be found: therefore the particle will not describe a similar curve, but one which is less incurved in all its parts; consequently the progressive velocity of the whole, which is the only thing perceivable by us, will not be so much diminished; that is, the obstructions will not increase so fast as they would otherwise do, or as the squares of the velocities.\n\nThis reasoning is equally applicable to all fluids, and is abundantly confirmed by experiments in hydraulics, as we shall see when considering the motion of rivers. We have taken this opportunity of delivering our notions on this subject; because, as we have often said, it is in the avowed discrete constitution of air that we see most distinctly the operation of those natural powers which constitute fluidity in general.\n\nWe would beg leave to mention a form of experiment for discovering the law of retardation with considerable accuracy. Experiments have been made on pipes and canals. Mr Boffin, in his Hydrodynamique, has given canals a very beautiful test made on pipes of an inch and two inches diameter, and 200 feet long: but although these experiments are very instructive, they do not give us any rule by which we can extend the result to pipes of greater length and different diameters.\n\nLet a smooth cylinder be set upright in a very large vessel or pond, and be moveable round its axis: let it be turned round by means of a wheel and pulley with an uniform...\nVelocity of uniform motion and determined velocity. It will exert the same force on the contiguous water which would be exerted on it by water turning round it with the same velocity; and as this water would have its motion gradually retarded by the fixed cylinder, so the moving cylinder will gradually communicate motion to the surrounding water. We should observe the water gradually dragged round by it; and the vortex would extend farther and farther from it as the motion is continued, and the velocities of the parts of the vortex will be less and less as we recede from the axis. Now, we apprehend, that when a point of the surface of the cylinder has moved over 200 feet, the motion of the water at different distances from it will be similar and proportional to, if not precisely the same with, the retardations of water flowing 200 feet at the same distance from the side of a canal: at any rate, the two are susceptible of an accurate comparison, and the law of retardation may be accurately deduced from observations made on the motions of this vortex.\n\nAir in motion is a very familiar object of observation; and it is interesting. In all languages it has got a name; we call it wind; and it is only upon reflection that we consider air as wind in a quiescent state. Many persons hardly know what is meant when air is mentioned; but they cannot refuse that the blast from a bellows is the expulsion of what they contained; and thus they learn that wind is air in motion.\n\nIt is of consequence to know the velocity of wind; but no good and unexceptionable method has been contrived for this purpose. The best seems to be by measuring the space passed over by the shadow of a cloud; but this is extremely fallacious. In the first place, it is certain, that although we suppose that the cloud has the velocity of the air in which it is carried along, this is not an exact measure of the current on the surface of the earth; we may be almost certain that it is greater: for air, like all other fluids, is retarded by the sides and bottom of the channel in which it moves. But, in the next place, it is very gratuitous to suppose, that the velocity of the cloud is the velocity of the stratum of air between the cloud and the earth; we are almost certain that it is not. It is abundantly proved by Dr Hutton of Edinburgh, that clouds are always formed when two parcels of air of different temperatures mix together, each containing a proper quantity of vapour in the state of chemical solution. We know that different strata of air will frequently flow in different directions for a long time. In 1751 while a great fleet rendezvoused in Leith Roads during the Dutch war, there was a brisk easterly wind for about five weeks; and, during the last fortnight of this period, there was a brisk westerly current at the height of about three-fourths of a mile. This was distinctly indicated by frequent fleecy clouds at a great distance above a lower stratum of these clouds, which were driving all this time from the eastward. A gentleman who was at the siege of Quebec in 1759, informed us, that one day while there blew a gale from the west, so hard that the ships at anchor in the river were obliged to strike their topsails, and it was with the utmost difficulty that some well manned boats could row against it, carrying some artillery stores to a post above the town, several shells were thrown from the town to destroy the boats: one of the shells burst in the air near the top of its flight, which was about half a mile high. The smoke of this bomb remained in the same spot for above a quarter of an hour, like a great round ball, and gradually diffused by diffusion, without removing many yards from its place. When, therefore, two strata of air come from different quarters, and one of them flows over the other, it will be only in the contiguous surfaces that a precipitation of vapour will be made. This will form a thin fleecy cloud; and it will have a velocity and direction which neither belongs to the upper nor to the lower stratum of air which produced it. Should one of these strata come from the east and the other from the west with equal velocities, the cloud formed between them will have no motion at all; should one come from the east, and the other from the north, the cloud will move from the north-east with a greater velocity than either of the strata. So uncertain then is the information given by the clouds either of the velocity or the direction of the wind. A thick smoke from a furnace will give us a much less equivocal measure; and this, combined with the effects of the wind in impelling bodies, or deflecting a loaded plane from the perpendicular, or other effects of this kind, may give us measures of the different currents of wind with a precision sufficient for all practical uses.\n\nThe celebrated engineer Mr John Smeaton has given, in the 51st volume of the Philosophical Transactions, the speeds of wind corresponding to the usual denominations' observations in our language. These are founded on a great number of observations made by himself in the course of his practice in erecting wind-mills. They are contained in the following table:\n\n| Miles per hour | Feet per second |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| 1             | 1.47           |\n| 2             | 2.93           |\n| 3             | 4.40           |\n| 4             | 5.87           |\n| 5             | 7.33           |\n| 10            | 14.67          |\n| 15            | 22.00          |\n| 20            | 29.34          |\n| 25            | 36.67          |\n| 30            | 44.01          |\n| 35            | 51.34          |\n| 40            | 58.68          |\n| 45            | 66.01          |\n| 50            | 73.35          |\n| 60            | 88.02          |\n| 80            | 117.36         |\n| 100           | 146.70         |\n\nSee also some valuable experiments by him on this subject, Philosophical Transactions 1760 and 1761.\n\nOne of the most ingenious and convenient methods Account of for measuring the velocity of the wind is to employ its Dr Lind's pressure in supporting a column of water, in the same way anemometer as Mr Pitot measures the velocity of a current of water. We believe that it was first proposed by Dr James Lind of Windfor, a gentleman eminent for his great knowledge in all the branches of natural science, and for his ingenuity in every matter of experiment or practical application.\n\nHis anemometer (as these instruments are called) con- Fig. 84,\nVelocity of shifts of a glass tube of the form ABCD (fig. 84.), open at both ends, and having the branch AB at right angles to the branch CD. This tube contains a few inches of water or any fluid (the lighter the better); it is held with the part CD upright and AB horizontal and in the direction of the wind; that is, with the mouth A facing the wind. The wind acts in the way of pressure on the air in AB, compresses it, and causes it to press on the surface of the liquor; forcing it down to F, while it rises to E in the other leg. The velocity of the wind is concluded from the difference EF between the heights of the liquor in the legs. As the wind does not generally blow with uniform velocity, the liquor is apt to dance in the tube, and render the observation difficult and uncertain: to remedy this, it is proper to contract very much the communication at C between the two legs. If the tube has half an inch of diameter (and it should not have less), a hole of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\) of an inch is large enough; indeed the hole can hardly be too small, nor the tubes too large.\n\nThis instrument is extremely ingenious, and will undoubtedly give the proportions of the velocities of different currents with the greatest precision; for in whatever way the pressure of wind is produced by its motion, we are certain that the different pressures are as the squares of the velocities: if, therefore, we can obtain one certain measure of the velocity of the wind, and observe the degree to which the pressure produced by it raises the liquor, we can at all other times observe the pressures and compute the velocities from them, making proper allowances for the temperature and the height of the mercury in the barometer; because the velocity will be in the subduplicate ratio of the density of the air inversely when the pressure is the same.\n\nIt is usually concluded, that the velocity of the wind is that which would be acquired by falling from a height which is to \\( \\frac{F}{E} \\) as the weight of water is to that of an equal bulk of air. Thus, supposing air to be 840 times lighter than water, and that \\( \\frac{F}{E} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{840} \\) of an inch, the velocity will be about 63 feet per second, which is that of a very hard gale, approaching to a storm. Hence we see by the bye, that the scale of this instrument is extremely short, and that it would be a great improvement of it to make the leg CD not perpendicular, but very much sloping; or perhaps the following form of the instrument will give it all the perfection of which it is capable.\n\nLet the horizontal branch AB (fig. 85.) be contracted at B, and continued horizontally for several inches BG of a much smaller bore, and then turned down for two or three inches GC, and then upwards with a wide bore. To use the instrument, hold it with the part DC perpendicular; and (having sheltered the mouth A from the wind) pour in water at D till it advances along GB to the point B, which is made the beginning of the scale; the water in the upright branch standing at F in the same horizontal line with BG. Now, turn the mouth A to the wind; the air in AB will be compressed and will force the water along BG to F, and cause it to rise from F to E; and the range FE will be to the range BF on the scale as the section of the tube BG to that of CD. Thus, if the width of DC be \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\) an inch, and that of BG \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\), we shall have 25 inches in the scale for one inch of real pressure \\( \\frac{F}{E} \\).\n\nBut it has not been demonstrated in a very satisfactory manner, that the velocity of the wind is that acquired by falling through the height of a column of air whose weight is equal to that of the column of water \\( \\frac{F}{E} \\). Experiments made with Pitot's tube in currents of water show that several corrections are necessary for concluding the velocity of the current from the elevations in the tube; these corrections may however be made, and safely applied to the present case; and then the instrument will enable us to conclude the velocity of the wind immediately, without any fundamental comparison of the elevation, with a velocity actually determined upon other principles. The chief use which we have for this information is in our employment of wind as an impelling power, by which we can actuate machinery or navigate ships. These are very important applications of pneumatical doctrines, and merit a particular consideration; and this naturally brings us to the last part of our subject, viz. the consideration of the impulse of air on bodies exposed to its action, and the resistance which it opposes to the passage of bodies through it.\n\nThis is a subject of the greatest importance; being the foundation of that art which has done the greatest good to human society, by connecting together the most distant inhabitants of this globe, and making a communication of benefits which would otherwise have been impossible; we mean the art of Navigation or Seamanship. Of all the machines which human art has constructed, a ship is not only the greatest and most magnificent, but also the most ingenious and intricate; and the clever seaman possesses a knowledge founded on the most difficult and abstruse doctrines of mechanics. The seaman probably cannot give any account of his own science; and he possesses it rather by a kind of intuition than by any process of reasoning; but the success and efficacy of all the mechanism of this complicated engine, and the propriety of all the manoeuvres which the seaman practices, depend on the invariable laws of mechanics; and a thorough knowledge of these would enable an intelligent person not only to understand the machine and the manner of working it, but to improve both.\n\nUnfortunately this is a subject of very great difficulty; and although it has employed the genius of Newton, and he has considered it with great care, and his followers have added more to his labours on this subject than on any other, it still remains in a very imperfect state.\n\nA minute discussion of this subject cannot therefore be expected in a work like this; we must content ourselves with such a general statement of the most approved doctrine on the subject as shall enable our readers to conceive it distinctly, and judge with intelligence and confidence of the practical deductions which may be made from it.\n\nIt is evidently a branch of the general theory of the Impulse impulse and resistance of fluids, which belongs to Hydraulics, but will be better understood when the mechanical properties of compressible fluids have been considered. It was thought very reasonable to suppose that the circumstances of elasticity would introduce the same changes in the impulse and resistance of fluids that it does in solid bodies. It would greatly divert the attention from the distinctive properties of air, if we should in this place enter on this subject, which is both extensive and difficult. We reckon it better therefore to take the whole together: this we shall do under the article Resistance.\nVelocity of RESISTANCE of Fluids, and confine ourselves at present to what relates to the impulse and resistance of air alone; anticipating a few of the general propositions of that theory, but without demonstration, in order to understand the applications which may be made of it.\n\nSuppose then a plane surface, of which AC (fig. 86.) is the section, exposed to the action of a stream of wind blowing in the direction QC, perpendicular to AC. The motion of the wind will be obstructed, and the surface AC pressed forward. And as all impulse or pressure is exerted in a direction perpendicular to the surface, and is resisted in the opposite direction, the surface will be impelled in the direction CD, the continuation of QC. And as the mutual actions of bodies depend on their relative motions, the force acting on the surface AC will be the same, if we shall suppose the air at rest, and the surface moving equally swift in the opposite direction. The resistance of the air to the motion of the body will be equal to the impulse of the air in the former case. Thus resistance and impulse are equal and contrary.\n\nIf the air be moving twice as fast, its particles will give a double impulse; but in this case a double number of particles will exert their impulse in the same time: the impulse will therefore be fourfold; and in general it will be as the square of the velocity: or if the air and body be both in motion, the impulse and resistance will be proportional to the square of the relative velocity.\n\nThis is the first proposition on the subject, and it appears very conformant to reason. There will therefore be some analogy between the force of the air's impulse or the resistance of a body, and the weight of a column of air incumbent on the surface; for it is a principle in the action of fluids, that the heights of the columns of fluid are as the squares of the velocities which their pressures produce. Accordingly the second proposition is, that the absolute impulse of a stream of air, blowing perpendicularly on any surface, is equal to the weight of a column of air which has that surface for its base, and for its height the space through which a body must fall in order to acquire the velocity of the air.\n\nThirdly, Suppose the surface AC equal to AC no longer to be perpendicular to the stream of air, but inclined to it in the angle ACD, which we shall call the angle of incidence; then, by the resolution of forces, it follows, that the action of each particle is diminished in the proportion of radius to the sine of the angle of incidence, or of AC to AL, AL being perpendicular to CD.\n\nAgain: Draw AK parallel to CD. It is plain that no air lying farther from CD than KA is will strike the plane. The quantity of impulse therefore is diminished still farther in the proportion of AC to KC, or of AC to AL. Therefore, on the whole, the absolute impulse is diminished in the proportion of AC\u00b2 to AL\u00b2: hence the proposition, that the impulse and resistance of a given surface are in the proportion of the square of the sine of the angle of incidence.\n\nFourthly, This impulse is in the direction PL, perpendicular to the impelled surface, and the surface tends to move in this direction: but suppose it moveable only in some other direction PO, or that it is in the direction PO that we wish to employ this impulse, its action is therefore oblique; and if we wish to know the intensity of the impulse in this direction, it must be diminished velocity of wind farther in the proportion of radius to the cosine of the angle LPO or sine of CPO. Hence the general proposition: The effective impulse is as the surface, as the square of the velocity of the wind, as the square of the sine of the angle of incidence, and as the sine of the obliquity jointly, which we may express by the symbol \\( R = S \\cdot V^2 \\cdot \\sin^2 I \\cdot \\sin O \\); and as the impulse depends on the density of the impelling fluid, we may take in every circumstance by the equation \\( R = S \\cdot D \\cdot V^2 \\cdot \\sin^2 I \\cdot \\sin O \\). If the impulse be estimated in the direction of the stream, the angle of obliquity ACD is the same with the angle of incidence, and the impulse in this direction is as the surface, as the square of the velocity, and as the cube of the angle of incidence jointly.\n\nIt evidently follows from these premises, that if ACA' be a wedge, of which the base AA' is perpendicular to the wind, and the angle ACA' bisected by its direction, the direct or perpendicular impulse on the base is to the oblique impulse on the sides as radius to the square of the sine of half the angle ACA'.\n\nThe same must be affirmed of a pyramid or cone ACA', of which the axis is in the direction of the wind.\n\nIf ACA' (fig. 87.) represent the section of a solid, fig. 87., produced by the revolution of a curve line APC round the axis CD, which lies in the direction of the wind, the impulse on this body may be compared with the direct impulse on this base, or the resistance to the motion of this body through the air may be compared with the direct resistance of its base, by resolving its surface into elementary planes PP, which are coincident with a tangent plane PR, and comparing the impulse on PP with the direct impulse on the corresponding part KK of the base.\n\nIn this way it follows that the impulse on a sphere is one half of the impulse on its great circle, or on the base of a cylinder of equal diameter.\n\nWe shall conclude this sketch of the doctrine with a very important proposition to determine the most advantageous position of a plane surface, when required to move in one direction while it is impelled by the wind blowing in a different direction. Thus,\n\nLet AB (fig. 88.) be the sail of a ship, CA the direction in which the wind blows, and AD the line of reference of the ship's course. It is required to place the yard AC from this in such a position that the impulse of the wind upon the doctrine fail may have the greatest effect possible in impelling the ship along AD.\n\nLet AB, A b, be two positions of the sail very near Fig. 88., the best position, but on opposite sides of it. Draw BE, b e, perpendicular to CA, and BF, b f, perpendicular to AD, calling AB radius; it is evident that BE, BF, are the lines of impulse and obliquity, and that the effective impulse is BE\u00b2 \u00d7 BF, or b e\u00b2 \u00d7 b f. This must be a maximum.\n\nLet the points B, b, continually approach and ultimately coincide; the chord b B will ultimately coincide with a straight line CBD touching the circle in B; the triangles CBE, c b e are similar, as also the triangles DBF, D b f: therefore \\( BE^2 : b e^2 = BC^2 : b c^2 \\), and \\( BF : b f = BD : b D \\); and \\( BE^2 \\times BF : b e^2 \\times b f = CB^2 \\times BD : c b^2 \\times b D \\). Therefore when AB is in the best position, so that \\( BE^2 \\times BF \\) is greater than \\( b e^2 \\times b f \\), we shall have \\( CB \\times BD \\) greater than \\( c b^2 \\times b D \\), or \\( c B^2 \\times BD \\) is\nVelocity of wind moving one foot per second is about \\( \\frac{1}{75} \\) of a pound on a square foot. Therefore to find the impulse on a foot corresponding to any velocity, divide the square of the velocity by 520, and we obtain the impulse in pounds. Mr Roufe of Leicestershire made many experiments, which are mentioned with great approbation by Mr Smeaton. His great sagacity and experience in the erection of windmills oblige us to pay a considerable deference to his judgement. These experiments confirm our opinion, that the impulses increase faster than the surfaces. The following table was calculated from Mr Roufe's observations, and may be considered as pretty near the truth.\n\n| Velocity in Feet | Impulse on a Foot in Pounds |\n|------------------|----------------------------|\n| 0                | 0,000                      |\n| 10               | 0,229                      |\n| 20               | 0,915                      |\n| 30               | 2,059                      |\n| 40               | 3,662                      |\n| 50               | 5,718                      |\n| 60               | 8,234                      |\n| 70               | 11,207                     |\n| 80               | 14,638                     |\n| 90               | 18,526                     |\n| 100              | 22,872                     |\n| 110              | 27,675                     |\n| 120              | 32,926                     |\n| 130              | 38,654                     |\n| 140              | 44,830                     |\n| 150              | 51,462                     |\n\nIf we multiply the square of the velocity in feet by 16, the product will be the impulse or resistance on a square foot in grains, according to Mr Roufe's numbers.\n\nThe greatest deviation from the theory occurs in the oblique impulses. Mr Robins compared the resistance of a wedge, whose angle was 90\u00b0, with the resistance of its base; and instead of finding it less in the proportion of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) to 1, as determined by the theory, he found it greater in the proportion of 55 to 68 nearly; and when he formed the body into a pyramid, of which the sides had the same surface and the same inclination as the sides of the wedge, the resistance of the base and face were now as 55 to 39 nearly: so that here the same surface with the same inclination had its resistance reduced from 68 to 39 by being put into this form. Similar deviations occur in the experiments of the Chevalier Borda; and it may be collected from both, that the resistances diminish more nearly in the proportion of the sines of incidence than in the proportion of the squares of those sines.\n\nThe irregularity in the resistance of curved surfaces is as great as in plane surfaces. In general, the theory gives the oblique impulses on plane surfaces much too small, and the impulses on curved surfaces too great. The resistance of a sphere does not exceed the fourth part of the resistance of its great circle, instead of being its half; but the anomaly is such as to leave hardly any room for calculation. It would be very desirable to have the experiments on this subject repeated in a greater variety of cases, and on larger surfaces, so that the errors of the experiments may be of less consequence.\nTill this matter be reduced to some rule, the art of working ships must remain very imperfect, as must also the construction of windmills.\n\nThe case in which we are most interested in the knowledge of the resistance of the air is the motion of bullets and shells. Writers on artillery have long been sensible of the great effect of the air's resistance. It seems to have been this consideration that chiefly engaged Sir Isaac Newton to consider the motions of bodies in a resisting medium. A proposition or two would have sufficed for showing the incompatibility of the planetary motions with the supposition that the celestial spaces were filled with a fluid matter; but he has with great solicitude considered the motion of a body projected on the surface of the earth, and its deviation from the parabolic track assigned by Galileo. He has bestowed more pains on this problem than any other in his whole work; and his investigation has pointed out almost all the improvements which have been made in the application of mathematical knowledge to the study of nature. Nowhere does his sagacity and fertility of resource appear in so strong a light as in the second book of the Principia, which is almost wholly occupied by this problem. The celebrated mathematician John Bernoulli engaged in it as the finest opportunity of displaying his superiority. A mistake committed by Newton in his attempt to a solution was matter of triumph to him; and the whole of his performance, though a piece of elegant and elaborate geometry, is greatly hurt by his continually bringing this mistake (which is a mere trifle) into view. The difficulty of the subject is so great, that subsequent mathematicians seem to have kept aloof from it; and it has been entirely overlooked by the many voluminous writers who have treated professedly on military projectiles. They have spoken indeed of the resistance of the air as affecting the flight of shot, but have saved themselves from the talk of investigating this effect (a talk to which they were unequal), by supposing that it was not so great as to render their theories and practical deductions very erroneous. Mr Robins was the first who seriously examined the subject. He showed, that even the Newtonian theory (which had been corrected, but not in the smallest degree improved or extended in its principles) was sufficient to show that the path of a cannon ball could not resemble a parabola. Even this theory showed that the resistance was more than eight times the weight of the ball, and should produce a greater deviation from the parabola than the parabola deviated from a straight line.\n\nThis simple but singular observation was a strong proof how faulty the professed writers on artillery had been, in rather amusing themselves with elegant but useless applications of easy geometry, than in endeavouring to give their readers any useful information. He added, that the difference between the ranges by the Newtonian theory and by experiment was so great, that the resistance of the air must be vastly superior to what that theory supposed. It was this which suggested to him the necessity of experiments to ascertain this point. We have seen the result of these experiments in moderate velocities; and that they were sufficient for calling the whole theory in question, or at least for rendering it useless. It became necessary therefore to settle every point by means of a direct experiment. Here was a great difficulty. How shall we measure either these great velocities which are observed in the motions of cannon-shot, or the resistances which these enormous velocities occasion? Mr Robins had the ingenuity to do both. The method which he took for measuring the velocity of a musket-ball was quite original; and it was susceptible of great accuracy. We have already given an account of it under the article Gunney. Having gained this point, the other was not difficult. In the moderate velocities he had determined the resistances by the forces which balanced them, the weights which kept the resisting body in a state of uniform motion. In the great velocities, he proposed to determine the resistances by their immediate effects, by the retardations which they occasioned. This was to be done by first ascertaining the velocity of the ball, and then measuring its velocity after it had passed through a certain quantity of air. The difference of these velocities is the retardation, and the proper measure of the resistance; for, by the initial and final velocities of the ball, we learn the time which was employed in passing through this air with the medium velocity. In this time the air's resistance diminished the velocity by a certain quantity. Compare this with the velocity which a body projected directly upwards would lose in the same time by the resistance of gravity. The two forces must be in the proportion of their effects. Thus we learn the proportion of the resistance of the air to the weight of the ball. It is indeed true, that the time of passing through this space is not accurately had by taking the arithmetical medium of the initial and final velocities, nor does the resistance deduced from this calculation accurately correspond to this mean velocity; but both may be accurately found by the experiment by a very troublesome computation, as is shown in the fifth and sixth propositions of the second book of Newton's Principia. The difference between the quantities thus found and those deduced from the simple process is quite trifling, and far within the limits of accuracy attainable in experiments of this kind; it may therefore be safely neglected.\n\nMr Robins made many experiments on this subject; but unfortunately he has published only a very few, such as were sufficient for ascertaining the point he had in view. He intended a regular work on the subject, in which the gradual variations of resistance corresponding to different velocities should all be determined by experiment; but he was then newly engaged in an important and laborious employment, as chief engineer to the East India Company, in whose service he went out to India, where he died in less than two years. It is to be regretted that no person has prosecuted these experiments. It would be neither laborious nor difficult, and would add more to the improvement of artillery than anything that has been done since Mr Robins's death, if we except the prosecution of his experiments on the initial velocities of cannon-shot by Dr Charles Hutton royal professor at the Woolwich Academy. It is to be hoped that this gentleman, after having with such effect and success extended Mr Robins's experiments on the initial velocities of musket-shot to cannon, will take up this other subject, and thus give the art of artillery all the scientific foundation which it can receive in the present state of our mathematical knowledge. Till then we must content ourselves with the practical rules which Robins has deduced from his own experiments. As he has not given us the mode of deduction, we must compare the results with\nResistance with experiment. He has indeed given a very extensive comparison with the numerous experiments made both in Britain and on the continent; and the agreement is very great. His learned commentator Euler has been at no pains to investigate these rules, and has employed himself chiefly in detecting errors, most of which are supposed, because he takes for a finished work what Mr. Robins only gives to the public as a hasty but useful sketch of a new and very difficult branch of science.\n\nThe general result of Robins's experiments on the retardation of musket-shot is, that although in moderate velocities the resistance is so nearly in the duplicate proportion of the velocities that we cannot observe any deviation, yet in velocities exceeding 200 feet per second the retardations increase faster, and the deviation from this rate increases rapidly with the velocity. He attributes this to the causes already mentioned, viz. the condensation of the air before the ball and to the rarefaction behind, in consequence of the air not immediately occupying the space left by the bullet. This increase is so great, that if the resistance to a ball moving with the velocity of 1700 feet in a second be computed on the supposition that the resistance observed in moderate velocities is increased in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, it will be found hardly one-third part of its real quantity. He found, for instance, that a ball moving through 1670 feet in a second lost about 125 feet per second of its velocity in passing through 50 feet of air. This must have done in the 1/9 of a second, in which time it would have lost one foot if projected directly upwards; from which it appears that the resistance was about 125 times its weight, and more than three times greater than if it had increased from the resistance in small velocities in the duplicate ratio of the velocities. He relates other experiments which show similar results.\n\nBut he also mentions a singular circumstance, that till the velocities exceed 1100 feet per second, the resistances increase pretty regularly, in a ratio exceeding the duplicate ratio of the velocities; but that in greater velocities the resistances become suddenly triple of what they would have been, even according to this law of increase. He thinks this explicable by the vacuum which is then left behind the ball, it being well known that air rushes into a vacuum with the velocity of 1132 feet per second nearly. Mr. Euler controverts this conclusion, as inconsistent with that gradation which is observed in all the operations of nature; and says, that although the vacuum is not produced in smaller velocities than this, the air behind the ball must be so rare (the space being imperfectly filled), that the pressure on the anterior part of the ball must gradually approximate to that pressure which an absolute vacuum would produce; but this is like his other criticisms. Robins does nowhere assert that this sudden change of resistance happens in the transition of the velocity from 1132 feet to that of 1131 feet 11 inches or the like, but only that it is very sudden and very great. It may be strictly demonstrated, that such a change must happen in a narrow enough limit of velocities to justify the appellation of sudden: a similar fact may be observed in the motion of a solid through water. If it be gradually accelerated, the water will be found nearly to fill up its place, till the velocity arrives at a certain magnitude, corresponding to the immersion of the body in the water; and then the smallest augmentation of its motion immediately produces a void behind it, into which the water rushes in a violent manner and is dashed into froth. A gentleman, who has had many opportunities for such observations, affirms us, that when standing near the line of direction of a cannon discharging a ball with a large allotment of powder, so that the initial velocity certainly exceeded 1100 feet per second, he always observed a very sudden diminution of the noise which the bullet made during its passage. Although the ball was coming towards him, and therefore its noise, if equable, would be continually increasing, he observed that it was loudest at first. That this continued for a second or two, and suddenly diminished, changing to a sound which was not only weaker, but differed in kind, and gradually increased as the bullet approached him. He said, that the first noise was like the hissing of red-hot iron in water, and that the subsequent noise rather resembled a hazy whistling. Such a change of sound is a necessary consequence of the different agitation of the air in the two cases. We know also, that air rushing into a void, as when we break an exhausted bottle, makes a report like a musket.\n\nMr. Robins's assertion therefore has every argument for its truth that the nature of the thing will admit. But we are not left to this vague reasoning: his experiments show us this diminution of resistance. It clearly appears from them, that in a velocity of 1700 feet the resistance is more than three times the resistance determined by the theory which he supposes the common one. When the velocity was 1665 feet, the actual resistance was 1/4 of the theoretical; and when the velocity was 490 feet, the actual resistance was about 1/4 of the theoretical. That he assumed a theory of resistance which gave them all too small, is of no consequence in the present argument.\n\nMr. Robins, in summing up the results of his observations on this subject, gives a rule very easily remembered for computing the resistances to those very rapid computing motions. It has been already mentioned in the article and very Gunney, but we repeat it here, in order to accommodate it to the quantities which have been determined in tons, some degree by experiment.\n\nLet \\( AB \\) represent the velocity of 1700 feet per second, and \\( AC \\) any other velocity. Make \\( BD \\) to \\( AD \\) as the resistance given by the ordinary theory to the resistance actually observed in the velocity 1700: then will \\( CD \\) be to \\( AD \\) as the resistance assigned by the ordinary theory to the velocity \\( AC \\) is to that which really corresponds to it.\n\nTo accommodate this to experiment, recollect* that a *See Gunney sphere of the size of a 12 pound iron shot, moving 25 feet nearly, in a second, had a resistance of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of a pound. Augment &c. this in the ratio of \\( 2^{3} \\) to \\( 1700^{2} \\), and we obtain 210 nearly, for the theoretical resistance to this velocity; but by comparing its diameter of \\( 4\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches with \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), the diameter of the leaden ball, which had a resistance of at least 11 pounds with this velocity, we conclude that the 12 pound shot would have had a resistance of 396 pounds: therefore \\( BD : AD = 210 : 396 \\), and \\( AB : AD = 186 : 396 \\); and \\( AB \\) being 1700, \\( AD \\) will be 3613.\n\nLet \\( AD = a \\), \\( AC = x \\), and let \\( R \\) be the resistance to a 12 pound iron shot moving one foot per second, and \\( r \\) the resistance (in pounds) wanted for the velocity \\( x \\);\nwe have \\( r = \\frac{R}{a-x} \\). Mr Robins's experiments give\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{1}{13750}\n\\]\n\nvery neatly. This gives \\( Ra = 0.263235 \\), which is nearly one fourth. Thus our formula becomes\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{0.263235 x^2}{3613 - x}, \\quad \\text{or very nearly} \\quad \\frac{x^2}{4(3613-x)}\n\\]\n\nfalling short of the truth about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th part. The simplicity of the formula recommends it to our use, and when we increase its result \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), it is incomparably nearer to the true result of the theory as corrected by Mr Robins than we can hope that the theory is to the actual resistance.\n\nWe can easily see that Mr Robins's correction is only a fagacious approximation. If we suppose the velocity 3613 feet, a very possible thing, the resistance by this formula is infinite, which cannot be. We may even suppose that the resistance given by the formula is near the truth only in such velocities as do not greatly exceed 1700 feet per second. No military projectile exceeds 2200, and it is great folly to make it so great, because it is reduced to 1700 almost in an instant, by the enormous resistance.\n\nThe resistance to other balls will be made by taking them in the duplicate ratio of the diameters.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the first mathematicians of Europe have lately employed themselves in improving this theory of the motion of bodies in a resisting medium; but their difficulties are such as few artillerymen can understand. The problem can only be solved by approximation, and this by the quadrature of very complicated curves. They have not been able therefore to deduce from them any practical rules of easy application, and have been obliged to compute Borda's and tables suited to different cases. Of these performances, that of the Chevalier Borda, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1760, seems the best adapted to military readers, and the tables are undoubtedly of considerable use; but it is not too much to say, that the simple rules of Mr Robins are of as much service, and are more easily remembered: besides, it must be observed, that the nature of military service does not give room for the application of any very precise rule. The only advantage that we can derive from a perfect theory would be an improvement in the construction of pieces of ordnance, and a more judicious appropriation of certain velocities to certain purposes. The service of a gun or mortar must always be regulated by the eye.\n\nThere is another motion of which air and other elastic fluids are susceptible, viz. an internal vibration of their particles, or undulation, by which any extended portion of air is distributed into alternate parcels of condensed and rarefied air, which are continually changing their condition without changing their places. By this change the condensation which is produced in one part of the air is gradually transferred along the mass of air to the greatest distances in all directions. It is of importance to have some distinct conception of this motion. It is found to be by this means that distant bodies produce in us the sensation of sound. See Acoustics. Sir Isaac Newton treated this subject with his accustomed ingenuity, and has given us a theory of it in the end of the second book of his Principia. This theory has been objected to with respect to the conduct of the argument, and other explanations have been given by the most eminent mathematicians. Though they appear to differ from Newton's, their results are precisely the same; but, on a close examination, they differ no more than John Bernoulli's theorem of centripetal forces differs from Newton's, viz. the one being expressed by geometry and the other by literal analysis. The celebrated De la Grange reduces Newton's investigation to a tautological proposition or identical equation; but Mr Young of Trinity college, Dublin, has, by a different turn of expression, freed Newton's method from this objection. We shall not repeat it here, but refer our mathematical readers to the article Acoustics, as it is not our business at present to consider its connection with sound.\n\nBut since Newton published this theory of aerial undulations, and of their propagation along the air, and used to explain the theory has been so corrected and improved as to be received by the most accurate philosophers as a branch of natural philosophy susceptible of rigid demonstration, it has been freely referred to by many writers on other parts of natural science, who did not profess to be mathematicians, but made use of it for explaining phenomena in their own line on the authority of the mathematicians themselves. Learning from them that this vibration, and the quaquaverium propagation of the pulses, were the necessary properties of an elastic fluid, and that the rapidity of this propagation had a certain assignable proportion to the elasticity and density of the fluid, they freely made use of these conceptions, and have introduced elastic vibrating fluids into many facts, where others would suspect no such thing, and have attempted to explain by their means many arbitrary phenomena of nature. Others are everywhere introduced, endowed with great elasticity and tenacity. Vibrations and pulses are supposed in this ether, and these are offered as explanations. The doctrines of animal spirits and nervous fluids, and the whole mechanical system of Hartley, by which the operations of the soul are said to be explained, have their foundation in this theory of aerial undulations. If these fancied fluids, and their internal vibrations, really operate in the phenomena ascribed to them, any explanation that can be given of the phenomena from this principle must be nothing else than showing that the legitimate consequences of these undulations are similar to the phenomena; or, if we are no more able to see this last step than in the case of sound (which we know to be one consequence of the aerial undulations, although we cannot tell how), we must be able to point out, as in the case of sound, certain constant relations between the general laws of these undulations and the general laws of the phenomena. It is only in this way that we think ourselves entitled to say that the aerial undulations are causes, though not the only causes, of sound; and it is because there is no such relation, but, on the contrary, a total dissimilarity, to be observed between the laws of elastic undulations and the laws of the propagation of light, that we assert with confidence that etherial undulations are not the causes of vision.\n\nExplanations of this kind suppose, therefore, in the first place, that the philosopher who proposes them understands precisely the nature of these undulations; in the next place, that he makes his reader sensible of those circumstances of them which are concerned in the effect to be explained; and, in the third place, that he makes the reader understand how this circumstance of the vibrating fluid is connected with the phenomenon, either by showing it to be its mechanical cause, as\nUndulation as when the philosopher explains the refounding of a musical chord to a flute or pipe which gave the same tone; or by showing that this circumstance of the undulation always accompanies the phenomenon, as when the philosopher shows that 233 vibrations of air in a second, in whatever manner or by whatever cause they are produced always are followed by the sensation of the tone C in the middle of the harpsichord.\n\nBut here we must observe, that, with the exception of Euler's unsuccessful attempt to explain the optical phenomena by the undulations of ether, we have met with no explanation of natural phenomena, by means of elastic and vibrating fluids, where the author has so much as attempted any one of these three things, to indubitably requisite in a logical explanation. They have talked of vibrations without describing them, or giving the reader the least notion of what kind they are; and in no instance that we can recollect have they showed how such vibrations could have any influence in the phenomenon. Indeed, by not describing with precision the undulations, they were freed from the task of showing them to be mechanical causes of the phenomenon; and when any of them show any analogy between the general laws of elastic undulations and the general laws of the phenomenon, the analogy is so vague, indirect, or partial, that no person of common prudence would receive it as argument in any case in which he was much interested.\n\nWe think it our duty to remonstrate against this slovenly way of writing: we would even hold it up to reprobation. It has been chiefly on this faithless foundation that the blind vanity of men has raised that degrading system of opinions called Materialism, by which the affections and faculties of the soul of man have been resolved into vibrations and pulses of ether.\n\nWe also think it our duty to give some account of this motion of elastic fluids. It must be such an account as shall be understood by those who are not mathematicians, because those only are in danger of being misled by the improper application of them. Mathematical discussion is, however, unavoidable in a subject purely mathematical; but we shall introduce nothing that may not be easily understood or confused in it; and we trust that mathematical readers will excuse us for a mode of reasoning which appears to them lax and inelegant.\n\nThe first thing incumbent on us is to show how elastic fluids differ from the unelastic in the propagation of any agitation of their parts. When a long tube is filled with water, and any one part of it pushed out of its place, the whole is instantly moved like a solid mass. But this is not the case with air. If a door be suddenly shut, the window at the farther end of a long and close room will rattle; but some time will elapse between the shutting of the door and the motion of the window. If some light dust be lying on a braced drum, and another be violently beat at a little distance from it, an attentive observer will see the dust dance up from the parchment; but this will be at the instant he hears the sound of the stroke on the other drum, and a sensible time after the stroke. Many such familiar facts show that the agitation is gradually communicated along the air; and therefore that when one particle is agitated by any sensible motion, a finite time, however small, must elapse before the adjoining particle is agitated in the same manner. This would not be the case in water if water be perfectly incompressible. We think that this Undulation of Air may be made intelligible with very little trouble.\n\nLet A, B, C, D, &c., be a row of aerial particles, at such distances that their elasticity just balances the pressure of the atmosphere; and let us suppose (as is deducible from the observed density of air being proportional to the compressing force) that the elasticity of the particles, by which they keep each other at a distance, is as their distances inversely. Let us farther suppose that the particle A has been carried, with an uniform motion, to a by some external force. It is evident that B cannot remain in its present state; for being now nearer to a than to C, it is propelled towards C by the excess of the elasticity of A above the natural elasticity of C. Let E be the natural elasticity of the particles, or the force corresponding to the distance BC or BA, and let F be the force which impels B towards C, and let f be the force exerted by A when at a.\n\nWe have\n\n\\[ E : f = B a : B C, = B a : B A; \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ E : f = B a : B A - B a = B a : A a; \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ E : F = B a : A a. \\]\n\nNow in fig. 89, let ABC be the line joining three Fig. 89. particles, to which draw FG, PH parallel, and IAF, HBG perpendicular. Take IF or HG to represent the elasticity corresponding to the distance AB. Let the particle A be supposed to have been carried with an uniform motion to a by some external force, and draw RA'M perpendicular to RG, and make FI : RM = B a : BA. We shall then have FI : PM = B a : A a; and PM will represent the force with which the particle B is urged towards C. Suppose this construction to be made for every point of the line AB, and that a point M is thus determined for each of them, mathematicians know that all these points M lie in the curve of a hyperbola, of which IG and GH are the asymptotes. It is also known by the elements of mechanics, that since the motion of A along AB is uniform, A a or IP may be taken to represent the time of describing A a; and that the area IPM represents the whole velocity which B has acquired in its motion towards C when A has come to a, the force urging B being always as the portion PM of the ordinate.\n\nTake GX of any length in HG produced, and let GX represent the velocity which the uniform action of the natural elasticity IF could communicate to the particle B during the time that A would uniformly describe A.B. Make GX to GY as the rectangle IFGH to the hyperbolic space IFRM, and draw YS cutting MR produced in S, and draw FX cutting MR in T. It is known to the mathematicians that the point S is in a curve line FS called the logarithmic curve; of which the leading property is, that any line RS parallel to GX is to GX as the rectangle IFGH is to the hyperbolic space IFRM, and that FX touches the curve in F.\n\nThis being the case, it is plain, that because RT increases in the same proportion with FR, or with the rectangle IFRP, and RS increases in the proportion of the space IFRM, TS increases in the proportion of the space IPM. Therefore TS is proportional to the velocity...\nUndulation of B when A has reached \\( v \\), and RT is proportional to the velocity which the uniform action of the natural elasticity would communicate to B in the same time. Then since FT' is as the time, and TS is as the velocity, the area FTS will be as the space described by B (urged by the variable force PM); while A, urged by the external force, describes Aa; and the triangle FR'T will represent the space which the uniform action of the natural elasticity would cause B to describe in the same time.\n\nAnd thus it is plain that these three motions can be compared together: the uniform motion of the agitated particle A, the uniformly accelerated motion which the natural elasticity would communicate to B by its constant action, and the motion produced in B by the agitation of A. But this comparison, requiring the quadrature of the hyperbola and logarithmic curve, would lead us into most intricate and tedious computations. Of these we need only give the result, and make some other comparisons which are palpable.\n\nLet Aa be supposed indefinitely small in comparison of AB. The space described by A is therefore indefinitely small; but in this case we know that the ratio of the space FR'T to the rectangle IFRP is indefinitely small. There is therefore no comparison between the agitation of A by the external force, and the agitation which natural elasticity would produce on a single particle in the same time, the last being incomparably smaller than the first. And this space FR'T is incomparably greater than FTS; and therefore the space which B would describe by the uniform action of the natural elasticity is incomparably greater than what it would describe in consequence of the agitation of A.\n\nFrom this reasoning we see evidently that A must be sensibly moved, or a finite or measurable time must elapse before B acquires a measurable motion. In like manner B must move during a measurable time before C acquires a measurable motion, &c.; and therefore the agitation of A is communicated to the dilatant particles in gradual succession.\n\nBy a farther comparison of these spaces we learn the time in which each succeeding particle acquires the very agitation of A. If the particles B and C only are considered, and the motion of C neglected, it will be found that B has acquired the motion of A a little before it has described \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the space described by A; but if the motion of C be considered, the acceleration of B must be increased by the retreat of C, and B must describe a greater space in proportion to that described by A. By computation it appears, that when both B and C have acquired the velocity of A, B has described nearly \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of A's motion, and C more nearly \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). Extending this to D, we shall find that D has described still more nearly \\( \\frac{9}{10} \\) of A's motion. And from the nature of the computation it appears that this approximation goes on rapidly: therefore, supposing it accurate from the very first particle, it follows from the equable motion of A, that each succeeding particle moves through an equal space in acquiring the motion of A.\n\nThe conclusion which we must draw from all this is, that when the agitation of A has been fully communicated to a particle at a sensible distance, the intervening particles, all moving forward with a common velocity, are equally compressed as to length, except a very few of the first particles; and that this communication, or this propagation of the original agitation, goes on with an undulation of Air.\n\nThese computations need not be attended to by such as do not wish for an accurate knowledge of the precise agitation of each particle. It is enough for such readers to see clearly that time must escape between the agitation of A and that of a distant particle; and this is abundantly manifest from the incomparability (execute the term) of the nascent rectangle IFRP with the nascent triangle FR'T, and the incomparability of FR'T with FTS.\n\nWhat has now been shown of the communication of any sensible motion Aa must hold equally with respect to any change of this motion. Therefore if a tremendous motion of a body, such as a spring or bell, should agitate the adjoining particle A by pulling it forward in the direction AB, and then allowing it to come back again in the direction BA, an agitation similar to this will take place in all the particles of the row one after the other. Now if this body vibrate according to Newton's law of motion of a pendulum vibrating in a cycloid, the neighbouring particle of air will of necessity vibrate in the same manner; and then Newton's demonstration in art. Acoustics needs no apology. Its only deficiency was, that it seemed to prove that this would be the way in which every particle would of necessity vibrate; which is not true, for the successive parcels of air will be differently agitated according to the original agitation. Newton only wants to prove the uniform propagation of the agitations, and he selects that form which renders the proof easiest. He proves, in the most unexceptionable manner, that if the particles of a pulse of air are really moving like a cycloidal pendulum, the forces acting on each particle, in consequence of the compression and dilatation of the different parts of the pulse, are precisely such as are necessary for continuing this motion, and therefore no other forces are required. Then since each particle is in a certain part of its path, is moving in a certain direction, and with a certain velocity, and urged by a determined force, it must move in that very manner. The objection started by John Bernoulli against Newton's demonstration (in a single line) of the elliptical motion of a body urged by a force in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance from the focus, is precisely the same with the objection against Newton's demonstration of the progress of aerial undulations, and is equally futile.\n\nIt must, however, be observed, that Newton's demonstration proceeds on the supposition that the linear agitations of a particle are incomparably smaller than the extent of an undulation. This is not strictly the case in any instance, and in many it is far from being true. In a pretty strong twang of a harpsichord wire, the agitation of a particle may be near the 50th part of the extent of the undulation. This must disturb the regularity of the motion, and cause the agitations in the remote undulations to differ from those in the first pulse. In the explosion of a cannon, the breaking of an exhausted bottle, and many instances which may be given, the agitations are still greater. The commentators on Newton's Principia, Le Sueur and Jacquier, have shown, and Euler more clearly, that when the original agitations are very violent, the particles of air will acquire a subordinate vibration compounded with the regular cycloidal vibration, and the progress of the pulses will be somewhat...\nUndulation somewhat more rapid; but the intricacy of the calculus of Air is so great, that they have not been able to determine with any tolerable precision what the change of velocity will be.\n\nAll this, however, is fully confirmed by experiment on founds. The found of a cannon at 10 or 20 miles distance does not in the least resemble its sound when near. In this case it is a loud instantaneous crack, to which we can assign no musical pitch; at a distance, it is a grave sound, of which we can tell the note; and it begins softly, swells to its greatest loudness, and then dies away growingly. The same may be said of a clap of thunder, which we know to be a loud snap of still less duration. It is highly probable that the appreciable tones which those distant sounds afford are produced by the continuance of these subordinate vibrations which are added together and fortified in the successive pulses, though not perceptible in the first, in a way somewhat resembling the resonance of a musical chord. Newton's explanation gathers evidence therefore from this circumstance. And we must further observe, that all elastic bodies tremble or vibrate almost precisely as a pendulum swinging in a cycloid, unless their vibrations are uncommonly violent; in which case they are quickly reduced to a moderate quantity by the resistance of the air. The only very loud sounds which we can produce in this way are from great bells; and in these the utmost extent of the vibration is very small in comparison with the breadth of the pulse. The velocity of these sounds has not been compared with that of cannon, or perhaps it would be found less, and an objection against Newton's determination removed. He gives 969 feet per second, Experiment 1147.\n\nBut it is also very probable, that in the propagation through the air, the agitation gradually and rapidly approaches to this regular cycloidal form in the successive pulses, in the same way as we observe that whatever is the form of agitation in the middle of a smooth pond of water, the spreading circles are always of one gentle form without asperities. In like manner, into whatever form we throw a stretched cord by the twang which we give it, it almost immediately makes smooth undulations, keeping itself in the shape of an elongated trochoid. Of this last we can demonstrate the necessity, because the case is simple. In the wave, the investigation is next to impossible; but we see the fact. We may therefore presume it in air. And accordingly we know that any noise, however abrupt and jarring, near at hand, is smooth at a distance. Nothing is more rough and harsh than the scream of a heron; but at half a mile's distance it is soft. The ruffle of a drum is also smooth at a distance.\n\nFig. 90 shows the successive situations of the particles of a row. Each line of the figure shows the same particles marked with the same letters; the first particle \\(a\\) being supposed to be removed successively from its quiescent situation and back to it again. The mark \\(x\\) is put on that part of each line where the agitated particles are at their natural distances, and the air is of the natural density. The mark \\(y\\) is put where the air is most of all compressed, and where it is most of all dilated; the curve line drawn through the lowest line of the figure is intended to represent the density in every point, by drawing ordinates to it from the straight line; the ordinates below the line indicate a rarity, and those above the line a density, greater than common.\n\nIt appears that when \\(a\\) has come back to its natural situation, the part of greatest density is between the particles \\(i\\) and \\(k\\), and the greatest rarity between \\(c\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nWe have only to add, that the velocity of this propagation depends on the elasticity and density of the fluid. If these vary in the same proportion, that is, if the fluid has its elasticity proportional to its density, the velocity will remain the same. If the elasticity or density alone be changed, the velocity of the undulations will change in the direct subduplicate ratio of the elasticity and the inverse subduplicate ratio of the density; for should the elasticity be quadrupled, the quantity of motion produced by it in any given time will be quadrupled. This will be the case if the velocity be doubled; for there would then be double the number of particles doubly agitated. Should the density be quadrupled, the elasticity remaining the same, the quantity of motion must remain the same. This will be the case if the velocity be reduced to one half; for this will propagate half the agitation to half the distance, which will communicate it to twice the number of particles, and the quantity of motion will remain the same. The same may be said of other proportions, and therefore\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\sqrt{E}}{\\sqrt{D}}. \\]\n\nTherefore a change in the barometer will not affect the velocity of the undulations in air; but they will be accelerated by heat, which diminishes its density, or increases its elasticity. The velocity of the pulses in inflammable air must be at least thrice as great, because its density is but one-tenth of that of air when the elasticity of both are the same.\n\nLet us now attend a little to the propagation of aerial pulses as they really happen; for this hypothesis of a single row of particles is nowhere to be observed.\n\nSuppose a sphere \\(A\\), fig. 91, filled with condensed air, as they and that the vessel which contains it is suddenly annihilated. The air must expand to its natural dimensions, supposing BCD. But it cannot do this without pressing aside the surrounding air. We have seen that in any single row of particles this cannot be at once diffused to a distance, but must produce a condensation in the air adjoining; which will be gradually propagated to a distance. Therefore this sphere BCD of the common density will form round it a shell, bounded by EFG, of condensed air. Suppose that at this instant the inner air BCD becomes solid. The shell of condensed air can expand only outwards. Let it expand till it is of the common density, occupying the shell HIK. This expansion, in like manner, must produce a shell of condensed air without it; at this instant let HIK become solid. The surrounding shell of condensed air can expand only outward, condensing another shell without it. It is plain that this must go on continually, and the central agitation will be gradually propagated to a distance in all directions. But, in this process, it is not the same numerical particles that go to a distance. Those of the original sphere go no further than BCD, those of the next shall go no further than HIK, &c. Further, the expansion outwards of any particle will be more moderate as the diffusion advances; for the whole motion of\nUndulation each shell cannot exceed the original quantity of motion; and the number of particles in each successive shell increases as the surface, that is, as the square of the distance from the centre; therefore the agitation of the particles will decrease in the same ratio, or will be in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance from the centre. Each successive shell, therefore, contains the same quantity of motion, and the successive agitations of the particles of any row out from the centre will not be equal to the original agitation, as happens in the solitary row. But this does not affect the velocity of the propagation, because all agitations are propagated equally fast.\n\nWe supposed the air A to become solid as soon as it acquired the common density; but this was to facilitate the conception of the diffusion. It does not stop at this bulk; for while it was denser it had a tendency to expand. Therefore each particle has attained this distance with an accelerated motion. It will, therefore, continue this motion like a pendulum that has passed the perpendicular, till it is brought to rest by the air without it; and it is now rather than common air, and collapses again by the greater elasticity of the air without it. This outward air, therefore, in regaining its natural density, must expand both ways. It expands towards the centre, following the collapsing of the air within it; and it expands outwards, condensing the air beyond it. By expanding inwards, it will again condense the air within it; and this will again expand; a similar motion happens in all the outward shells; and thus there is propagated a succession of condensed and rarefied shells of air, which gradually swell to the greatest distance.\n\nIt may be demonstrated, that when the central air has for the second time acquired the natural density, it will be at rest, and be disturbed no more; and that this will happen to all the shells in succession. But the demonstration is much too intricate for this place; we must be contented with pointing out a fact perfectly analogous. When we drop a small pebble into water, we see it produce a series of circular waves, which go along the surface of smooth water to a great distance, becoming more and more gentle as they recede from the centre; and the middle, where the agitation was first produced, remains perfectly smooth, and this smoothness extends continually; that is, each wave when brought to a level remains at rest. Now these waves are produced and propagated by the depression and elevation made at the centre. The elevation tends to diffuse itself; and the force with which each particle of water is actuated is a force acting directly up and down, and is proportional to the elevation or depression of the particle. This hydrostatic pressure operates precisely in the same way as the condensation and rarefaction of the air; and the mathematical investigation of the propagation of the circular undulations on smooth water is similar in every step to that of the propagation of the spherical waves in still air. For this we appeal to Newton's Principia, or to Euler's Opuscula, where he gives a very beautiful investigation of the velocity of the aerial pulses; and to some memoirs of de la Grange in the collections of the academies of Berlin and Turin. These two last authors have made the investigation as simple as seems possible, and have freed it from every objection which can be stated against the geometrical one of their greater teacher Newton.\n\nHaving said this much on the similarity between the undulation waves on water and the aerial undulations, we shall have recourse to them, as affording us a very tenable object to represent many affections of the other which it would be extremely difficult to explain. We neither feel nor see the aerial undulations; and they behoved, therefore, to be described very abstractedly and imperfectly, for explaining those motion of the water from the centre. Throw a small bit of cork on the surface, and it will be observed to popple up and down without the least motion outwards. In like manner, the particles of air are only agitated a very little outwards and inwards; which motion is communicated to the particles beyond them, while they themselves come to rest, unless agitated afresh; and this agitation of the particles is inconceivably small. Even the explosion of a cannon at no great distance will but gently agitate a feather, giving it a fingle impulse outwards, and immediately after another inwards or towards the cannon. When a harpsichord wire is forcibly twanged at a few feet distance, the agitation of the air is next to insensible. It is not, however, nothing; and it differs from that in a watery wave by being really outwards and inwards. In consequence of this, when the condensed shell reaches an elastic body, it impels it slightly. If its elasticity be such as to make it acquire the opposite shape at the instant that the next agitation and condensed shell of air touches it, its agitation will be doubled, and a third agitation will increase it, and so on, till it acquire the agitation competent to that of the shell of air which reaches it, and it is thrown into sensible vibration, and gives a sound extremely faint indeed, because the agitation which it acquires is that corresponding to a shell of air considerably removed from the original string. Hence it happens that a musical chord, pipe, or bell, will cause another to resound, whose vibrations are synchronous with its own; or if the vibrations of the one coincides with every second, or third, or fourth, &c. of the other; just as we can put a very heavy pendulum into sensible motion by giving it a gentle puff with the breath at every vibration, or at every second, third, or fourth, &c. A drum struck in the neighbourhood of another drum will agitate it very sensibly; for here the stroke depresses a very considerable surface, and produces an agitation of a considerable mass of air: it will even agitate the surface of stagnant water. The explosion of a cannon will even break a neighbouring window. The shell of condensed air which comes against the glass has a great surface and a great agitation: the best security in this case is to throw up the sash; this admits the condensed air into the room, which acts on the inside of the window, balancing part of the external impulse.\n\nIt is demonstrated in every elementary treatise of natural philosophy, that when a wave on water meets any plane obstacle, it is reflected by it from a centre equally removed behind the obstacle; that waves radiating from the focus of a parabola are reflected in waves perpendicular to its axis; that waves radiating from the focus of an ellipse are made to converge to the other focus, &c. &c. All this may be affirmed of the aerial undulations; that when part of a wave gets through a hole in the obstacle, it becomes the centre of a new series of waves; that waves bend round the extremities of","sp":335,"ep":354},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Undulation of an obstacle: all this happens in the aerial undulations. And lately, that when the surface of water is thrown into regular undulations by one agitation, another agitation in another place will produce other regular waves, which will cross the former without disturbing them in the smallest degree. The same thing happens in air; and experiments may be made on water which will illustrate in the most perfect manner many other affections of the aerial pulses, which we should otherwise conceive very imperfectly. We would recommend to our curious readers to make some of these experiments in a large vessel of milk. Take a long and narrow plate of lead, which, when set on the bottom of the vessel will reach above the surface of the milk; bend this plate into a parabola, elliptical or other curve. Make the undulations by dropping milk on the focus from a small pipe, which will cause the agitations to succeed with rapidity, and then all that we have said will be most distinctly seen, and the experiment will be very amusing and instructive, especially to the musical reader.\n\nWe would now request all who make or read explanations of natural phenomena by means of vibrations of ethers, animal spirits, nervous fluids, &c., to fix their attention on the nature of the agitation in one of these undulations. Let him consider whether this can produce the phenomenon, acting as any matter must act, by impulse or by pressure. If he sees that it can produce the phenomenon, he will be able to point out the very motion it will produce, both in quantity and direction, in the same manner as Sir Isaac Newton has pointed out all the irregularities of the moon's motion produced by the disturbing force of the sun. If he cannot do this, he fails in giving the first evidence of a mechanical explanation by the action of an elastic vibrating fluid. Let him then try to point out some palpable connection between the general phenomena of elastic undulations and the phenomenon in question; this would show an accompaniment to have at least some probability. It is thus only we learn that the undulations of air produce sound; we cannot tell how they affect the mechanism of the ear; but we see that the phenomena of sound always accompany them, and that certain modifications of the one are regularly accompanied by certain modifications of the other. If we cannot do this neither, we have derived neither explanation nor illustration from the elastic fluid. And lately, let him remember that even if he should be able to show the competency of this fluid to the production of the phenomenon, the whole is still an hypothesis, because we do not know that such a fluid exists.\n\nWe will venture to say, that whoever will proceed in this prudent manner will soon see the futility of most of the explanations of this kind which have been given. They are unfit for any but consummate mathematicians; for they alone really understand the mechanism of aerial undulations, and even they speak of them with hesitation as a thing but imperfectly understood. But even the unlearned in this science can see the incompatibility of the hypotheses with many things which they are brought to explain. To take an instance of the conveyance of sensation along the nerves; an elastic fluid is supposed to occupy them, and the undulations of this fluid are thought to be propagated along the nerves. Let us just think a little how the undulations would be conveyed along the surface of a canal which was completely filled up with reeds and bulrushes, or let us make the experiment on such a canal: we may reflect assured that the undulations in the one case will resemble those in the other; and we may see that in the canal there will be no regular or sensible propagation of the waves.\n\nLet these observations have their influence, along with others which we have made on other occasions, to wean our readers from this fashionable propensity to introduce invisible fluids and unknown vibrations into our physical difficulties. They have done immense, and we fear irreparable, mischief in science; and there is but one phenomenon that has ever received any explanation by their means.\n\nThis may suffice for a loose and popular account of aerial undulations; and with it we conclude our account of the motion, impulse, and resistance of air.\n\nWe shall now explain a number of natural appearances, depending on its pressure and elasticity, appearances not sufficiently general, or too complicated for the purposes of argument, while we were employed in the investigation of these properties, but too important to be passed over in silence.\n\nIt is owing to the pressure of the atmosphere that two surfaces which accurately fit each other cohere with great force. This is a fact familiarly known to the glass-casters, polishers of marble, &c. A large lens or specimen, ground on its tool till it becomes very smooth, requires more than any man's strength to separate it directly from the tool. If the surface is only a square inch, it will require 15 pounds to separate them perpendicularly, though a very moderate force will make them slide along each other. But this cohesion is not observed unless the surfaces are wetted or smeared with oil or grease; otherwise the air gets between them, and they separate without any trouble. That this cohesion is owing to the atmospheric pressure, is evident from the case with which the plates may be separated in an exhausted receiver.\n\nTo the same cause we must ascribe the very strong adhesion of snails, periwinkles, limpets, and other animals to valve shells, to the rocks. The animal forms the rim of its shell, so as to fit the shape of the rock to which it intends to cling. It then fills its shell (if not already filled by its own body) with water. In this condition it is evident that we must act with a force equal to 15 pounds for every square inch of touching surface before we can detach it. This may be illustrated by filling a drinking glass to the brim with water; and having covered it with a piece of thin wet leather, whelm it on a table, and then try to pull it straight up; it will require a considerable force. But if we expose a nail adhering to a stone in the exhausted receiver, we shall see it drop off by its own weight. In the same manner do the remora, the polypus, the lamprey, and many other animals, adhere with such firmness. Boys frequently amuse themselves by pulling out large stones from the pavement by means of a circle of stiff wetted leather fastened to a string. It is owing to the same cause that the bivalve shell fishes keep themselves so firmly shut. We think the muscular force of an oyster prodigious, because it requires such force to open it; but if we grind off a bit of the convex shell, so as to make a hole in it, though without hurting the fish in the final...\nThe pressure of the air, operating in this way, contributes much to the cohesion of bodies, where we do not suspect its influence. The tenacity of our mortars and cements would frequently be ineffectual without this affluence.\n\nIt is owing to the pressure of the atmosphere that a cask will not run by the cock unless a hole be opened in some other part of the cask. If the cask is not quite full, some liquor indeed will run out, but it will stop as soon as the diminished elasticity of the air above the liquor is in equilibrium (together with the liquor) with the atmospheric pressure. In like manner, a teapot must have a small hole in its lid to ensure its pouring out the tea. If indeed the hole in the cask is of large dimensions, it will run without any other hole, because air will get in at the upper side of the hole while the liquor runs out by the lower part of it.\n\nOn the same principle depends the performance of an instrument used by the spirit dealers for taking out a sample of their spirits. It consists of a long thin plate tube AB (fig. 74.), open at top at A, and ending in a small hole at B. The end B is dipped into the spirits, which rises into the tube; then the thumb is clapped on the mouth A, and the whole is lifted out of the cask. The spirit remains in it till the thumb be taken off; it is then allowed to run into a glass for examination.\n\nIt seems principally owing to the pressure of the air that frosts immediately occasion a scantiness of water in our fountains and wells. This is erroneously accounted for, by supposing that the water freezes in the bowels of the earth. But this is a great mistake: the most intense frost of a Siberian winter would not freeze the ground two feet deep; but a very moderate frost will consolidate the whole surface of a country, and make it impervious to the air; especially if the frost has been preceded by rain, which has soaked the surface. When this happens, the water which was filtering through the ground is all arrested and kept suspended in its capillary tubes by the pressure of the air, in the very same manner as the spirits are kept suspended in the instrument just now described by the thumb's shutting the hole A. A thaw melts the superficial ice, and allows the water to run in the same manner as the spirits run when the thumb is removed.\n\nCommon air is necessary for supporting the lives of most animals. If a small animal, such as a mouse or bird, be put under the receiver of an air-pump, and the air be exhausted, the animal will quickly be thrown into convulsions and fall down dead; if the air be immediately readmitted, the animal will sometimes revive, especially if the rarefaction has been briskly made, and has not been very great. We do not know that any breathing animal can bear the air to be reduced to one-fourth of its ordinary density, nor even one-third; nor have we good evidence that an animal will ever recover if the rarefaction is pushed very far, although continued for a very short time.","sp":354,"ep":356},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Effects of Air's pressure.\n\nStand this perfectly. If the solution is not already saturated with fixed air, it will take it up as fast as it is produced, and thus will purify the air: a solution of caustic alkali therefore will have this effect till it is rendered quite mild.\n\nThese experiments have been repeated, and varied in many circumstances, in order to ascertain whether this fixed air was really emitted by the lungs, or whether the inspired air was in part changed into fixed air by its combination with some other substance. This is a question which comes properly in our way, and which the doctrines of pneumatics enable us to answer. If the fixed air be emitted in substance from the lungs, it does not appear how a renewal of the air into which it is emitted is necessary; for this does not hinder the subsequent emission; and the bulk of the air would be increased by breathing in it, viz. by the bulk of all the fixed air emitted; but, on the contrary, it is a little diminished. We must therefore adopt the other opinion; and the discoveries in modern chemistry enable us to give a pretty accurate account of the whole process. Fixed air is acknowledged to be a compound, of which one ingredient is found to constitute about three-eighths of the whole atmospheric fluid; we mean vital air or the oxygen of Lavoisier. When this is combined with phlogiston, according to the doctrine of Stahl, or with charcoal, according to Lavoisier, the result is fixed air or carbonic acid. The change therefore which breathing makes on the air is the solution of this matter by vital air; and the use of air in breathing is the carrying off this noxious principle in the way of solution. When therefore the air is already so far saturated as not to dissolve this substance as fast as it is secreted, or must be secreted in the lungs, the animal suffers the pain of suffocation, or is otherwise mortally affected. Suffocation is not the only consequence; for we can remain for a number of seconds without breathing, and then we begin to feel the true pain of suffocation; but those who have been instantaneously struck down by an inspiration of fixed air, and afterwards recovered to life, complained of no such pain, and seemed to have suffered chiefly by a nervous affection. It is said (but we will not vouch for the truth of it), that a person may safely take a full inspiration of fixed air, if the passages of the nose be shut; and that unless these nerves are stimulated by the fixed air, it is not instantaneously mortal. But these are questions out of our present line of inquiry. They are questions of physiology, and are treated of in other places of this work. See ANATOMY and PHYSIOLOGY; see also LUNGS and RESPIRATION. Our business is to explain in what manner the pressure and elasticity of the air, combined with the structure and mechanism of the body, operate in producing this necessary secretion and removal of the matter discharged from the lungs in the act of breathing.\n\nIt is well ascertained, that the secretion is made from the mass of blood during its passage through the lungs. The blood delivered into the lungs is of a dark blackish colour, and is there changed into a florid red. In the lungs it is exposed to the action of the air in a prodigiously extended surface: for the lungs consist of an incalculable number of small vessels or bladders, communicating with each other and with the windpipe. These vessels are everywhere in contact with minute blood-vessels. The blood does not in itself come into immediate contact with the air; and it would seem that it is only the thin serous part of it which is acted on by the air at the mouths of the vessels or pores, where it stands by capillary attraction. Dr Priestley found, that venous blood inclosed in thin bladders and other membranes was rendered florid by keeping the bladders in contact with abundance of pure vital air. We know also, that breath is moist or damp, and must have acquired this moisture in the lungs. It is immaterial whether this secretion of water or lymph (as the anatomists call it) be furnished by mere exudation through simple pores, or by a vascular and organic secretion; in either case, some ingredient of the blood comes in contact with air in the lungs, and there unites with it. This is farther confirmed, by observing, that all breathing animals are warmer than the surrounding medium, and that by every process in which fixed air is formed from vital air heat is produced. Hence this solution in air of something from the blood has been assigned by many as the source of animal heat. We touch on these things in a very transitory way in this place, only in order to prove that, for the support of animal life, there must be a very extensive application of air to the blood, and that this is made in the lungs.\n\nThe question before us in this place is, How is this brought about by the weight and elasticity of the air? This is done in two ways; by the action of the muscles of the ribs, and by the action of the diaphragm and other muscles of the abdomen. The thorax or chest is a great cavity, completely filled by the lungs. The sides of this cavity are formed by the ribs. These are crooked or arched, and each is moveable round its two ends, one of them being inserted into the vertebrae of the back, and the other into the sternum or breast-bone. The rib turns in a manner resembling the handle of a draver. The inspection of fig. 76. will illustrate this matter a little. Suppose the curves \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(b\\), \\(f\\), \\(e\\), \\(g\\), &c. to represent the ribs moveable round the extremities. Each succeeding rib is more bent than the one above it, and this curvature is both in the vertical and horizontal direction. Suppose each so broad as to project a little over its inferior like the tiles of a roof. It is evident, that if we take the lower one by its middle, and draw it out a little, moving it round the line \\(n\\), it will bring out the next \\(d\\), along with it. Also, because the distance of the middle point \\(o\\) from the axis of motion \\(n\\) is greater than the distance of \\(m\\) from the axis \\(d\\), and because \\(o\\) will therefore describe a portion of a larger circle than \\(m\\) does, the rib \\(n\\), will slide up a little under the rib \\(d\\), or the rib \\(d\\) will overlap \\(n\\) a little more than before; the distance \\(o\\) will therefore be diminished. The same must happen to all the superior ribs; but the change of distance will be less and less as we go upwards. Now, instead of this great breadth of the ribs overlapping each other, suppose each inferior rib connected with the one above it by threads or fibres susceptible of contraction at the will of man. The articulations \\(e\\), \\(a\\), of the first or upper rib with the spine and sternum are so broad and firm, that this rib can have little or no motion round the line \\(a\\); this rib therefore is as a fixture for the ends of all the contracting fibres; therefore, whenever the fibres which connect the second rib with the first rib contract, the second must rise a little, and also go outward, and will carry the lower rib.","sp":356,"ep":357},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"The effects of ribs along with it; the third rib will rise still farther by the contraction of the muscles which connect it with the second, and so on; and thus the whole ribs are raised and thrown outward (and a little forward, because the articulation of each with the spine is considerably higher than that with the sternum), and the capacity of the thorax is enlarged by the contraction of its muscular covering. The direction of the muscular fibres is very oblique to the direction of the circular motion which it produces; from which circumstance it follows, that a very minute contraction of the muscles produces all the motion which is necessary. This indeed is not great; the whole motion of the lowest ribs is less than an inch in the most violent inspiration, and the whole contraction of the muscles of the twelve ribs does not exceed the eighth part of an inch, even supposing the intercostal muscles at right angles to the ribs; and being oblique, the contraction is still less (see Borelli, Sabatier, Monro, &c.). It would seem, that the intensity of the contractive power of a muscular fibre is easily obtained, but that the space through which it can be exerted is very limited; for in most cases nature places the muscles in situations of great mechanical disadvantage in this respect, in order to procure other conveniences.\n\nBut this is not the whole effect of the contraction of the intercostal muscles; since the compound action of the two sets of muscles, which cross each other from rib to rib like the letter X, is nearly at right angles to the rib, but is oblique to its plane, it tends to push the ribs closer on their articulations, and thus to press out the two pillars on which they are articulated. Thus, supposing af (fig. 77.) to represent the section of one of the vertebrae of the spine, and cd a section of the sternum, and ab, ef, cd, two opposite ribs, with a lax thread be connecting them. If this thread be pulled upwards by the middle g till it is tight, it will tend to pull the points b and e nearer to each other, and to press the vertebra af and the sternum cd outwards. The spine being the chief pillar of the body, may be considered as immovable in the present instance. The sternum is sufficiently susceptible of motion for the present purpose. It remains almost fixed a-top at its articulation with the first rib, but it gradually yields below; and thus the capacity of the thorax is enlarged in this direction also. The whole enlargement of the diameters of the thorax during inspiration is very small, not exceeding the fiftieth part of an inch in ordinary cases. This is easily calculated. Its quiescent capacity is about two cubic feet, and we never draw in more than 15 inches. Two spheres, one of which holds 2 cubic feet and the other 2 feet and 15 inches, will not differ in diameter above the fiftieth part of an inch.\n\nThe other method of enlarging the capacity of the thorax is very different. It is separated from the abdomen by a strong muscular partition called the diaphragm, which is attached to firm parts all around. In its quiescent or relaxed state it is considerably convex upwards, that is, towards the thorax, rising up into its cavity like the bottom of an ordinary quart bottle, only not so regular in its shape. Many of its fibres tend from its middle to the circumference, where they are inserted into firm parts of the body. Now suppose these fibres to contract. This must draw down its middle, or make it flatter than before, and thus enlarge the capacity of the thorax.\n\nPhysiologists are not well agreed as to the share which each of these actions has in the operation of enlarging the thorax. Many refer all share of it to the intercostal muscles, and say that it is performed by the diaphragm alone. But the fact is, that the ribs are really observed to rise even while the person is asleep; and this cannot possibly be produced by the diaphragm, as these anatomists assert. Such an opinion shows either ignorance or neglect of the laws of pneumatics. If the capacity of the thorax were enlarged only by drawing down the diaphragm, the pressure of the air would compress the ribs, and make them descend. And the simple laws of mechanics make it as evident as any proposition in geometry, that the contraction of the intercostal muscles must produce an elevation of the ribs and enlargement of the thorax; and it is one of the most beautiful contrivances of nature. It depends much on the will of the animal what share each of these actions shall have. In general, the greatest part is done by the diaphragm; and any person can breathe in such a manner that his rib shall remain motionless; and, on the contrary, he can breathe almost entirely by raising his chest. In the first method of breathing, the belly rises during inspiration, because the contraction of the diaphragm compresses the upper part of the bowels, and therefore squeezes them outwards; so that an ignorant person would be apt to think that the breathing was performed by the belly, and that the belly is inflated with the air. The strait lacing of the women impedes the motion of the ribs, and changes the natural habit of breathing, or brings on an unnatural habit. When the mind is depressed, it is observed that the breathing is more performed by the muscles of the thorax; and a deep sigh is always made in this way.\n\nThese observations on the manner in which the capacity of the chest can be enlarged were necessary, before we can acquire a just notion of the way in which the mechanical properties of air operate in applying it to the mass of blood during its passage through the lungs. Suppose the thorax quite empty, and communicating with the external air by means of the trachea or windpipe, it would then resemble a pair of bellows. Raising the boards corresponds to the raising of the ribs; and we might imitate the action of the diaphragm by forcibly pulling outwards the folded leather which unites them. Thus their capacity is enlarged, and the air rushes in at the nozzle by its weight in the same manner as water would do. The thorax differs from bellows only in this respect, that it is filled by the lungs, which is a vast collection of little bladders, like the holes in a piece of fermented bread, all communicating with the trachea, and many of them with each other. When the chest is enlarged, the air rushes into them all in the same manner as into the single cavity of an empty thorax. It cannot be said with propriety that they are inflated: all that is done is the allowing the air to come in. At the same time, as their membranous covering must have some thickness, however small, and some elasticity, it is not unlikely that, when compressed by expiration, they tend a little to recover their former shape, and thus aid the voluntary action of the muscles. It is in this manner that a small bladder of caoutchouc swells","sp":357,"ep":358},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Effects of swells again after compression, and fills itself with air or water. But this cannot happen except in the most minute vehicles; those of sensible bulk have not elasticity enough for this purpose. The lungs of birds, however, have some very large bladders, which have a very considerable elasticity, and recover their shape and size with great force after compression, and thus fill themselves with air. The respiration of these animals is considerably different from that of land animals, and their muscles act chiefly in expiration. This will be explained by and by as a curious variety in the pneumatic instrument.\n\nThis account of the manner in which the lungs are filled with air does not seem agreeable to the notions we entertain of it. We seem to suck in the air; but although it be true that we act, and exert force, in order to get air into our lungs, it is not by our action, but by action, but external pressure, that it does come in. If we apply our mouth to the top of a bottle filled with water, we find that no draught, as we call it, of our chest will suck in any of the water; but if we suck in the very same manner at the end of a pipe immersed in water, it follows immediately. Our interest in the thing makes us connect in imagination our own action with the effect, without thinking on the many steps which may intervene in the train of natural operations; and we consider the action as the immediate cause of the air's reception into the lungs. It is as if we opened the door, and took in by the hand a person who was really pushed in by the crowd without. If an incision be made into the side of the thorax, so that the air can get in by that way, when the animal acts in the usual manner, the air will really come in by this hole, and fill the space between the lungs and the thorax; but no air is sucked into the lungs by this process, and the animal is as completely suffocated as if the windpipe were shut up. And, on the other hand, if a hole be made into the lungs without communicating with the thorax, the animal will breathe through this hole, though the windpipe be stopped. This is successfully performed in cases of patients whose trachea is shut up by accident or by inflammation; only it is necessary that this perforation be made into a part of the lungs where it may meet with some of the great pulmonary passages: for if made into some remote part of a lobe, the air cannot find its way into the rest of the lungs through such narrow passages, obstructed too by blood, &c.\n\nWe have now explained, on pneumatic principles, the process of inspiration. The expiration is chiefly performed by the natural tone of the parts. In the act of inspiration the ribs were raised and drawn outwards in opposition to the elasticity of the solids themselves; for although the ribs are articulated at their extremities, the articulations are by no means such as to give a free and easy motion like the joints of the limbs. This is particularly the case in the articulations with the sternum, which are by no means fitted for motion. It would seem that the motion really produced here is chiefly by the yielding of the cartilaginous parts and the bending of the rib; when therefore the muscles which produce this effect are allowed to relax, the ribs again collapse. Perhaps this is assisted a little by the action of the long muscles which come down across the ribs without being inserted into them. These may draw them together a little, as we compress a loose bundle by a string.\n\nIn like manner, when the diaphragm was drawn down, it compressed the abdomen in opposition to the elasticity of all the viscera contained in it, and to the elasticity and tone of the teguments and muscles which surround it. When therefore the diaphragm is relaxed, these parts push it up again into its natural situation, and in doing this expel the air from the lungs.\n\nIf this be a just account of the matter, expiration should be performed without any effort. This accordingly is the case. We feel that, after having made an ordinary easy inspiration, it requires the continuance of the effort to keep the thorax in this enlarged state, and that all that is necessary for expiration is to cease to act. No person feels any difficulty in emptying the lungs; but weak people often feel a difficulty of inspiration, and compare it to the feeling of a weight on their breast; and expiration is the last motion of the thorax in a dying person.\n\nBut nature has also given us a mechanism by which we can expire, namely, the abdominal muscles; and when we have finished an ordinary and easy expiration, we can still expel a considerable bulk of air (nearly half of the contents of the lungs) by contracting the abdominal muscles. These, by compressing the body, force up its moveable contents against the diaphragm, and cause it to rise further into the thorax, acting in the same manner as when we expel the feces per anum. When a person breathes out as much air as he can in this manner, he may observe that his ribs do not collapse during the whole operation.\n\nThere seems then to be a certain natural unconstrained state of the vessels of the lungs, and a certain quantity of air necessary for keeping them of this size. It is air necessary to keep the lungs in a natural state; were they more compressed, the vessels would be compressed by the adjoining size; were they more lax, the vessels would be more crooked, and by this means obstructed. The frequent inspirations gradually change this air by mixing fresh air with it, and, at every expiration carrying off some of it. In catarrhs and inflammations, especially when attended with suppuration, the small passages into the remote vessels are obstructed, and thus the renewal of air in them will be prevented. The painful feeling which this occasions causes us to expel the air with violence, fluttering the windpipe, till we have exerted strongly with the abdominal muscles, and made a strong compression on the lower part of the thorax. We then open the passage suddenly, and expel the air and obstructing matter by violent coughing.\n\nWe have said, that birds exhibit a curious variety in the process of breathing. The muscles of their breathing wings being so very great, required a very extensive in birds' inflation, and this is one use of the great breast-bone. Another use of it is, to form a firm partition to hinder the action of these muscles from compressing the thorax in the act of flying: therefore the form of their chest does not admit of alternate enlargement and contraction to that degree as in land animals. Moreover, the muscles of their abdomen are also very small; and it would seem that they are not sufficient for producing the compression on the bowels which is necessary for carrying...\ncarrying on the process of concoction and digestion. Instead of aiding the lungs, they receive help from them.\n\nIn an ostrich, the lungs consist of a fleshy part A, A (fig. 78.), composed of vesicles like those of land animals, and, like theirs, serving to expose the blood to the action of the air. Besides these, they have on each side four large bags B, C, D, E, each of which has an orifice G communicating with the trachea; but the second, C, has also an orifice H, by which it communicates with another bag F situated below the rest in the abdomen. Now, when the lungs are compressed by the action of the diaphragm, the air in C is partly expelled by the trachea through the orifice G, and partly driven through the orifice H into the bag F, which is then allowed to receive it; because the same action which compresses the lungs enlarges the abdomen. When the thorax is enlarged, the bag C is partly supplied with fresh air through the trachea, and partly from the bag F. As the lungs of other animals resemble a common bellows, the lungs of birds resemble the smith's bellows with a partition; and anatomists have discovered passages from this part of the lungs into their hollow bones and quills. We do not know all the uses of this contrivance; and only can observe, that this alternate action must assist the muscles of the abdomen in promoting the motion of the food along the alimentary canal, &c. We can distinctly observe in birds that their belly dilates when the chest collapses, and vice versa, contrary to what we see in the land animals. Another use of this double passage may be to produce a circulation of air in the lungs, by which a compensation is made for the smaller surface of action on the blood: for the number of small vesicles, of equal capacity with these large bags, gives a much more extensive surface.\n\nIf we try to raise mercury in a pipe by the action of the chest alone, we cannot raise it above two or three inches; and the attempt is both painful and hazardous. It is painful chiefly in the breast, and it provokes coughing. Probably the fluids ooze through the pores of the vesicles by the pressure of the surrounding parts.\n\nOn the other hand, we can by expiration support mercury about five or six inches high; but this also is very painful, and apt to produce extravasation of blood. This seems to be done entirely by the abdominal muscles.\n\nThe operation properly termed sucking is totally different from breathing, and resembles exceedingly the action of a common pump. Suppose a pipe held in the mouth, and its lower end immersed in water. We fill the mouth with the tongue, bringing it forward, and applying it closely to the teeth and to the palate; we then draw it back, or bend it downwards (behind) from the palate, thus leaving a void. The pressure of the air on the cheeks immediately depresses them, and applies them close to the gums and teeth; and its pressure on the water in the vessel causes it to rise through the pipe into the empty part of the mouth, which it quickly fills. We then push forward the tip of the tongue, below the water, to the teeth, and apply it to them all round, the water being above the tongue, which is kept much depressed. We then apply the tongue to the palate, beginning at the tip, and gradually going backwards in this application. By this means the water is gradually forced backward by an operation similar to that of the gullet in swallowing. This is done by contracting the gullet above and relaxing it below, just as we would empty a gut of its contents by drawing our closed hand along it. By this operation the mouth is again completely occupied by the tongue, and we are ready for repeating the operation. Thus the mouth and tongue resemble the barrel and piston of a pump; and the application of the tip of the tongue to the teeth performs the office of the valve at the bottom of the barrel, preventing the return of the water into the pipe. Although usual, it is not absolutely necessary, to withdraw the tip of the tongue, making a void before the tongue. Sucking may be performed by merely separating the tongue gradually from the palate, beginning at the root. If we withdraw the tip of the tongue a very minute quantity, the water gets in and flows back above the tongue.\n\nThe action of the tongue in this operation is very powerful; some persons can raise mercury 25 inches; but this strong exertion is very fatiguing, and the soft parts are prodigiously swelled by it. It causes the blood to ooze plentifully through the pores of the tongue, faucies, and palate, in the same manner as if a cupping-glass and syringe were applied to them; and, when the inside of the mouth is excoriated or tender, as is frequent with infants, even a very moderate exertion of this kind is accompanied with extravasation of blood. When children suck the nurse's breast, the milk follows their exertion by the pressure of the air on the breast; and a weak child, or one that withholds its exertions on account of pain from the above-mentioned cause, may be afflicted by a gentle pressure of the hand on the breast: the infant pupil of nature, without any knowledge of pneumatics, frequently helps itself by pressing its face to the yielding breast.\n\nIn the whole of this operation the breathing is performed through the nostrils; and it is a prodigious difference to an infant when this passage is obstructed by mucus. We beg to be forgiven for observing by the way, that this obstruction may be almost certainly removed for a little while, by rubbing the child's nose with any liquid of quick evaporation, or even with water.\n\nThe operation in drinking is not very different from that in sucking: we have indeed little occasion here to drinking, fuck, but we must do it a little. Dogs and some other animals cannot drink, but only lap the water into their mouths with their tongue, and then swallow it. The gallinaceous birds seem to drink very imperfectly; they seem merely to dip their head into the water up to the eyes till their mouth is filled with water, and then holding up the head, it gets into the gullet by its weight, and is then swallowed. The elephant drinks in a very complicated manner; he dips his trunk into the water, and fills it by making a void in his mouth: this he does in the contrary way to man. After having depressed his tongue, he begins the application of it to the palate at the root, and by extending the application forward, he expels the air by the mouth which came into it from the trunk. The process here is not very unlike that of the condensing syringe without a piston valve, described in No. 58., in which the external air (corresponding here to the air in the trunk) enters by the hole F in the side, and is expelled through the hole in the end of the barrel; by this operation the trunk is filled with water; then he lifts his trunk out of the water, and bringing it to his mouth, pours the contents into it, and swallows it. On considering this operation, it appears that, by\nEffects of the same process by which the air of the trunk is taken into the mouth, the water could also be taken in, to be afterwards swallowed; but we do not find, upon inquiry, that this is done by the elephant; we have always observed him to drink in the manner now described. In either way it is a double operation, and cannot be carried on any way but by alternately sucking and swallowing, and while one operation is going on the other is interrupted; whereas man can do both at the same time. Nature seems to delight in exhibiting to rational observers her inexhaustible variety of resource; for many insects, which drink with a trunk, drink without interruption: yet we do not call in question the truth of the aphorism, *Natura maxime simplex et semper fisci confusa*, nor doubt but that, if the whole of her purpose were seen, we should find that her process is the simplest possible; for Nature, or Nature's God, is wise above our wisest thoughts, and simplicity is certainly the choice of wisdom; but alas! it is generally but a small and the most obvious part of her purpose that we can observe or appreciate. We seldom see this simplicity of nature fitted to us, except by some system-maker, who has found a principle which somehow tallies with a considerable variety of phenomena, and then cries out, *Frustra fit per plura quod fieri poept per pauca*.\n\nThere is an operation similar to that of the elephant, known up which many find a great difficulty in acquiring, viz., keeping up a continued blast with a blow-pipe. We would advise our chemical reader to attend minutely to the gradual action of his tongue in sucking, and he will find it such as we have described. Let him attend particularly to the way in which the tip of the tongue performs the office of a valve, preventing the return of the water into the pipe: the same position of the tongue would hinder air from coming into the mouth. Next let him observe, that in swallowing what water he has now got lodged above his tongue, he continues the tip of the tongue applied to the teeth; now let him shut his mouth, keeping his lips firm together, the tip of the tongue at the teeth, and the whole tongue forcibly kept at a distance from the palate; bring up the tongue to the palate, and allow the tip to separate a little from the teeth, this will expel the air into the space between the fauces and cheeks, and will blow up the cheeks a little; then, acting with the tip of the tongue as a valve, hinder this air from getting back, and depressing the tongue again, more air (from the nostrils) will get into the mouth, which may be expelled into the face without the teeth as before, and the cheeks will be more inflated: continue this operation, and the lips will no longer be able to retain it, and it will ooze through as long as the operation is continued. When this has become familiar and easy, take the blow-pipe, and there will be no difficulty in maintaining a blast as uniform as a smith's bellows, breathing all the while through the nostrils. The only difficulty is the holding the pipe: this fatigues the lips; but it may be removed by giving the pipe a convenient shape, a pretty flat oval, and wrapping it round with leather or thread.\n\nAnother phenomenon depending on the principles already established, is the land and sea-breeze in the warm countries.\n\nWe have seen that air expands exceedingly by heat; therefore heated air being lighter than an equal bulk of cold air, must rise in it. If we lay a hot stone in the sunshine in a room, we shall observe the shadow of the stone surrounded with a fluttering shadow of different degrees of brightness, and that this flutter rises rapidly in a column above the stone. If we hold an extinguished candle near the stone, we shall see the smoke move towards the stone, and then ascend from it. Now, suppose an island receiving the first rays of the sun in a perfectly calm morning; the ground will soon be warmed, and will warm the contiguous air. If the island be mountainous, this effect will be more remarkable; because the inclined sides of the hills will receive the light more directly: the midland air will therefore be most warmed; the heated air will rise, and that in the middle will rise fastest; and thus a current of air upwards will begin, which must be supplied by air coming in from all sides, to be heated and to rise in its turn; and thus the morning sea-breeze is produced, and continues all day. This current will frequently be reversed during the night, by the air cooling and gliding down the sides of the hills, and we shall have the land-breeze.\n\nIt is owing to the same cause that we have a circulation of air in mines which have the mouths of their air shafts of unequal heights. The temperature under ground mines is pretty constant through the whole year, while that of the atmosphere is extremely variable. Now, suppose a mine having a long horizontal drift, communicating between two pits or shafts, and that one of these shafts terminates in a valley, while the other opens on the brow of a hill perhaps 100 feet higher. Let us further suppose it summer, and the air heated to 65\u00b0, while the temperature of the earth is but 45\u00b0; this tall will be also the temperature of the air in the shafts and the drift. Now, since air expands nearly 24 parts in 10,000 by one degree of heat, we shall have an odds of pressure at the bottom of the two shafts equal to nearly the 20th part of the weight of a column of air 100 feet high (100 feet being supposed the difference of the heights of the shafts). This will be about six ounces on every square foot of the section of the shaft. If this pressure could be continued, it would produce a prodigious current of air down the long shafts, along the drift, and up the short shaft. The weight of the air acting through 100 feet would communicate to it the velocity of 30 feet per second: divide this by $\\sqrt{25}$, that is, by 4.5, and we shall have 18 feet per second for the velocity; this is the velocity of what is called a brisk gale. This pressure would be continued, if the warm air which enters the long shaft were cooled and condensed as fast as it comes in; but this is not the case. It is however cooled and condensed, and a current is produced sufficient to make an abundant circulation of air along the whole passage; and care is taken to dispose the shafts and conduct the passages in such a manner that no part of the mine is out of the circle. When any new lateral drift is made, the renewal of air at its extremity becomes more imperfect as it advances; and when it is carried a certain length, the air stagnates and becomes suffocating, till either a communication can be made with the rest of the mine, or a shaft be made at the end of this drift.\n\nAs this current depends entirely on the difference of temperature between the air below and that above, it must cease when this difference ceases. Accordingly, in the spring and autumn, the miners complain much of stagnation; but in summer they never want a current from the deep pits to the shallow, nor in the winter.\nEffects of a current from the shallow pits to the deep ones. It frequently happens also, that in mineral countries the chemical changes which are going on in different parts of the earth make differences of temperature sufficient to produce a sensible current.\n\nIt is easy to see that the same cause must produce a current down our chimneys in summer. The chimney is colder than the summer air, and must therefore condense it, and it will come down and run out at the doors and windows.\n\nThis naturally leads us to consider a very important effect of the expansion and consequent ascent of air by heat, namely the drawing (as it is called) of chimneys. The air which has contributed to the burning of fuel must be intensely heated, and will rise in the atmosphere. This will also be the case with much of the surrounding air which has come very near the fire, although not in contact with it. If this heated air be made to rise in a pipe, it will be kept together, and therefore will not soon cool and collapse; thus we shall obtain a long column of light air, which will rise with a force so much the greater as the column is longer or more heated. Therefore the taller we make the chimney, or the hotter we make the fire, the more rapid will be the current, or the draught or suction, as it is injudiciously called, will be so much the greater. The ascensional force is the difference between the weight of the column of heated air in the funnel and a column of the surrounding atmosphere of equal height. We increase the draught, therefore, by increasing the perpendicular height of the chimney. Its length in a horizontal direction gives no increase, but, on the contrary, diminishes the draught by cooling the air before it gets into the effective part of the funnel. We increase the draught also by obliging all the air which enters the chimney to come very near the fuel; therefore a low mantle-piece will produce this effect; also filling up all the spaces on each side of the grate. When much air gets in above the fire, by having a lofty mantle-piece, the general mass of air in the chimney cannot be much heated. Hence it must happen that the greatest draught will be produced by bringing down the mantle-piece to the very fuel; but this converts a fire-place into a furnace, and by thus sending the whole air through the fuel, causes it to burn with great rapidity, producing a prodigious heat; and this producing an increase of ascensional force, the current becomes furiously rapid, and the heat and consumption of fuel immense. If the fire-place be a cube of a foot and a half, and the front closed by a door, so that all the air must enter through the bottom of the grate, a chimney of 15 or 20 feet high, and sufficiently wide to give passage to all the expanded air which can pass through the fire, will produce a current which will roar like thunder, and a heat sufficient to run the whole inside into a lump of glass.\n\nAll that is necessary, however, in a chamber fire-place, is a current sufficiently great for carrying up the smoke and vitiated air of the fuel. And as we want also the enlivening flutter and light of the fire, we give the chimney-piece both a much great height and width than what is merely necessary for carrying up the smoke, only wishing to have the current sufficiently determinate and steady for counteracting any occasional tendency which it may sometimes have to come into the room. By allowing a greater quantity of air to get into the chimney, heated only to a moderate degree, we produce a more rapid renewal of the air of the room; did we oblige it to come so much nearer the fire as to produce the same renewal of the air in consequence of a more rapid current, we should produce an inconvenient heat. But in this country, where pit-coal is in general so very cheap, we carry this indulgence to an extreme; or rather we have not studied how to get all the desired advantages with economy. A much smaller renewal of air than we commonly produce is abundantly wholesome and pleasant, and we may have all the pleasure of the light and flame of the fuel at much less expense, by contracting greatly the passage into the vent. The best way of doing this is by contracting the brick-work; on each side behind the mantle-piece, and reducing it to a narrow parallelogram, having the back of the vent for one of its long sides. Make an iron plate to fit this hole, of the same length, but broader, so that it may lie flopping, its lower edge being in contact with the foreside of the hole, and its upper edge leaning on the back of the vent. In this position it shuts the hole entirely. Now let the plate have a hinge along the front or lower edge, and fold up like the lid of a chest. We shall thus be able to enlarge the passage at pleasure. In a fire-place fit for a room of 24 feet by 18, if this plate may be about 18 inches long from side to side, and folded back within an inch or an inch and a half of the wall, this will allow passage for as much air as will keep up a very cheerful fire; and by raising or lowering this register, the fire may be made to burn more or less rapidly. A free passage of half an inch will be sufficient in weather that is not immoderately cold. The principle on which this construction produces its effect is, that the air which is in the front of the fire, and much warmed by it, is not allowed to get into the chimney, where it would be immediately hurried up the vent, but rises up to the ceiling and is diffused over the whole room. This double motion of the air may be distinctly observed by opening a little of the door and holding a candle in the way. If the candle be held near the floor, the flame will be blown into the room; but if held near the top of the door, the flame will be blown outward.\n\nBut the most perfect method of warming an apartment in the temperate climates, where we can indulge of a stove in the cheerfulness and sweet air produced by an open grate or fire, is what we call a stove-grate, and our neighbours on the continent call a chapelle, from its resemblance to the chapels or oratories in the great churches.\n\nIn the great chimney-piece, which, in this case, may be made even larger than ordinary, is let a smaller one fitted up in the same style of ornament, but of a size no greater than is sufficient for holding the fuel. The sides and back of it are made of iron (cast iron is preferable to hammered iron, because it does not readily calcine), and are kept at a small distance from the sides and back of the main chimney-piece, and are continued down to the hearth, so that the ash-pit is also separated. The pipe or chimney of the stove grate is carried up behind the ornaments of the mantle-piece till it rises above the mantle-piece of the main chimney-piece, and is fitted with a register or damper-plate turning round a traverse axis. The best form of this register is that which we have recommended for an ordinary fire-place, having its axis or joint close at the front; so that when it is open or turned up, the burnt air\nEffects of air and smoke striking it obliquely, are directed with certainty into the vent, without any risk of reverberating and coming out into the room. All the rest of the vent is shut up by iron plates or brick-work out of sight.\n\nThe effect of this construction is very obvious. The fuel, being in immediate contact with the back and sides of the grate, heats them to a great degree, and they heat the air contiguous to them. This heated air cannot get up the vent, because the passageways above these spaces are shut up. It therefore comes out into the room; some of it goes into the real fire-place and is carried up the vent, and the rest rises to the ceiling and is diffused over the room.\n\nIt is surprising to a person who does not consider it how skillfully this grate warms a room. Less than one-fourth of the fuel consumed in an ordinary fire-place is sufficient; and this with the same cheerful blazing hearth and salutary renewal of air. It even requires attention to keep the room cool enough. The heat communicated to those parts in contact with the fuel is needlessly great; and it will be a considerable improvement to line this part with very thick plates of cast iron, or with tiles made of fire-clay which will not crack with the heat. These, being very bad conductors, will make the heat, ultimately communicated to the air, very moderate. If, with all these precautions, the heat should be found too great, it may be brought under perfect management by opening passageways into the vent from the lateral spaces. These may be valves or trap-doors moved by rods concealed behind the ornaments.\n\nThus we have a fire-place under the most complete regulation, where we can always have a cheerful fire without being for a quarter of an hour incommodeed by the heat; and we can as quickly raise our fire, when too low, by hanging on a plate of iron on the front, which shall reach as low as the grate. This in five minutes will blow up the fire into a glow; and the plate may be sent out of the room, or let behind the stove-grate out of sight.\n\nThe propriety of inclosing the ash-pit is not so obvious; but if this be not done, the light ashes, not finding a ready passage up the chimney, will come out into the room along with the heated air.\n\nWe do not consider in this place the various extraneous circumstances which impede the current of air in our chimneys and produce smoky houses: these will be treated of, and the methods of removing or remedying them, under the article SMOKE. We consider at present only the theory of this motion in general, and the modifications of its operation arising from the various purposes to which it may be applied.\n\nUnder this head we shall next give a general account and description of the method of warming apartments by stoves. A STOVE in general is a fire-place shut up on all sides, having only a passage for admitting the air to support the fire, and a tube for carrying off the vitiated air and smoke; and the air of the room is warmed by coming into contact with the outside of the stove and flue. The general principle of construction, therefore, is very simple. The air must be made to come into close contact as possible with the fire, or even to pass through it, and this in such quantities as just to consume a quantity of fuel sufficient for producing the heat required; and the stove must be so constructed, that both the burning fuel and the air which has been heated by it shall be applied to as extensive a surface as possible of furnace, all in contact with the air of the room; and the heated air within the stove must not be allowed to get into the funnel which is to carry it off till it is too much cooled to produce any considerable heat on the outside of the stove.\n\nIn this temperate climate no great ingenuity is necessary for warming an ordinary apartment; and stoves are made rather to please the eye as furniture than as economical substitutes for an open fire of equal calorific power. But our neighbours on the continent, and especially towards the north, where the cold of winter is intense and fuel very dear, have bestowed much attention on their construction, and have combined ingenious economy with every elegance of form. Nothing can be handsomer than the stoves of Fayencerie that are to be seen in French Flanders, or the Ruffian stoves at St Petersburgh, finished in stucco. Our readers will not, therefore, be displeased with a description of them. In this place, however, we shall only consider a stove in general as a subject of pneumatical discussion, and we refer our readers to the article STOVE for an account of them as articles of domestic accommodation.\n\nThe general form, therefore, of a stove, and of which all others are only modifications adapted to circumstances of utility or taste, is as follows:\n\nMIKL (fig. 79.) is a quadrangular box of any size Fig. 79. in the directions MILK. The inside width from front to back is pretty constant, never less than ten inches, and rarely extending to twenty-three; the included space is divided by a great many partitions. The lowest chamber AB is the receptacle for the fuel, which lies on the bottom of the stove without any grate; this fire-place has a door AO turning on hinges, and in this door is a very small wicket P: the roof of the fire-place extends to within a very few inches of the farther end, leaving a narrow passage B for the flame. The next partition c C is about eight inches higher, and reaches almost to the other end, leaving a narrow passage for the flame at C. The partitions are repeated above, at the distance of eight inches, leaving passages at the ends, alternately disposed as in the figure; the last of them H communicates with the room vent. This communication may be regulated by a plate of iron, which can be slid across it by means of a rod or handle which comes through the side. The more usual way of shutting up this passage is by a sort of pan or bowl of earthenware, which is wedged over it with its brim resting in a pan contained in a groove formed all round the hole. This damper is introduced by a door in the front, which is then shut. The whole is set on low pillars, so that its bottom may be a few inches from the floor of the room: it is usually placed in a corner, and the apartments are so disposed that their chimneys can be joined in flacks as with us.\n\nSome straw or wood-shavings are first burnt on the hearth at its farther end. This warms the air in the stove, and creates a determined current. The fuel is then laid on the hearth close by the door, and pretty much piled up. It is now kindled; and the current being already directed to the vent, there is no danger of any smoke coming out into the room. Effectually to prevent this, the door is shut, and the wicket P opened.\nThe air supplied by this, being directed to the middle or bottom of the fuel, quickly kindles it, and the operation goes on.\n\nThe aim of this construction is very obvious. The flame and heated air are retained as long as possible within the body of the stove by means of the long passages; and the narrowness of these passages obliges the flame to come in contact with every particle of fuel, so as to consume it completely, and thus convert the whole combustible matter of the fuel into heat. For want of this a very considerable portion of our fuel is wasted by our open fires, even under the best management: the fuel which sticks to our vents is very inflammable, and a pound weight of it will give as much if not more heat than a pound of coal. And what sticks to our vents is very inconsiderable in comparison with what escapes unconsumed at the chimney top. In fires of green wood, peat, and some kinds of pit-coal, nearly one-fifth of the fuel is lost in this way; but in their stoves there is hardly ever any mark of fuel to be seen; and even this small quantity is produced only after lighting the fires. The volatile inflammable matters are expelled from parts much heated indeed, but not so hot as to burn; and some of it charred or half burnt cannot be any further consumed, being enveloped in flame and air already vitiated and unfit for combustion. But when the stove is well heated, and the current brisk, no part of the fuel escapes the action of the air.\n\nThe hot air retained in this manner in the body of the stove is applied to its sides in a very extended surface. To increase this still more, the stove is made narrower from front to back in its upper part; a certain breadth is necessary below, that there may be room for fuel. If this breadth were preserved all the way up, much heat would be lost, because the heat communicated to the partitions of the stove does no good. By diminishing their breadth, the proportion of useful surface is increased. The whole body of the stove may be considered as a long pipe folded up, and its effect would be the greatest possible if it really were so; that is, if each partition C, D, &c., were split into two, and a free passage allowed between them for the air of the room. Something like this will be observed afterwards in some German stoves.\n\nIt is with the same view of making an extensive application of a hot surface to the air, that the stove is not built in the wall, not even in contact with it, nor with the floor: for by its detached situation, the air in contact with the back, and with the bottom (where it is hottest), is warmed, and contributes at least one half of the whole effect; for the great heat of the bottom makes its effect on the air of the room at least equal to that of the two ends. Sometimes a stove makes part of the wall between two small rooms, and is found sufficient.\n\nIt must be remarked, on the whole, that the effect of a stove depends much on keeping in the room the air already heated by it. This is so remarkably the case, that a small open fire in the same room will be so far from increasing its heat, that it will greatly diminish it: it will even draw the warm air from a suite of adjoining apartments. This is distinctly observed in the houses of the English merchants in St Peterburgh: their habits of life in Britain make them uneasy without an open fire in their sitting rooms; and this obliges them to heat all their stoves twice a day, and their houses are cooler than those of the Russians who heat them only once. In many German houses, especially of the lower class, the fire-place of the stove does not open into the room, but into the yard or a lobby, where all the fires are lighted and tended; by this means is avoided the expense of warm air which must have been carried off by the stove: but it is evident, that this must be very unpleasant, and cannot be wholesome. We must breathe the same quantity of stagnant air loaded with all the vapours and exhalations which must be produced in every inhabited place. Going into one of these houses from the open air, is like putting one's head into a stew-pan or under a pie-crust, and quickly nauseates us who are accustomed to fresh air and cleanliness. In these countries it is a matter almost of necessity, to fumigate the rooms with frankincense and other gums burnt. The censer in ancient worship was in all probability an utensil introduced by necessity for sweetening or rendering tolerable the air of a crowded place: and it is a constant practice in the Russian houses for a servant to go round the room after dinner, waving a censer with some gums burning on bits of charcoal.\n\nThe account now given of stoves for heating rooms, of hot and of the circumstances which must be attended to in walls in their construction, will equally apply to hot walls in gardening, gardening, whether within or without doors. The only new circumstance which this employment of a flue introduces, is the attention which must be paid to the equability of the heat, and the gradation which must be observed in different parts of the building. The heat in the flue gradually diminishes as it recedes from the fire-place, because it is continually giving out heat to the flue. It must therefore be so conducted through the building by frequent returns, that in every part there may be a mixture of warmer and cooler branches of the flue, and the final chimney should be close by the fire-place. It would, however, be improper to run the flue from the end of the floor up to the ceiling, where the second horizontal pipe would be placed, and then return it downward again and make the third horizontal flue adjoining to the first, &c. This would make the middle of the wall the coldest. If it is the flue of a greenhouse, this would be highly improper, because the upper part of the wall can be very little employed; and in this case it is better to allow the flue to proceed gradually up the wall in its different returns, by which the lowest part would be the warmest, and the heated air will ascend among the pots and plants; but in a hot wall, where the trees are to receive heat by contact, some approximation to the above method may be useful.\n\nIn the hypocausts and fudaria of the Greeks and Romans, the flue was conducted chiefly under the floors.\n\nMalt-kilns are a species of stove which merit our attention. Many attempts have been made to improve malt kilns on the principle of flue stoves; but they have been unsuccessful, because heat is not what is chiefly wanted in malting: it is a copious current of very dry air to carry off the moisture. We must refer the examination of this subject also to the article STOVE, and proceed to consider the current of heated air in the chief varieties of furnaces.\n\nAll that is to be attended to in the different kinds of melting furnaces is, that the current of air be sufficiently rapid, and that it be applied in as extensive a surface as possible.\npossible to the substance to be melted. The more rapid the current it is the hotter, because it is consuming more fuel; and therefore its effect increases in a higher proportion than its rapidity. It is doubly effectual if twice as hot; and if it then be twice as rapid, there is twice the quantity of doubly hot air applied to the subject; it would therefore be four times more powerful.\n\nThis is procured by raising the chimney of the furnace to a greater height. The close application of it to the subject can hardly be laid down in general terms, because it depends on the precise circumstances of each case.\n\nIn reverberatory furnaces, such as refining furnaces for gold, silver, and copper, the flame is made to play over the surface of the melted metal. This is produced entirely by the form of the furnace, by making the arch of the furnace as low as the circumstances of the manipulation will allow. See Furnace. Experience has pointed out in general the chief circumstances of their construction, viz. that the fuel should be at one end on a grate, through which the air enters to maintain the fire; and that the metal should be placed on a level floor between the fuel and the tall chimney which produces the current. But there is no kind of furnace more variable in its effect, and almost every place has a small peculiarity of construction, on which its pre-eminence is relied. This has occasioned many whimsical varieties in their form. This uncertainty seems to depend much on a circumstance rather foreign to our present purpose; but as we do not observe it taken notice of by mineralogical writers, we beg leave to mention it here. It is not heat alone that is wanted in the refining of silver by lead, for instance. We must make a continual application to its surface of air, which has not contributed to the combustion of the fuel. Any quantity of the hottest air, already saturated with the fuel, may play on the surface of the metal for ever, and keep it in the state of most perfect fusion, but without refining it in the least. Now, in the ordinary construction of a furnace, this is much the case. If the whole air has come in by the grate, and passed through the middle of the fuel, it can hardly be otherwise than nearly saturated with it; and if air be also admitted by the door (which is generally done or something equivalent), the pure air lies above the vitiated air, and during the passage along the horizontal part of the furnace, and along the surface of the metal, it still keeps above it, at least there is nothing to promote their mixture. Thus the metal does not come into contact with air fit to act on the base metal and calcine it, and the operation of refining goes on slowly. Trifling circumstances in the form of the arch or canal may tend to promote the jumbling of the airs together, and thus render the operation more expeditious; and as these are but ill understood, or perhaps this circumstance not attended to, no wonder that we see these considered as so many novelties of great importance. It were therefore worth while to try the effect of changes in the form of the roof directed to this very circumstance. Perhaps some little prominence down from the arch of the reverberatory would have this effect, by suddenly throwing the current into confusion. If the additional length of passage do not cool the air too much, we should think that if there were interposed between the fuel and the refining floor a passage twisted like a cork-screw, making just half a turn, it would be most effectual: for we imagine, that the two airs, keeping each to their respective sides of the passage, would by this means be turned upside down, and that the pure stratum would now be in contact with the metal, and the vitiated air would be above it.\n\nThe glasshouse furnace exhibits the chief variety in the management of the current of heated air. In this glass-house it is necessary that the hole at which the workman dips his pipe into the pot shall be as hot as any part of the furnace. This could never be the case, if the furnace had a chimney situated in a part above the dipping-hole; for in this case cold air would immediately rush in at the hole, play over the surface of the pot, and go up the chimney. To prevent this the hole itself is made the chimney; but as this would be too short, and would produce very little current and very little heat, the whole furnace is set under a tall dome. Thus the heated air from the real furnace is confined in this dome, and constitutes a high column of very light air, which will therefore rise with great force up the dome, and escape at the top. The dome is therefore the chimney, and will produce a draught or current proportioned to its height. Some are raised above a hundred feet. When all the doors of this house are shut, and thus no supply given except through the fire, the current and heat become prodigious. This, however, cannot be done, because the workmen are in this chimney, and must have respirable air. But notwithstanding this supply by the house-doors, the draught of the real furnace is vastly increased by the dome, and a heat produced sufficient for the work, and which could not have been produced without the dome.\n\nThis has been applied with great ingenuity and effect to a furnace for melting iron from the ore, and an ironment of finery, both without a blast. The common blast iron Mr Cotterel's furnace is well known. It is a tall cone with the apex melting undermost. The ore and fluxes are thrown into this iron cone mixed intimately with the fuel till it is full, and the ore, the blast of most powerful bellows is directed into the bottom of this cone through a hole in the side. The air is thrown in with such force, that it makes its way through the mass of matter, kindles the fuel in its passage, and fluxes the materials, which then drop down into a receptacle below the blast-hole, and thus the passage for the air is kept unobstructed. It was thought impossible to produce or maintain this current without bellows; but Mr Cotterel, an ingenious founder, tried the effect of a tall dome placed over the mouth of the furnace, and though it was not half the height of many glasshouse domes it had the desired effect. Considerable difficulties, however, occurred; and he had not surmounted them all when he left the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, nor have we since heard that he has brought the invention to perfection. It is extremely difficult to place the holes below, at which the air is to enter, at such a precise height as neither to be choked by the melted matter, nor to leave ore and stones below them unmelted; but the invention is very ingenious, and will be of immense service if it can be perfected; for in many places iron ore is to be found where water cannot be had for working a blast furnace.\n\nThe last application which we shall make of the cur-","sp":358,"ep":365},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"We shall conclude this part of our subject with the explanation of a curious phenomenon observed in many places. Certain springs or fountains are observed to have periods of repletion and scantiness, or seem to ebb and flow at regular intervals; and some of these periods fact of the are of a complicated nature. Thus a well will have several returns of high and low water, the difference of which gradually increases to a maximum, and then diminishes, just as we observe in the ocean. A very ingenious and probable explanation of this has been given in No. 424. of the Philosophical Transactions, by Mr Attwell, as follows.\n\nLet ABCD (fig. 8o.) represent a cavern, into which Fig. 8o., water is brought by the subterranean passage OT. Let it have an outlet MNP, of a crooked form, with its highest part N considerably raised above the bottom of the cavern, and thence sloping downwards into lower ground, and terminating in an open well at P. Let the dimensions of this canal be such that it will discharge much more water than is supplied by TO. All this is very natural, and may be very common. The effect of this arrangement will be a remitting spring at P: for when the cavern is filled higher than the point N, the canal MNP will act as a typhon; and, by the conditions assumed, it will discharge the water faster than TO supplies it; it will therefore run it dry, and then the spring at P will cease to furnish water. After some time the cavern will again be filled up to the height N, and the flow at P will recommence.\n\nIf, besides this supply, the well P also receive water from a constant source, we shall have a reciprocating spring.\n\nThe situation and dimensions of this typhon canal, and the supply of the feeder, may be such, that the efflux at P will be constant. If the supply increase in a certain degree, a reciprocation will be produced at P with very short intervals; if the supply diminishes considerably, we shall have another kind of reciprocation with great intervals and great differences of water.\n\nIf the cavern have another simple outlet R, new varieties will be produced in the spring P, and R will afford a copious spring. Let the mouth of R, by which the water enters into it from the cavern, be lower than N, and let the supply of the feeding spring be no greater than R can discharge, we shall have a constant spring from R, and P will give no water. But suppose that the main feeder increases in winter or in rainy seasons, but not so much as will supply both P and R, the cavern will fill till the water gets over N, and R will be running all the while; but soon after P has begun to flow, and the water in the cavern sinks below R, the stream from R will stop. The cavern will be emptied by the typhon canal MNP, and then P will stop. The cavern will then begin to fill, and when near full R will give a little water, and soon after P will run and R stop as before, &c.\n\nDefaguliers shows, vol. ii. p. 177, &c. in what manner a prodigious variety of periodical ebbs and flows may be produced by underground canals, which are extremely simple and probable.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with the descriptions of some pneumatic machines or engines which have not been particularly noticed under their names in the former volumes of this work.\n\nBellows\nBellows are of most extensive and important use; and it will be of service to describe such as are of uncommon construction and great power, fit for the great operations in metallurgy.\n\nIt is not the impulsive force of the blast that is wanted in most cases, but merely the copious supply of air, to produce the rapid combination of inflammable matter; and the service would be better performed in general if this could be done with moderate velocities, and an extended surface. What are called air-furnaces, where a considerable surface of inflammable matter is acted on at once by the current which the mere heat of the expended air has produced, are found more operative in proportion to the air expended than blast furnaces animated by bellows; and we doubt not but that the method proposed by Mr Cotterel (which we have already mentioned) of increasing this current in a melting furnace by means of a dome, will in time supersede the blast furnaces. There is indeed a great impulsive force required in some cases; as for blowing off the scoria from the surface of silver or copper in refining furnaces, or for keeping a clear passage for the air in the great iron furnace.\n\nIn general, however, we cannot procure this abundant supply of air any other way than by giving it a great velocity by means of a great pressure, so that the general construction of bellows is pretty much the same in all kinds. The air is admitted into a very large cavity, and then expelled from it through a small hole.\n\nThe furnaces at the mines having been greatly enlarged; it was necessary to enlarge the bellows also; and the leather bellows becoming exceedingly expensive, wooden ones were substituted in Germany about the beginning of the 17th century, and from them became general throughout Europe. They consist of a wooden box ABCPFE (fig. 92.), which has its top and two sides flat or straight, and the end BAE formed into an arched or cylindrical surface, of which the line FP at the other end is the axis. This box is open below, and receives within it the shallow box KHGNML (fig. 93.), which exactly fills it. The line FP of the one coincides with FP of the other, and along this line is a set of hinges on which the upper box turns as it rises and sinks. The lower box is made fast to a frame fixed in the ground. A pipe OQ proceeds from the end of it, and terminates at the furnace, where it ends in a small pipe called the teeter or tuyere. This lower box is open above, and has in its bottom two large valves V, V, fig. 94., opening inwards. The conducting pipe is sometimes furnished with a valve opening outwards, to prevent burning coals from being sucked into the bellows when the upper box is drawn up. The joint along PF is made tight by thin leather nailed along it. The sides and ends of the fixed box are made to fit the sides and curved end of the upper box, so that this last can be raised and lowered round the joint FP without sensible friction, and yet without suffering much air to escape; but as this would not be sufficiently air tight by reason of the shrinking and warping of the wood, a farther contrivance is adopted. A slender lath of wood, divided into several joints, and covered on the outer edge with very soft leather, is laid along the upper edges of the sides and ends of the lower box. This lath is so broad, that when its inner edge is even with the inside of the box, its outer edge projects about an inch. It is kept in this position by a number of steel wires, which are driven into the bottom of the box, and stand up touching the sides, as represented in fig. 95., where a b c are the wires, and e the lath, projecting over the outside of the box. By this contrivance the laths are pressed close to the sides and curved end of the moveable box, and the spring wires yield to all their inequalities. A bar of wood RS (fig. 92.) is fixed to the upper board, by which it is either raised by machinery, to sink again by its own weight, having an additional load laid on it, or it is forced downward by a crank or wiper of the machinery, and afterwards raised.\n\nThe operation here is precisely similar to that of blowing with a chamber-bellows. When the board is lifted up, the air enters by the valves V, V, fig. 94., and is expelled at the pipe OQ by depressing the boards. There is therefore no occasion to infill on this point.\n\nThese bellows are made of a very great size, AD being 16 feet, AB five feet, and the circular end AE also five feet. The rise, however, is but about 3 or 3\u00bd feet. They expel at each stroke about 90 cubic feet of air, and they make about 8 strokes per minute.\n\nSuch are the bellows in general use on the continent. We have adopted a different form in this kingdom, which seems much preferable. We use an iron or wooden cylinder, with a piston sliding along it. This may be made with much greater accuracy than the wooden boxes, at less expense, if of wood, because it may be of cooper's work, held together by hoops; but the great advantage of this form is its being more easily made air-tight. The piston is surrounded with a broad strap of thick and felt leather, and it has around its edge a deep groove, in which is lodged a quantity of wool. This is called the packing or flanging, and keeps the leather very closely applied to the inner surface of the cylinder. Iron cylinders may be very neatly bored and smoothed, so that the piston, even when very tight, will slide along it very smoothly. To promote this, a quantity of black lead is ground very fine with water, and a little of this is smeared on the inside of the cylinder from time to time.\n\nThe cylinder has a large valve, or sometimes two, in the bottom, by which the atmospheric air enters when the piston is drawn up. When the piston is thrust down, this air is expelled along a pipe of great diameter, which terminates in the furnace with a small orifice.\n\nThis is the simplest form of bellows which can be conceived. It differs in nothing but size from the bellows used by the rudest nations. The Chinese smiths have a bellows very similar, being a square pipe of wood ABCDE (fig. 96.), with a square board G which exactly fits it, moved by the handle FG. At the farther end is the blast pipe HK, and on each side of it a valve in the end of the square pipe, opening inwards. The piston is sufficiently tight for their purposes without any leathering.\n\nThe piston of this cylinder bellows is moved by machinery. In some blast engines the piston is simply raised by the machine, and then let go, and it descends by its own weight, and compresses the air below it to such a degree, that the velocity of efflux becomes constant, and the piston descends uniformly; for this purpose it must be loaded with a proper weight. This produces a very uniform blast, except at the very beginning, while the piston falls suddenly and compresses the air; but in most engines the piston rod is forced down","sp":365,"ep":367},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Pneumatic the cylinder with a determined motion, by means of a beam, crank, or other contrivance. This gives a more unequal blast, because the motion of the piston is necessarily slow in the beginning and end of the stroke, and quicker in the middle.\n\nBut in all it is plain that the blast must be deftly. It ceases while the piston is rising; for this reason it is usual to have two cylinders, as it was formerly usual to have two bellows which worked alternately. Sometimes three or four are used, as at the Carron iron works. This makes a blast abundantly uniform.\n\nBut an uniform blast may be made with a single cylinder, by making it deliver its air into another cylinder, which has a piston exactly fitted to its bore, and loaded with a sufficient weight. The blowing cylinder ABCD (fig. 97.) has its piston P worked by a rod NP, connected by double chains with the arched head of the working beam NO, moving round a gudgeon at R. The other end O of this beam is connected by the rod OP, with the crank PQ of a wheel machine; or it may be connected with the piston of a steam engine, &c., &c. The blowing cylinder has a valve or valves E in its bottom, opening inwards. There proceeds from it a large pipe CF, which enters the regulating cylinder GHKI, and has a valve at top to prevent the air from getting back into the blowing cylinder. It is evident that the air forced into this cylinder must raise its piston L, and that it must afterwards descend, while the other piston is rising. It must descend uniformly, and make a perfectly equable blast.\n\nObserve, that if the piston L be at the bottom when the machine begins to work, it will be at the bottom at the end of every stroke, if the tuyere T emits as much air as the cylinder ABCD furnishes; nay, it will lie a while at the bottom, for, while it was rising, air was issuing through T. This would make an interrupted blast. To prevent this, the orifice T must be lessened; but then there will be a surplus of air at the end of each stroke, and the piston L will rise continually, and at last get to the top, and allow air to escape. It is just possible to adjust circumstances, so that neither shall happen. This is done easier by putting a stop in the way of the piston, and putting a valve on the piston, or on the conducting pipe KST, loaded with a weight a little superior to the intended elasticity of the air in the cylinder. Therefore, when the piston is prevented by the stop from rising, the shifting valve, as it is called, is forced open, the superfluous air escapes, and the blast preserves its uniformity.\n\nIt may be of use to give the dimensions of a machine of this kind, which has worked for some years at a very great furnace, and given satisfaction.\n\nThe diameter of the blowing cylinder is 5 feet, and the length of the stroke is 6. Its piston is loaded with 3\u00bd tons. It is worked by a steam-engine whose cylinder is 3 feet 4 inches wide, with a six feet stroke. The regulating cylinder is 8 feet wide, and its piston is loaded with 8\u00bd tons, making about 2.63 pounds on the square inch; and it is very nearly in equilibrium with the load on the piston of the blowing cylinder. The conducting pipe KST is 12 inches in diameter, and the orifice of the tuyere was \u00be of an inch when the engine was erected, but it has gradually enlarged by reason of the intense heat to which it is exposed. The shifting valve is loaded with 3 pounds on the square inch.\n\nWhen the engine worked briskly, it made 18 strokes per minute, and there was always much air discharged by the shifting valve. When the engine made 15 strokes per minute, the shifting valve opened but seldom, so that things were nearly adjusted to this supply. Each stroke of the blowing cylinder sent in 118 cubic feet of common air. The ordinary pressure of the air being supposed 14\u00bd pounds on an inch, the density of the air in the regulating cylinder must be \\(\\frac{14.75 + 2.63}{14.75} = 1.1783\\), the natural density being 1.\n\nThis machine gives an opportunity of comparing the expense of air with the theory. It must (at the rate of 15 strokes) expel 30 cubic feet of air in a second through a hole of 1\u00bd inches in diameter. This gives a velocity of near 2000 feet per second, and of more than 1600 feet for the condensed air. This is vastly greater than the theory can give, or is indeed possible; for air does not rush into a void with so great velocity. It shows with great evidence, that a vast quantity of air must escape round the two pistons. Their united circumferences amount to above 40 feet, and they move in a dry cylinder. It is impossible to prevent a very great loss. Accordingly, a candle held near the edge of the piston L has its flame very much disturbed. This case, therefore, gives no hold for a calculation; and it suggests the propriety of attempting to diminish this great waste.\n\nThis has been very ingeniously done (in part at least) at some other furnaces. At Omoah foundry, near Glasgow, the blowing cylinder (also worked by a steam engine) delivers its air into a chest without a bottom, which is immersed in a large cistern of water, and supported at a small height from the bottom of the cistern, and has a pipe from its top leading to the tuyere. The water stands about five feet above the lower brim of the regulating air-chest, and by its pressure gives the most perfect uniformity of blast, without allowing a particle of air to get off by any other passage besides the tuyere. This is a very effectual regulator, and must produce a great saving of power, because a smaller blowing cylinder will thus supply the blast. We must observe, that the loss round the piston of the blowing cylinder remains undiminished.\n\nA blowing machine was erected many years ago at Ch\u00e2tillon in France on a principle considerably different, and which must be perfectly air-tight throughout. Two cylinders A, B (fig. 98.), loaded with great weights, were suspended at the ends of the lever CD, moving round the gudgeon E. From the top F, G of each there was a large flexible pipe which united in H, from whence a pipe KT led to the tuyere T. There were valves at F and G opening outwards, or into the flexible pipes; and other valves L, M, adjoining to them in the top of each cylinder, opening inwards, but kept shut by a slight spring. Motion was given to the lever by a machine. The operation of this blowing machine is evident. When the cylinder A was pulled down, or allowed to descend, the water, entering at its bottom, compressed the air, and forced it along the passage FHKT. In the mean time, the cylinder B was rising, and the air entered by the valve M. We see that the blast will be very unequal, increasing as the cylinder is immersed deeper. It is needless to describe this machine more particularly, because we shall give","sp":367,"ep":368},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Fig. 95.\n\nABCD (fig. 99.) is an iron cylinder, truly bored within, and evacuated at top like a cup. EFGH is another, truly tuned both without and within, and a small matter less than the inner diameter of the first cylinder. This cylinder is close above, and hangs from the end of a lever moved by a machine. It is also loaded with weights at N. KILM is a third cylinder, whose outside diameter is somewhat less than the inside diameter of the second. This inner cylinder is fixed to the same bottom with the outer cylinder. The middle cylinder is loose, and can move up and down between the outer and inner cylinders without rubbing on either of them. The inner cylinder is perforated from top to bottom by three pipes OQ, SV, PR. The pipes OQ, PR have valves at their upper ends O, P, and communicate with the external air below. The pipe SV has a horizontal part VW, which again turns upwards, and has a valve at top X. This upright part WX is in the middle of a cistern of water f h k g. Into this cistern is fixed an air-chest a YZ b, open below, and having at top a pipe c d e terminating in the tuyere at the furnace.\n\nWhen the machine is at rest, the valves X, O, P, are shut by their own weights, and the air-chest is full of water. When things are in this state, the middle cylinder EFGH is drawn up by the machinery till its lower brims F and G are equal with the top RM of the inner cylinder. Now pour in water or oil between the outer and middle cylinders; it will run down and fill the space between the outer and inner cylinders. Let it come to the top of the inner cylinder.\n\nNow let the loaded middle cylinder descend. It cannot do this without compressing the air which is between its top and the top of the inner cylinder. This air being compressed will cause the water to descend between the inner and middle cylinders, and rise between the middle and outer cylinders, spreading into the cup; and as the middle cylinder advances downwards, the water will descend farther within it and rise farther without it. When it has got so far down, and the air has been so much compressed, that the difference between the surface of the water on the inside and outside of this cylinder is greater than the depth of water between X and the surface of the water f g, air will go out by the pipe SVW, and will lodge in the air-chest, and will remain there if c be shut, which we shall suppose for the present. Pushing down the middle cylinder till the partition touch the top of the inner cylinder, all the air which was formerly between them will be forced into the air-chest, and will drive out water from it. Draw up the middle cylinder, and the external air will open the valves O, P, and again fill the space between the middle and inner cylinders; for the valve X will shut, and prevent the regurgitation of the condensed air. By pushing down the middle cylinder a second time, more air will be forced into the air-chest, and it will at last escape by getting out between its brims Y, Z and the bottom of the cistern; or if we open the pat-\n\nfage c, it will pass along the conduit c d e to the tuyere, and form a blast.\n\nThe operation of this machine is similar to Mr Hafkin's quicksilver pump described by Delaguliers at the end of the second volume of his Experimental Philosophy. The force which condenses the air is the load on the middle cylinder. The use of the water between the inner and outer cylinders is to prevent this air from escaping; and the inner cylinder thus performs the office of a piston, having no friction. It is necessary that the length of the outer and middle cylinders be greater than the depth of the regulator-cistern, that there may be a sufficient height for the water to rise between the middle and outer cylinders, to balance the compressed air, and oblige it to go into the air-chest. A large blast-furnace will require the regulator-cistern five feet deep, and the cylinders about six or seven feet long.\n\nIt is in fact a pump without friction, and is perfectly air-tight. The quickness of its operation depends on the small space between the middle cylinder and the two others; and this is the only use of these two. Without these it would be similar to the engine at Chatham, and operate more unequally and slowly. Its only imperfection is, that if the cylinder begin its motion of ascent or descent rapidly, as it will do when worked by a steam-engine, there will be some danger of water dashing over the top of the inner cylinder and getting into the pipe SV; but should this happen, an illuse can easily be contrived for it at V, covered with a loaded valve v. This will never happen if the cylinder is moved by a crank.\n\nOne blowing cylinder only is represented here, but two may be used.\n\nWe do not hesitate in recommending this form of bellows as the most perfect of any, and fit for all uses where standing bellows are required. They will be cheaper than any other form for common purposes. For a common smith's forge they may be made with square wooden boxes instead of cylinders. They are also easily repaired. They are perfectly tight; and they may be made with a blast almost perfectly uniform, by making the cistern in which the air-chest stands of considerable dimensions. When this is the case, the height of water, which regulates the blast, will vary very little.\n\nThis may suffice for an account of blast machines. The leading parts of their construction have been described as far only as was necessary for understanding their operation, and enabling an engineer to erect them in the most commodious manner. Views of complete machines might have amused, but they would not have added to our reader's information.\n\nBut the account is imperfect unless we show how their parts may be so proportioned that they shall perform what is expected from them. The engineer should know what size of bellows, and what load on the board or piston, and what size of tuyere, will give the blast which the service requires, and what force must be employed to give them the necessary degree of motion. We shall accomplish these purposes by considering the efflux of the compressed air through the tuyere. The proportions formerly delivered will enable us to ascertain this.\n\nThat we may proportion every thing to the power employed,\nPneumatic employed, we must recollect, that if the piston of a cylinder employed for expelling air be pressed down with any force \\( P \\), it must be considered as superadded to the atmospheric pressure \\( P \\) on the same piston, in order that we may compare the velocity \\( v \\) of efflux with the known velocity \\( V \\) with which air rushes into a void. By what has been formerly delivered, it appears that this velocity\n\n\\[\nv = V \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{P + p}{P}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is the pressure of the atmosphere on the piston, and \\( p \\) the additional load laid on it.\n\nThis velocity is expressed in feet per second; and, when multiplied by the area of the orifice (also expressed in square feet), it will give us the cubical feet of condensed air expelled in a second; but the bellows are always to be filled again with common air, and therefore we want to know the quantity of common air which will be expelled; for it is this which determines the number of strokes which must be made in a minute, in order that the proper supply may be obtained. Therefore recollect that the quantity expelled from a given orifice with a given velocity, is in the proportion of the density \\( d \\); and that when \\( D \\) is the density of common air produced by the pressure \\( P \\), the density \\( d \\) produced by the pressure \\( P + p \\), is \\( D \\times \\frac{P + p}{P} \\); or if \\( D \\) be made 1, we have \\( d = \\frac{P + p}{P} \\).\n\nTherefore, calling the area of the orifice expressed in square feet \\( O \\), and the quantity of common air, or the cubic feet expelled in a second \\( Q \\), we have\n\n\\[\nQ = V \\times O \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{P + p}{P}} \\times \\frac{P + p}{P}\n\\]\n\nIt will be sufficiently exact for all practical purposes to suppose \\( P \\) to be 15 pounds on every square inch of the piston; and \\( p \\) is then conveniently expressed by the pounds of additional load on every square inch: we may also take \\( V = 1332 \\) feet.\n\nAs the orifice through which the air is expelled is generally very small, never exceeding three inches in diameter, it will be more convenient to express it in square inches; which being the \\( \\frac{1}{144} \\) of a square foot, we shall have the cubic feet of common air expelled in a second, or\n\n\\[\nQ = \\frac{1332}{144} \\times O \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{P + p}{P}} \\times \\frac{P + p}{P} = O \\times 9.25 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{P + p}{P}}\n\\]\n\nand this seems to be as simple an expression as we can obtain.\n\nThis will perhaps be illustrated by taking an example in numbers. Let the area of the piston be four square feet, and the area of the round hole through which the air is expelled be two inches, its diameter being 1.6, and let the load on the piston be 1728 pounds; this is three pounds on every square inch. We have \\( P = 15 \\), \\( p = 3 \\), \\( P + p = 18 \\), and \\( O = 2 \\); therefore we will have\n\n\\[\nQ = 2 \\times 9.25 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{15}} = 9.053 \\text{ cubic feet of common air expelled in a second.}\n\\]\n\nThis will however be diminished at least one-third by the contraction of the jet; and therefore the supply will not exceed six cubic feet per second. Supposing therefore that this blowing machine is a cylinder or prism of this dimension in its section, the piston so loaded would (after having compressed the air) descend about 1.5 inches in a second: It would first sink one-fifth of the whole length of the cylinder pretty suddenly, till it had reduced the air to the density \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and would then descend uniformly at the above rate, expelling six cubic feet of common air in a second.\n\nThe computation is made much in the same way for bellows of the common form, with this additional circumstance, that as the loaded board moves round a hinge at one end, the pressure of the load must be calculated accordingly. The computation, however, becomes a little intricate, when the form of the loaded board is not rectangular: it is almost useless when the bellows have flexible sides, either like smiths bellows or like organ bellows, because the change of figure during their motion makes continual variation on the compressing powers. It is therefore chiefly with respect to the great wooden bellows, of which the upper board slides down between the sides, that the above calculation is of service.\n\nThe propriety, however, of this piece of information is evident: we do not know precisely the quantity of air necessary for animating a furnace; but this calculation tells us what force must be employed for expelling the air that may be thought necessary. If we have fixed on the strength of the blast, and the diameter of the cylinder, we learn the weight with which the piston must be loaded; the length of the cylinder determines its capacity, the above calculation tells the expense per second; hence we have the time of the piston's coming to the bottom. This gives us the number of strokes per minute: the load must be lifted up by the machine this number of times, making the time of ascent precisely equal to that of descent; otherwise the machine will either catch and stop the descent of the piston, or allow it to lie inactive for a while of each stroke. These circumstances determine the labour to be performed by the machine, and it must be constructed accordingly. Thus the engineer will not be affronted by its failure, nor will he expend needless power and cost.\n\nIn machines which force the piston or bellows-board with a certain determined motion, different from what arises from their own weight, the computation is extremely intricate. When a piston moves by a crank, its motion at the beginning and end of each stroke is slow, and the compression and efflux is continually changing; we can however approximate to a statement of the force required.\n\nEvery time the piston is drawn up, a certain space of the cylinder is filled again with air of the common density; and this is expelled during the descent of the piston. A certain number of cubic feet of common air is therefore expelled with a velocity which perhaps continually varies; but there is a medium velocity with which it might have been uniformly expelled, and a pressure corresponding to this velocity. To find this, divide the area of the piston by the area of the blast-hole (or rather by this area multiplied by 0.613, in order to take in the effect of the contracted jet), and multiply the length of the stroke performed in a second by the quotient arising from this division; the product is the medium velocity of the air (of the natural density). Then find by calculation the height through which a heavy body must fall in order to acquire this velocity; this is the height of a column of homogeneous air which would expel\nPneumatic engines with this velocity. The weight of this column is the least force that can be exerted by the engine; but this force is too small to overcome the resistance in the middle of the stroke, and it is too great even for the end of the stroke, and much too great for the beginning of it. But if the machine is turned by a very heavy water-wheel, this will act as a regulator, accumulating itself the superfluous force during the too favourable positions of the crank, and exerting it by its vis in ita during the time of greatest effort. A force not greatly exceeding the weight of this column of air will therefore suffice. On the other hand, if the strength of the blast be determined, which is the general state of the problem, this determines the degree of condensation of the air, and the load on the square inch of the piston, or the mean force which the machine must exert on it. A table, which will be given presently, determines the cubic feet of common air expelled in a second, corresponding to this load. This combined with the proposed dimensions of the cylinder, will give the descent of the piston or the length of the stroke.\n\nThese general observations apply to all forms of bellows; and without a knowledge of them no person can erect a machine for working them without total uncertainty or servile imitation. In order, therefore, that they may be useful to such as are not accustomed to the management of even these simple formulae, we insert the following short table of the velocity and quantity of air discharged from a cylinder whose piston is loaded with the pounds contained in the first column on every square inch. The second column contains the velocity with which the condensed air rushes out through any small hole; and the third column is the cubic feet discharged from a hole whose area is a square inch; column fourth contains the mean velocity of air of the common density; and column fifth is the cubic feet of common air discharged; the sixth column is the height in inches at which the force of the blast would support a column of water if a pipe were inserted into the side of the cylinder. This is an extremely proper addition to such machines, showing at all times the power of the machines, and teaching us what intensity of blast is employed for different purposes. The table is computed from the supposition that the ordinary pressure of the air is 15 pounds on a square inch. This is somewhat too great, and therefore the velocities are a little too small; but the quantities discharged will be found about one-third too great (without affecting the velocities) on account of the convergency of the stream.\n\n| I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 239 | 1.66| 247 | 1.72| 14  |\n| 333 | 2.32| 353 | 2.47| 27  |\n| 404 | 2.79| 437 | 3.05| 40  |\n| 457 | 3.17| 518 | 3.60| 54  |\n| 500 | 3.48| 584 | 4.20| 68  |\n| 544 | 3.76| 653 | 4.53| 82  |\n| 582 | 4.03| 715 | 4.98| 95  |\n| 611 | 4.24| 774 | 5.38| 109 |\n| 642 | 4.46| 822 | 5.75| 122 |\n| 666 | 4.67| 888 | 6.17| 136 |\n| 693 | 4.84| 950 | 6.49| 150 |\n| 711 | 5.06| 997 | 6.92| 163 |\n\nThis table extends far beyond the limits of ordinary pneumatic use, very few blast-furnaces having a force exceeding 60 inches of water.\n\nWe shall conclude this account of blowing machines with a description of a small one for a blowpipe. ABCD, fig. 100, is a vessel containing water, about two feet deep. EFGH is the air-box of the blowers open below, and having a pipe HK rising up from it to a convenient height; an arm ON which grasps this pipe carries the lamp N; the blowpipe LM comes from the top of the upright pipe PKQ is the feeding pipe, reaching near to the bottom of the vessel.\n\nWater being poured into the vessel below, and its cover being put on, which fits the upright pipe, and touches two studs a, a, projecting from it, blow in a quantity of air by the feeding pipe PQ; this expels the water from the air-box, and occasions a pressure which produces the blast through the blowpipe M.\n\nIn No. 54. of this article, we mentioned an application which has been made of Hero's fountain, at Chemnitz in Hungary, for raising water from the bottom of a mine. We shall now give an account of this very ingenious contrivance.\n\nIn fig. 101. B represents the source of water elevated above the mouth of the pit 136 feet. From this there is led a pipe BB'CD four inches diameter. This pipe enters the top of a copper cylinder b c d e, 8\u00bd feet high, five feet diameter, and two inches thick, and it reaches to within four inches of the bottom; it has a cock at C. This cylinder has a cock at F, and a very large one at E. From the top b c proceeds a pipe GHH', two inches in diameter, which goes down the pit 96 feet, and is inserted into the top of another brass cylinder f g h i, which is 6\u00bd feet high, four feet diameter, and two inches thick, containing 83 cubic feet, which is very nearly one half of the capacity of the other, viz. of 170 cubic feet. There is another pipe NI of four inches diameter, which rises from within four inches of the bottom of this lower cylinder, is folded into its top, and rises to the trough NO, which carries off the water from the mouth of the pit. This lower cylinder communicates at the bottom with the water L which collects in the drains of the mine. A large cock K serves to admit or exclude this water; another cock M, at the top of this cylinder, communicates with the external air.\n\nNow suppose the cock C shut, and all the rest open; the upper cylinder will contain air, and the lower cylinder will be filled with water, because it is sunk so deep that its top is below the usual surface of the mine-waters. Now shut the cocks F, E, M, K, and open the cock C. The water of the source B must run in by the orifice D, and rise in the upper cylinder, compressing the air above it and along the pipe GHH', and thus acting on the surface of the water in the lower cylinder. It will therefore cause it to rise gradually in the pipe IN, where it will always be of such a height that its weight balances the elasticity of the compressed air. Suppose no issue given to the air from the upper cylinder, it would be compressed into one-fifth of its bulk by the column of 136 feet high; for a column of 34 feet nearly balances the ordinary elasticity of the air. Therefore, when there is an issue given to it through the pipe GHH', it will drive the compressed air along this pipe, and it will expel water from the lower cylinder.","sp":368,"ep":371},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"When the upper cylinder is full of water, there will be 34 cubic feet of water expelled from the lower cylinder. If the pipe IN had been more than 136 feet long, the water would have risen 136 feet, being then in equilibrium with the water in the feeding pipe BbCD (as was shown in No. 52), by the intervention of the elastic air; but no more water would have been expelled from the lower cylinder than what fills this pipe. But the pipe being only 96 feet high, the water will be thrown out at N with a very great velocity. If it were not for the great obstructions which water and air must meet with in their passage along pipes, it would issue at N with a velocity of more than 50 feet per second. It issues much more slowly, and at last the upper cylinder is full of water, and the water would enter the pipe GH and enter the lower cylinder, and without displacing the air in it, would rise through the discharging pipe IN, and run off to waste. To prevent this there hangs in the pipe HG a cork ball or double cone, by a bra's wire which is guided by holes in two crofs pieces in the pipe HG. When the upper cylinder is filled with water, this cork plugs up the orifice G, and no water is wasted; the influx at D now flows. But the lower cylinder contains compressed air, which would balance water in a discharging pipe 136 feet high, whereas IN is only 96. Therefore the water will continue to flow at N till the air has so far expanded as to balance only 96 feet of water, that is, till it occupies one fourth of its ordinary bulk, that is, one-fourth of the capacity of the upper cylinder, or 42\u00bd cubic feet. Therefore 42\u00bd cubic feet will be expelled, and the efflux at N will cease; and the lower cylinder is about one half full of water. When the attending workman observes this, he shuts the cock C. He might have done this before, had he known when the orifice G was stopped; but no loss ensues from the delay. At the same time the attendant opens the cock E, the water issues with great violence, being pressed by the condensed air from the lower cylinder. It therefore issues with the sum of its own weight and of this compression. These gradually decrease together, by the efflux of the water and the expansion of the air; but this efflux stops before all the water has flowed out; for there is 42\u00bd feet of the lower cylinder occupied by air. This quantity of water remains, therefore, in the upper cylinder nearly: the workman knows this, because the discharged water is received first of all into a vessel containing three-fourths of the capacity of the upper cylinder. Whenever this is filled, the attendant opens the cock K by a long rod which goes down the shaft; this allows the water of the mine to fill the lower cylinder, allows the air to get into the upper cylinder, and this allows the remaining water to run out of it.\n\nAnd thus every thing is brought into its first condition; and when the attendant sees no more water come out at E, he shuts the cocks E and M, and opens the cock C, and the operation is repeated.\n\nThere is a very surprising appearance in the working of this engine. When the efflux at N has stopped, if the cock F be opened, the water and air rush out together with prodigious violence, and the drops of water are changed into hail or lumps of ice. It is a sight usually shown to strangers, who are desired to hold their hats to receive the blast of air: the ice comes out with such violence as frequently to pierce the hat like a pistol bullet. This rapid congelation is a remarkable instance of the general fact, that air by suddenly expanding, generates cold, its capacity for heat being increased. Thus the peasant cools his broth by blowing over the spoon, even from warm lungs: a stream of air from a pipe is always cooling.\n\nThe above account of the procedure in working this engine shows that the efflux both at N and E becomes very slow near the end. It is found convenient therefore not to wait for the complete discharges, but to turn the cocks when about 30 cubic feet of water have been discharged at N: more work is done in this way. A gentleman of great accuracy and knowledge of these subjects took the trouble, at our desire, of noticing particularly the performance of the machine. He observed that each stroke, as it may be called, took up about three minutes and one-eighth; and that 32 cubic feet of water were discharged at N, and 66 were expended at E. The expense therefore is 66 feet of water falling 136 feet, and the performance is 32 raised 96, and they are in the proportion of 66\u00d7136 to 32\u00d796, or of 1 to 0.3422, or nearly as 3 to 1. This is superior to the performance of the most perfect undershot mill, even when all friction and irregular obstructions are neglected; and is not much inferior to any overshot pump-mill that has yet been erected. When we reflect on the great obstructions which water meets with in its passage through long pipes, we may be assured that, by doubling the size of the feeder and discharger, the performance of the machine will be greatly improved; we do not hesitate to say, that it would be increased one-third: it is true that it will expend more water; but this will not be nearly in the same proportion; for most of the deficiency of the machine arises from the needle's velocity of the first efflux at N. The discharging pipe ought to be 110 feet high, and not give sensibly less water.\n\nThen it must be considered how inferior in original expense this simple machine must be to a mill of any kind which would raise 10 cubic feet 96 feet high in a minute, and how small the repairs on it need be, when compared with a mill.\n\nAnd, lastly, let it be noticed, that such a machine can be used where no mill whatever can be put in motion. A small stream of water, which would not move any kind of wheel, will here raise one-third of its own quantity to the same height; working as fast as it is supplied.\n\nFor all these reasons, we think that the Hungarian machine eminently deserves the attention of mathematicians and engineers, to bring it to its utmost perfection, and into general use. There are situations where this kind of machine may be very useful. Thus, where the tide rises 17 feet, it may be used for compressing air to seven-eighths of its bulk; and a pipe leading from a very large vessel inverted in it, may be used for raising the water from a vessel of one-eighth of its capacity 17 feet high; or if this vessel has only \u00bc of the capacity of the large one set in the tide way, two pipes may be led from it, one into the small vessel and the other into an equal vessel 16 feet higher, which receives the water from the first. Thus one-sixteenth of the water may be raised 34 feet, and a smaller quantity to a still greater height; and this with a kind of power that can hardly be applied in any other way. Machines of this kind are described by Schottus, Sturmius, Leupold, and other old writers; and they should not be forgotten, because opportunities may","sp":371,"ep":372},{"h":"PNEUMATICS","t":"Pneumatic engines may offer of making them highly useful. A gentleman's house in the country may thus be supplied with water by a machine that will cost little, and hardly go out of repair.\n\nThe last pneumatic engine which we shall speak of at present is the common fanners, used for winnowing grain, and for drawing air out of a room; and we have but few observations to make on them.\n\nThe wings of the fanners are inclosed in a cylinder or drum, whose circular sides have a large opening BDE (fig. 102.) round the centre, to admit the air. By turning the wings rapidly round, the air is hurried round along with them, and thus acquires a centrifugal tendency, by which it presses strongly on the outer rim of the drum: this is gradually detached from the circle as at KI, and terminated in a trunk IHGF, which goes off in a tangential direction; the air therefore is driven along this passage.\n\nIf the wings were disposed in planes passing through the axis C, the compression of the air by the anterior surface would give it some tendency to escape in every direction, and would obstruct in some degree the arrival of more air through the side-holes. They are therefore reclined a little backward, as represented in the figure.\n\nIt may be shown that their best form would be that of a hyperbolic spiral \\(a b c\\); but the straight form approaches sufficiently near to the most perfect shape.\n\nMuch labour is lost, however, in carrying the air round those parts of the drum where it cannot escape. The fanners would either draw or discharge almost twice as much air if an opening were made all round one side. This could be gradually contracted (where required for winnowing) by a surrounding cone, and thus directed against the falling grain: this has been verified by actual trial. When used for drawing air out of a room for ventilation, it would be much better to remove the outer side of the drum entirely, and let the air fly freely off on all sides; but the flat sides are necessary, in order to prevent the air from arriving at the fanners any other way but through the central holes, to which trunks should be fitted leading to the apartment which is to be ventilated.\n\n---\n\nPNEUMATOSIS.

It was founded by one of those colonies from Greece which in the early ages established themselves in Italy; and it flourished before the foundation of Rome itself. It was destroyed by the Goths on the decline of the Roman empire, who in their barbarous zeal for the Christian religion overturned every place of Pagan worship which was exposed to their ravages. Since that time it has been in ruins; and these ruins were unknown till they were discovered in the following manner: \"In the year 1735 (says the author of the Antiquities, History, and Views of Positum), an apprentice to a painter at Naples, who was on a visit to his friends at Capaccio, by accident took a walk to the mountains which surround the territory of Positum. The only habitation he perceived was the cottage of a farmer, who cultivated the best part of the ground, and reserved the rest for pasture. The ruins of the ancient city made a part of this view, and particularly struck the eyes of the young painter; who, approaching nearer, saw with astonishment walls, towers, gates and temples. Upon his return to Capaccio, he consulted the neighbouring people about the origin of these monuments of antiquity. He could only learn, that this part of the country had been uncultivated and abandoned during their memory; that about ten years before, the farmer, whose habitation he had noticed, established himself there; and that having dug in many places and searched among the ruins that lay round him, he had found treasures sufficient to enable him to purchase the whole. At the painter's return to Naples, he informed his master of these particulars, whose curiosity was so greatly excited by the description, that he took a journey to the place, and made drawings of the principal views. These were shown to the king of Naples, who ordered the ruins to be cleared, and Positum arose from the obscurity in which it had remained for upwards of 700 years, as little known to the neighbouring inhabitants as to travellers.\"\n\nOur author gives the following description of it in its present state. It is, says he, of an oblong figure, about two miles and a half in circumference. It has four gates, which are opposite to each other. On the key stone of the arch of the north gate, on the outside, is the figure of Neptune in bas-relief, and within a hippocampus. The walls which still remain are composed of very large cubical stones, and are extremely thick, in some parts 18 feet. That the walls have remained unto this time is owing to the very exact manner in which the stones are fitted to one another (a circumstance observed universally in the masonry of the ancients), and perhaps in some measure to a stalactite concretion which has grown over them. On the walls here and there are placed towers of different heights; those near the gates being much higher and larger than the others, and evidently of modern workmanship. He observes, that, from its situation among marshes, bituminous and sulphurous springs, Positum must have been unwholesome; a circumstance mentioned by Strabo, Morbofam eam facit fluvius in paludes diffusus. In such a situation the water must have been bad. Hence the inhabitants were obliged to convey that necessity of life from purer springs by means of aqueducts, of which many vestiges still remain.\n\nThe principal monuments of antiquity are a theatre, an amphitheatre, and three temples. The theatre and amphitheatre are much ruined. The first temple is hexastylos,","sp":396,"ep":396},{"h":"POETRY","t":"A MIDST those thick clouds which envelope the first ages of the world, reason and history throw some lights on the origin and primitive employment of this divine art. Reason suggests, that before the invention of letters, all the people of the earth had no other method of transmitting to their descendants the principles of their worship, their religious ceremonies, their laws, and the renowned actions of their sages and heroes, than by poetry; which included all these objects in a kind of hymns that fathers sung to their children, in order to engrave them with indelible strokes in their hearts. History not only informs us, that Moses and Miriam, the first authors that are known to mankind, sung, on the borders of the Red sea, a song of divine praise, to celebrate the deliverance which the Almighty had vouchsafed to the people of Israel, by opening a passage to them through the waters; but it has also transmitted to us the song itself, which is at once the most ancient monument and a masterpiece of poetic composition.\n\nThe Greeks, a people the most ingenious, the most animated, and in every sense the most accomplished, that the world ever produced\u2014strove to rival from the Hebrews the precious gift of poetry, which was vouchsafed them by the Supreme Author of all nature, that they might ascribe it to their false deities. According to their ingenious fictions, Apollo became the god of poetry, and dwelt on the hills of Phocis, Parnassus, and Helicon, whose feet were washed by the waters of Hippocrene, of which each mortal that ever drank was seized with a sacred delirium. The immortal swans floated on its waves. Apollo was accompanied by the Muses\u2014those nine learned sisters\u2014the daughters of Memory: and he was constantly attended by the Graces. Pegasus, his winged courier, transported him with a rapid flight into all the regions of the universe. Happy emblems! by which we at this day embellish our poetry, as no one has ever yet been able to invent more brilliant images.\n\nThe literary annals of all nations afford vestiges of poetry from the remotest ages. They are found among the most savage of the ancient barbarians, and the most desolate of all the Americans. Nature asserts her rights in every country and every age. Tacitus mentions the verses and the hymns of the Germans, at the time when that rough people yet inhabited the woods, and while their manners were still savage. The first inhabitants of Russia and the other northern countries, those of Gaul, Albion, Iberia, Aquitania, and other nations of Europe, had their poetry, as well as the ancient people of Asia, and of the known borders of Africa. But the simple productions of nature have constantly something unformed, rough, and savage. The Divine Wisdom appears to have placed the ingenious and polished part of mankind on the earth, in order to refine that which comes from her bosom rude and imperfect: and thus art has polished poetry, which issued quite naked and savage from the brains of the first of mankind.\n\nBut what is Poetry? It would be to abridge the definition limits of the poetic empire, to contract the sphere of poetry. This divine art, should we say, in imitation of all the dictionaries and other treatises on verification, that poetry is the art of making verses, of lines or periods that are in rhyme or metre. This is rather a grammatical explanation of the word, than a real definition of the thing, and it would be to degrade poetry thus to define it. The father of criticism has denominated poetry \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, an imitative art: but this, though just in itself, is too general for a definition, as it does not discriminate poetry from other arts which depend equally on imitation. The justest definition seems to be that given by Baron Bielfeld *, That poetry is the *Elem. of art of expressing our thoughts by fiction. In fact, it is an art. Under this manner (if we reflect with attention) that all the metaphors and allegories, all the various kinds of fiction, form the first materials of a poetic edifice: it is thus that all images, all comparisons, allusions, and figures, especially those which personify moral subjects, as virtues and vices, concur to the decoration of such a structure.\nA work, therefore, that is filled with invention, that incessantly presents images which render the reader attentive and affected, where the author gives interlacing sentiments to every thing that he makes speak, and where he makes speak by sensible figures all those objects which would affect the mind but weakly when clothed in a simple prosaic style, such a work is a poem. While that, though it be in verse, which is of a didactic, dogmatic, or moral nature, and where the objects are presented in a manner quite simple, without fiction, without images or ornaments, cannot be called poetry, but merely a work in verse; for the art of reducing thoughts, maxims, and periods, into rhyme or metre, is very different from the art of poetry.\n\nAn ingenious fable, a lively and interesting romance, a comedy, the sublime narrative of the actions of a hero, such as the Telemachus of M. Fenelon, though written in prose, but in measured prose, is therefore a work of poetry: because the foundation and the superstructure are the productions of genius, as the whole proceeds from fiction; and truth itself appears to have employed an innocent and agreeable deception to instruct with efficacy. This is so true, that the pencil also, in order to please and affect, has recourse to fiction; and this part of painting is called the *poetic composition of a picture*. It is therefore by the aid of fiction that poetry, so to speak, paints its expressions, that it gives a body and a mind to its thoughts, that it animates and exalts that which would otherwise have remained arid and insensible. It is the peculiar privilege of poetry to exalt inanimate things into animals, and abstract ideas into persons. The former licence is so common, that it is now considered as nothing more than a characteristic dialect appropriated by the poets to distinguish themselves from the writers of prose; and it is at the same time so essential, that we question much if this species of composition could subsist without it: for it will perhaps, upon examination, be found, that in every poetical description some of the qualities of Animal Nature are ascribed to things not having life. Every work, therefore, where the thoughts are expressed by fictions or images, is poetical; and every work where they are expressed naturally, simply, and without ornament, although it be in verse, is prose.\n\nVerse, however, is not to be regarded as foreign or superfluous to poetry. To reduce those images, those fictions, into verse, is one of the greatest difficulties in poetry, and one of the greatest merits in a poem: and for these reasons, the cadence, the harmony of sounds, particularly that of rhyme, delight the ear to a high degree, and the mind infensibly repeats them while the eye reads them. There results therefore a pleasure to the mind, and a strong attachment to these ornaments; but this pleasure would be frivolous, and even childish, if it were not attended by a real utility. Verses were invented in the first ages of the world, merely to aid and to strengthen the memory: for cadence, harmony, effectual and especially rhyme, afford the greatest affluence to poetry, one of the memory that art can invent; and the images, or of its excellent fictions, that strike our senses, affix in graving them with such deep traces in our minds, as even time itself frequently cannot efface. How many excellent apophthegms, sentences, maxims, and precepts, would have been buried in the abyss of oblivion, if poetry had not preserved them by its harmony? To give more efficacy to this lively impression, the first poets sung their verses, and the words and phrases must necessarily have been reduced, at least to cadence, or they could not have been susceptible of musical expression. One of the great excellencies, therefore, though not a necessary constituent of poetry, consists in its being expressed in verse. See Part III.\n\n**Part I. General Principles of the Art.**\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Essence and End of Poetry.**\n\nThe essence of Polite Arts in general, and consequently of poetry in particular, consists in expression; and we think that, to be poetical, the expression must necessarily arise from fiction, or invention. (See the article Art, particularly from No. 12. to the end.) This invention, which is the fruit of happy genius alone, arises:\n\n1. From the subject itself of which we undertake to treat;\n2. From the manner in which we treat that subject, or the species of writing of which we make use;\n3. From the plan that we propose to follow in conformity to this manner; and,\n4. From the method of executing this plan in its full detail. Our first guides, the ancients, afford us no lights that can elucidate all these objects in general. The precepts which Aristotle lays down, relate to epic and dramatic poetry only; and which, by the way, confirms our idea, that antiquity itself made the essence of poetry to consist in fiction, and not in that species of verse which is delusive of it, or in that which is not capable of it. But since this art has risen to a great degree of perfection; and as poetry, like electricity, communicates its fire to every thing it touches, and animates and embellishes whatever it treats; there seems to be no subject in the universe to which poetry cannot be applied, and which it cannot render equally brilliant and pleasing. From this universality of poetry, from its peculiar property of expression by fiction, which is applicable to all subjects, have arisen its different species, of which a particular description will be given in the second part.\n\nHorace, in a well-known verse, has been supposed to declare the end of poetry to be twofold, to please, or to instruct:\n\n*Aut prodere volunt, aut declarare poetae.*\n\nBut Dr Beattie maintains, that the ultimate end of this art is to instruct; instruction being only one of the poetry means (and not always a necessary one) by which that end is to be accomplished. The passage rightly understood, he observes, will not appear to contain any part of thing inconsistent with this doctrine. The author is chap. i. there stating a comparison between the Greek and Roman writers, with a view to the poetry of the stage; and, after commending the former for their correctness, and for the liberal spirit wherewith they conducted their literary labours, and blaming his countrymen for their inaccuracies.\nEnd of Poetry.\n\nHor. Ar. Poet. 333\u2014347.\n\nHor. Carm. Mb. iv. ode 9.\n\nHor. Sat. fib. i. sat. 4. ver. 42.\n\nSect. II. Of the Standard of Poetical Invention.\n\nHomer's beautiful description of the heavens and earth, as they appear in a calm evening by the light of the moon and stars, concludes with this circumstance, \"And the heart of the shepherd is glad.\" Madame Dacier, from the turn she gives to the passage in her version, seems to think, and Pope, in order perhaps to make out his couplet, inferrates, that the gladness of the shepherd is owing to his sense of the utility of those luminaries. And this may in part be the case; but this is not in Homer; nor is it a necessary consideration. It is true, that, in contemplating the material universe, they who discern the causes and effects of things must be more rapturously entertained than those who perceive nothing but shape and size, colour and motion. Yet, in the mere outside of Nature's work, there is a splendour and a magnificence to which even untutored minds cannot attend without great delight.\n\nNot that all peasants or all philosophers are equally susceptible of these charming impressions. It is strange to observe the callousness of some men, before whom all the glories of heaven and earth pass in daily succession, without touching their hearts, elevating their fancy, or leaving any durable remembrance. Even of those who pretend to sensibility, how many are there to whom the lustre of the rising or setting sun; the sparkling concave of the midnight sky; the mountain-forest tossing and roaring to the storm, or warbling with all the melodies of a summer-evening; the sweet interchange of hill and dale, shade and sunlight, grove, lawn, and water, which an extensive landscape offers to the view; the scenery of the ocean, so lovely, so majestic, and so tremendous; and the many pleasing varieties of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, could never afford so much real satisfaction, as the teams and noise of a ball-room, the insipid fiddling and squeaking of an opera, or the vexations and wranglings of a card-table!\n\nBut some minds there are of a different make; who, even in the early part of life, receive from the contemplation of Nature a species of delight which they would hardly exchange for any other, and who, as avarice and ambition are not the infirmities of that period, would, with equal sincerity and rapture, exclaim,\n\nI care not, Fortune, what you me deny;\nYou cannot rob me of free Nature's grace;\nYou cannot shut the windows of the sky,\nThrough which Aurora shows her bright'ning face;\nYou cannot bar my constant feet to trace\nThe woods and lawns by living stream at eve.\n\nCaffe of Indolence.\n\nSuch minds have always in them the seeds of true taste, and frequently of imitative genius. At least, though their enthusiastic or visionary turn of mind (as the man of the world would call it) should not always incline them to practice poetry or painting, we need not scruple to affirm, that without some portion of this enthusiasm no person ever became a true poet or painter. For he who would imitate the works of nature, must first accurately observe them; and accurate observation is to be expected from those only who take great pleasure in it.\n\nTo a mind thus disposed no part of creation is indifferent. In the crowded city and howling wilderness; in the cultivated province and solitary isle; in the murmur of the rivulet and in the uproar of the ocean; in the radiance of summer and gloom of winter; in the thunder of heaven and in the whisper of the breeze; he still finds something to rouse or to soothe his imagination, to draw forth his affections, or to employ his understanding. And from every mental energy that is not attended with pain, and even from some of those that are, as moderate terror and pity, a sound mind derives satisfaction; exercise being equally necessary to the body and the soul, and to both equally productive of health and pleasure.\n\nThis happy sensibility to the beauties of nature should be cherished in young persons. It engages them to contemplate the Creator in his wonderful works; it purifies and harmonizes the soul, and prepares it for moral and intellectual discipline; it supplies an endless source of amusement; it contributes even to bodily health; and, as a first analogy subsists between material and moral beauty, it leads the heart by an easy transition from the one to the other; and thus recommends virtue for its transcendent loveliness, and makes vice appear the object\nobject of contempt and abomination. An intimate acquaintance with the best descriptive poets, Spenser, Milton, and Thomson, but above all with the divine Georigic, joined to some practice in the art of drawing, will promote this amiable sensibility in early years: for then the face of nature has novelty superadded to its other charms, the passions are not pre-engaged, the heart is free from care, and the imagination warm and romantic.\n\nBut not to insist longer on those ardent emotions that are peculiar to the enthusiastic disciple of nature, may it not be affirmed of all men, without exception, or at least of all the enlightened part of mankind, that they are gratified by the contemplation of things natural, as opposed to unnatural? Monstrous sights please but for a moment, if they please at all; for they derive their charm from the beholder's amazement, which is quickly over. We read indeed of a man of rank in Sicily*, who chooseth to adorn his villa with pictures and statues of most unnatural deformity: but it is a singular instance; and one would not be much more surprized to hear of a person living without food, or growing fat by the use of poison. To say of any thing, that it is contrary to nature, denotes censure and disapprobation on the part of the speaker; as the epithet natural intimates an agreeable quality, and seems for the most part to imply, that a thing is as it ought to be, suitable to our own taste, and congenial with our own constitution. Think with what sentiments we should peruse a poem, in which nature was totally misrepresented, and principles of thought and of operation supposed to take place, repugnant to every thing we had seen or heard of:\u2014in which, for example, avarice and coldness were ascribed to youth, and prodigality and passionate attachment to the old; in which men were made to act at random, sometimes according to character, and sometimes contrary to it; in which cruelty and envy were productive of love, and beneficence and kind affection of hatred; in which beauty was invariably the object of dislike, and ugliness of desire; in which society was rendered happy by atheism and the promiscuous perpetration of crimes, and justice and fortitude were held in universal contempt.\n\nOr think, how we should relish a painting, where no regard was had to the proportions, colours, or any of the physical laws, of Nature:\u2014where the ears and eyes of animals were placed in their shoulders; where the sky was green and the grass crimson; where trees grew with their branches in the earth and their roots in the air; where men were seen fighting after their heads were cut off, ships sailing on the land, lions entangled in cobwebs, sheep preying on dead carcases, fishes sporting in the woods, and elephants walking on the sea. Could such figures and combinations give pleasure, or merit the appellation of sublime or beautiful? Should we hesitate to pronounce their author mad? And are the absurdities of madmen proper subjects either of amusement or of imitation to reasonable beings?\n\nLet it be remarked, too, that though we distinguish our internal powers by different names, because otherwise we could not speak of them so as to be understood, they are all but so many energies of the same individual mind; and therefore it is not to be supposed, that what contradicts any one leading faculty should yield permanent delight to the rest. That cannot be agreeable to reason, which conscience disapproves; nor can that gratify imagination, which is repugnant to reason.\u2014Besides, belief and acquiescence of mind are pleasant, as distrust and disbelief are painful; and therefore, that only can give solid and general satisfaction, which has something of plausibility in it; something which we conceive it possible for a rational being to believe. But no rational being can acquiesce in what is obviously contrary to nature, or implies palpable absurdity.\n\nPoetry, therefore, and indeed every art whose end is to please, must be natural; and if so, must exhibit real matter of fact, or something like it; that is, in other words, must be either according to truth or according to verisimilitude.\n\nAnd though every part of the material universe abounds in objects of pleasurable contemplation, yet nothing in nature so powerfully touches our hearts, or gives so great variety of exercise to our moral and intellectual faculties, as man. Human affairs and human feelings are universally interesting. There are many who have no great relish for the poetry that delineates only irrational or inanimate beings; but to that which exhibits the fortunes, the characters, and the conduct of men, there is hardly any person who does not listen with sympathy and delight. And hence to imitate human action, is considered by Aristotle as essential to this art; and must be allowed to be essential to the most pleasing and most instructive part of it, Epic and Dramatic composition. Mere descriptions, however beautiful, and moral reflections, however just, become tiresome, where our passions are not occasionally awakened by some event that concerns our fellow-men. Do not all readers of taste receive peculiar pleasure from those little tales or episodes with which Thomson's descriptive poem on the Seasons is here and there enlivened? and are they not sensible, that the thunder-form would not have been half so interesting without the tale of the two lovers (Simm. v. 1171); nor the harvest-scene, without that of Palemon and Lavinia (Aut. v. 177.) nor the driving snows, without that exquisite picture of a man perishing among them (Winter, v. 276.) It is much to be regretted, that Young did not employ the same artifice to animate his Night-Thoughts. Sentiments and descriptions may be regarded as the pilasters, carvings, gildings, and other decorations of the poetical fabric: but human actions are the columns and the rafters that give it stability and elevation. Or, changing the metaphor, we may consider these as the soul which informs the lovely frame; while those are little more than the ornaments of the body.\n\nWhether the pleasure we take in things natural, and our dislike to what is the reverse, be the effect of habit or of constitution, is not a material inquiry. There is nothing absurd in supposing, that between the foul, in its first formation, and the rest of nature, a mutual harmony and sympathy may have been established, which experience may indeed confirm, but no perverse habits could entirely subdue. As no sort of education could make man believe the contrary of a self-evident axiom, great influence should imagine, that our love of nature and regularity of sentiment might still remain with us in some degree, though we had never been born and bred in the Sicilian villa above-mentioned, of course and never heard any thing applauded but what deserved upon cenure, nor cenured but what merited applause. Yet poetry, habit must be allowed to have a powerful influence over the\nthe sentiments and feelings of mankind; for objects to which we have been long accustomed, we are apt to contract a fondness: we conceive them readily, and contemplate them with pleasure; nor do we quit our old tracks of speculation or practice without reluctance and pain. Hence in part arises our attachment to our own professions, our old acquaintance, our native soil, our homes, and to the very hills, streams, and rocks in our neighborhood. It would therefore be strange, if man, accustomed as he is from his earliest days to the regularity of nature, did not contract a liking to her productions and principles of operation.\n\nYet we neither expect nor desire, that every human invention, where the end is only to please, should be an exact transcript of real existence. It is enough, that the mind acquiesce in it as probable or plausible, or such as we think might happen without any direct opposition to the laws of nature:\u2014Or, to speak more accurately, it is enough that it be consistent, either, first, with general experience; or, secondly, with popular opinion; or, thirdly, that it be consistent with itself, and connected with probable circumstances.\n\nFirst: If a human invention be consistent with general experience, we acquiesce in it as sufficiently probable. Particular experiences, however, there may be, so uncommon, and so little expected, that we should not admit their probability, if we did not know them to be true. No man of sense believes, that he has any likelihood of being enriched by the discovery of hidden treasure; or thinks it probable, on purchasing a lottery-ticket, that he shall gain the first prize; and yet great wealth has actually been acquired by such good fortune. But we should look upon these as poor expedients in a play or romance for bringing about a happy catastrophe. We expect that fiction should be more consonant to the general tenor of human affairs; in a word, that not possibility, but probability, should be the standard of poetical invention.\n\nSecondly: Fiction is admitted as conformable to this standard, when it accords with received opinions. These may be erroneous, but are not often apparently repugnant to nature. On this account, and because they are familiar to us from our infancy, the mind readily acquiesces in them, or at least yields them that degree of credit which is necessary to render them pleasing: hence the fairies, ghosts, and witches of Shakespeare, are admitted as probable beings; and angels obtain a place in religious pictures though we know that they do not now appear in the scenery of real life. A poet who should at this day make the whole action of his tragedy depend upon enchantment, and produce the chief events by the assistance of supernatural agents, would indeed be censured as transgressing the bounds of probability, be banished from the theatre to the nursery, and condemned to write fairy tales instead of tragedies. But Shakespeare was in no danger of such censures: In his days the doctrine of witchcraft was established both by law and by the fashion; and it was not only unpolite, but criminal, to doubt it. Now indeed it is admitted only by the vulgar; but it does not therefore follow that an old poem, invented built upon it should not be acceptable to the learned themselves. When a popular opinion has long been exploded, and has become repugnant to philosophical belief, the fictions built upon it are still admitted as natural, both because we all remember to have listened to them in childhood with some degree of credit, and because we know that they were accounted natural by the people to whom they were first addressed; whose sentiments and views of things we are willing to adopt, when, by the power of pleasing description, we are introduced into their scenes, and made acquainted with their manners. Hence we admit the theology of the ancient poets, their Elysium and Tartarus, Scylla and Charybdis, Cyclops and Circe, and the rest of those \"beautiful wonders\" (as Horace calls them) which were believed in the heroic ages; as well as the demons and enchantments of Fafo, which may be supposed to have obtained no small degree of credit among the Italians of the 16th century, and are suitable enough to the notions that prevailed universally in Europe not long before (a). In fact, when poetry is in other respects true, when it gives an accurate display of those parts of nature about which we know that men in all ages must have entertained the same opinion, namely, those appearances in the visible creation, and those feelings and working of the human mind, which are obvious to all mankind:\u2014when poetry is thus far according to nature, we are very willing to be indulgent to what is fictitious in it, and to grant a temporary allowance to any system of fable which the author pleases to adopt; provided that he lay the scene in a distant country, or fix the date to a remote period. This is no unreasonable piece of complaisance; we owe it both to the poet and to ourselves; for without it we should neither form a right estimate of his genius, nor receive from his works that pleasure which they were intended to impart. Let him, however, take care, that his system of fable be such as his countrymen and contemporaries (to whom his work is immediately addressed) might be supposed capable of yielding their assent to; for otherwise we should not believe him to be in earnest; and let him convey it as much as he can with probable circumstances, and make it appear in a series of events consistent with itself.\n\nFor (thirdly) if this be the case, we shall admit his story as probable, or at least as natural, and consequently be interested in it, even though it be not warranted by general experience, and derive but slender authority from popular opinion. Caliban, in the Tempest, would have shocked the mind as an improbability, if we had not been made acquainted with his origin, and seen his character displayed in a series of consistent behaviour. But when we are told that he sprung from a witch and a demon, a connection not contrary to the laws of nature, as they were understood in Shakespeare's time, and find his manners conformable to his descent, we are easily reconciled to the fiction. In the same sense, the Lilliputians of\n\n(a) In the 14th century, the common people of Italy believed that the poet Dante went down to hell; that the Inferno was a true account of what he saw there; and that his fellow complexion, and stunted beard (which seemed by its growth and colour to have been too near the fire), were the consequence of his passing so much of his time in that hot and smoky region. See Vicende della Letteratura del Sig. G. Denina, cap. 4.\nof Swift may pass for probable beings; not so much because we know that a belief in pignies was once current in the world (for the true ancient pigny was at least thrice as tall as those whom Gulliver visited), but because we find that every circumstance relating to them accords with itself, and with their supposed character. It is not the size of the people only that is diminutive; their country, seas, ships, and towns, are all in exact proportion; their theological and political principles, their passions, manners, customs, and all the parts of their conduct, betray a levity and littleness perfectly suitable; and so simple is the whole narration, and apparently so artless and sincere, that we should not much wonder if it had imposed (as we have been told it has) upon some persons of no contemptible understanding.\n\nThe same degree of credit may perhaps for the same reasons be due to his giants. But when he grounds his narrative upon a contradiction to nature; when he presents us with rational brutes, and irrational men; when he tells us of horses building houses for habitation, milking cows for food, riding in carriages, and holding conversations on the laws and politics of Europe; not all his genius (and he there exerts it to the utmost) is able to reconcile us to so monstrous a fiction: we may smile at some of his absurd exaggerations; we may be pleased with the energy of style, and accuracy of description, in particular places; and a malevolent heart may triumph in the satire; but we can never relish it as a fable, because it is at once unnatural and self-contradictory. Swift's judgement seems to have forsaken him on this occasion: he wallows in nastiness and brutality: and the general run of his satire is downright defamation. Lucian's True History, is a heap of extravagancies put together without order or unity, or any other apparent design than to ridicule the language and manner of grave authors. His ravings, which have no better right to the name of fable, than a hill of rubbish has to that of palace, are destitute of every colour of plausibility. Animal trees, ships sailing in the sky, armies of monstrous things travelling between the sun and moon on a pavement of cobwebs, rival nations of men inhabiting woods and mountains in a whale's belly,\u2014are like the dreams of a bedlamite than the inventions of a rational being.\n\nIf we were to prosecute this subject any farther, it would be proper to remark, that in some kinds of poetical invention a stricter probability is required than in others:\u2014that, for instance, Comedy, whether dramatic or narrative (B), must seldom deviate from the ordinary course of human affairs, because it exhibits the manners of real and even of familiar life.\u2014that the tragic poet, because he imitates characters more exalted, and generally refers to events little known, or long since past, may be allowed a wider range; but must never attempt the marvellous fictions of the epic muse, because he addresses his work, not only to the passions and imagination of mankind, but also to their eyes and ears, which are not easily imposed on, and refuse to be gratified with any representation that does not come very near the truth:\u2014that the epic poem may claim still ampler privileges, because its fictions are not subject to the scrutiny of any outward sense, and because it conveys information in regard both to the highest human characters, and the most important and wonderful events, and also to the affairs of unseen worlds and superior beings. Nor would it be improper to observe, that the several species of comic, of tragic, of epic composition, are not confined to the same degree of probability: for that farce may be allowed to be less probable than the regular comedy; the masque than the regular tragedy; and the mixed epic, such as the Fairy Queen, and Orlando Furioso, than the pure epopee of Homer, Virgil, and Milton. But this part of the subject seems not to require further illustration. Enough has been said to show, that nothing unnatural can please; and that therefore poetry, whose end is to please, must be according to nature.\n\nAnd if so, it must be either according to real nature, or according to nature somewhat different from the reality.\n\nSect. III. Of the System of Nature exhibited by Poetry.\n\nTo exhibit real nature is the business of the historian; who, if he were strictly to confine himself to his own sphere, would never record even the minutest circumstance of any speech, event, or description, which was not warranted by sufficient authority. It has been the language of critics in every age, that the historian ought to relate nothing as true which is false or dubious, and their works to conceal nothing material which he knows to be true, by fiction. But it is to be doubted whether any writer of profane and make history has ever been so scrupulous. Thucydides himself, who began his history when that war began which he records, and who set down every event soon after it happened, according to the most authentic information, seems, however, to have indulged his fancy not a little in his harangues and descriptions, particularly that of the plague of Athens: and the same thing has been practised, with greater latitude, by Livy and Tacitus, and more or less by all the best historians both ancient and modern. Nor are they to be blamed for it. By these improved or invented speeches, and by the heightenings thus given to their descriptions, their work becomes more interesting, and more useful; nobody is deceived, and historical truth is not materially affected. A medium is, however, to be observed in this, as in other things. When the historian lengthens a description into a detail of fictitious events, as Voltaire has done in his account of the battle of Fontenoy, he loses his credit with us, by raising a suspicion that he is more intent upon a pretty story than upon the truth. And we are disgusted with his insincerity, when, in defiance even of verisimilitude, he puts long elaborate orations in the mouth of those, of whom we know, either from the circumstances that they could not, or from more authentic records that they did not, make any such orations; as Dionysius of Halicarnassus has done in the case of Volumnia haranguing her son Coriolanus, and Flavius Josephus in that of Judah addressing his brother as viceroy of Egypt. From what these historians relate, one would conjecture\n\n(B) Fielding's Tom Jones, Amelia, and Joseph Andrews, are examples of what may be called the Epic or Narrative Comedy, or more properly perhaps the Comic Epopee.\nOf Nature conjecture that the Roman matron had studied at Athens under some long-winded rhetorician, and that the Jewish patriarch must have been one of the most flowery orators of antiquity. But the fictitious part of history, or of story-telling, ought never to take up much room; and must be highly blameable when it leads into any mistake either of facts or of characters.\n\nNow, why do historians take the liberty to embellish their works in this manner? One reason, no doubt, is, that they may display their talents in oratory and narration; but the chief reason, as hinted already, is, to render their composition more agreeable. It would seem, then, that something more pleasing than real nature, or something which shall add to the pleasing qualities of real nature, may be devised by human fancy. And this may certainly be done. And this it is the poet's business to do. And when this is in any degree done by the historian, his narrative becomes in that degree poetical.\n\nThe possibility of thus improving upon nature must be obvious to every one. When we look at a landscape, we can fancy a thousand additional embellishments. Mountains lovelier and more picturesque; rivers more copious, more limpid, and more beautifully winding; smoother and wider lawns; valleys more richly diversified; caverns and rocks more gloomy and more stupendous; ruins more majestic; buildings more magnificent; oceans more varied with islands, more splendid with shipping, or more agitated by storms, than any we have ever seen\u2014it is easy for human imagination to conceive. Many things in art and nature exceed expectation; but nothing sensible transcends or equals the capacity of thought\u2014a striking evidence of the dignity of the human soul! The finest woman in the world appears to every eye susceptible of improvement, except perhaps to that of her lover. No wonder, then, if in poetry events can be exhibited more compact, and of more pleasing variety, than those delineated by the historian, and scenes of inanimate nature more dreadful or more lovely, and human characters more sublime and more exquisite, both in good and evil. Yet still let nature supply the groundwork and materials, as well as the standard, of poetical fiction. The most expert painters use a layman, or other visible figure, to direct their hand and regulate their fancy. Homer himself founds his two poems on authentic tradition; and tragic as well epic poets have followed the example. The writers of romance, too, are ambitious to interweave true adventures with their fables; and when it can be conveniently done, to take the outlines of their plan from real life. Thus the tale of Robinson Crusoe is founded on an incident that actually befell one Alexander Selkirk, a seafaring man, who lived several years alone in the island of Juan Fernandez: Smollet is thought to have given us several of his own adventures in the history of Roderic Random; and the chief characters in Tom Jones, Joseph Andrews, and Pamela, are said to have been copied from real originals. Dramatic comedy, indeed, is for the most part purely fictitious: for if it were to exhibit real events as well as present manners, it would become too personal to be endured by a well-bred audience, and degenerate into downright abuse; which appears to have been the case with the old comedy of the Greeks*. But in general, hints taken from real existence will be found to give no little grace and stability to fiction, even in the most fanciful poems. These hints, however, may be improved by the poet's imagination, and let off with every probable ornament that can be devised, confitently with the design and genius of the work; or in other words, with the sympathies that the poet means to awaken in the mind of his reader. For mere poetical ornament, when it fails to interest the affections, is not only useless, but improper; all true poetry being addressed to the heart, and intended to give pleasure by raising or soothing the passions\u2014the only effectual way of pleasing a rational and moral creature. And therefore we would take Horace's maxim to be universal in poetry:** \"Non satis est pulchra effe poema; dulcia junto.\"*** \"It is not enough that poems be beautiful; let them also be affecting.\"****\n\nFor that this is the meaning of the word dulcia in this place, is admitted by the best interpreters, and is indeed evident from the context.*****\n\nThat the sentiments and feelings of perceiving beings and when expressed in poetry, should call forth our affections, is natural enough; but can descriptions of inanimate things also be made affecting? certainly they can; as to the more they affect, the more they please us, and make them the more poetical we allow them to be. Virgil's Georgic is a noble specimen (and indeed the noblest in the world) of this sort of poetry. His admiration of external nature gains upon a reader of taste, till it rise to perfect enthusiasm. The following observations will perhaps explain this matter.\n\nEvery thing in nature is complex in itself, and bears innumerable relations to other things; and may therefore be viewed in an endless variety of lights, and consequently described in an endless variety of ways. Some descriptions are good, and others bad. An historical description, that enumerates all the qualities of any object, is certainly good, because it is true; but may be as uninteresting as a logical definition. In poetry, no uninteresting description is good however conformable to truth: for here we expect not a complete enumeration of qualities (the chief end of the art being to please), but only such an enumeration as may give a lively and interesting idea. It is not memory, or the knowledge of rules, that can qualify a poet for this sort of description; but a peculiar liveliness of fancy and sensibility of heart, the nature whereof we may explain by its effects, but we cannot lay down rules for the attainment of it.\n\nWhen our mind is occupied by any emotion, we naturally use words and meditate on things that are suitable to it and tend to encourage it. If a man were to write a letter when he is very angry, there would probably be something of vehemence or bitterness in the style, even though the person to whom he wrote were not the object of his anger. The same thing holds true of every other strong passion or emotion:\u2014while it predominates in the mind, it gives a peculiarity to our thoughts, as well as to our voice, gesture, and countenance: And hence we expect, that every performance introduced in poetry should see things through the medium of his ruling passion, and that his thoughts and language should be tinged accordingly. A melancholy man walking in a grove, attends to those things that suit and encourage his melancholy; the sighing of the wind in the trees, the murmuring of waters, the murmuring of darknes and solitude of the shades: A cheerful man in a garden...\nOf Nature the same place, finds many subjects of cheerful meditations, in the fingering of birds, the brisk motions of the babbling stream, and the liveliness and variety of the verdure. Persons of different characters, contemplating the same thing, a Roman triumph, for instance, feel different emotions, and turn their view to different objects. One is filled with wonder at such a display of wealth and power; another exults in the idea of conquest, and pants for military renown; a third, stung with clamour, and harried with contusion, wishes for silence, security, and solitude; one melts with pity to the vanquished, and makes many a sad reflection upon the insignificance of worldly grandeur, and the uncertainty of human things; while the buffoon, and perhaps the philosopher, considers the whole as a vain piece of pageantry, which, by its solemn procedure, and by the admiration of so many people, is only rendered the more ridiculous;\u2014and each of these persons would describe it in a way suitable to his own feelings, and tending to raise the same in others. We see in Milton's Allegro and Penorolo, how a different cast of mind produces a variety in the manner of conceiving and contemplating the same rural scenery. In the former of these excellent poems, the author personates a cheerful man, and takes notice of those things in external nature that are suitable to cheerful thoughts, and tend to encourage them: in the latter, every object described is serious and solemn, and productive of calm reflection and tender melancholy; and we should not be easily persuaded, that Milton wrote the first under the influence of sorrow, or the second under that of gladness. We often see an author's character in his works; and if every author were in earnest when he writes, we should oftener see it. Thomson was a man of piety and benevolence, and a warm admirer of the beauties of nature; and every description in his delightful poem on the Seasons tends to raise the same laudable affections in his reader. The parts of nature that attract his notice are those which an impious or hard-hearted man would neither attend to, nor be affected with, at least in the same manner. In Swift we see a turn of mind very different from that of the amiable Thomson; little relish for the sublime or beautiful, and a perpetual succession of violent emotions. All his pictures of human life seem to show, that deformity and meanness were the favourite objects of his attention, and that his soul was a constant prey to indignation (c), disgust, and other gloomy passions, arising from such a view of things. And it is the tendency of almost all his writings (though it was not always the author's design), to communicate the same passions to his reader: inasmuch, that notwithstanding his erudition and knowledge of the world, his abilities as a popular orator and man of bufonics, the energy of his style, the elegance of some of his verses, and his extraordinary talents in wit and humour, there is reason to doubt, whether by studying his works any person was very much improved in piety or benevolence.\n\nAnd thus we see, how the compositions of an ingenious author may operate upon the heart, whatever be the subject. The affections that prevail in the author of Nature himself, direct his attention to objects congenial, and give a peculiar bias to his inventive powers, and a peculiar colour to his language. Hence his work, as well as face, if nature is permitted to exert herself freely in it, will that poetry exhibit a picture of his mind, and awaken correspondent affections in the reader. When these are favourable to virtue, which they always ought to be, the work will have that sweet pathos to which Horace alludes in the passage above mentioned; and which we so highly admire, and so warmly approve, even in those parts of the Georgic that describe inanimate nature.\n\nHorace's account of the matter in question differs not from what is here given. \"It is not enough (says he) *Ar. Poet. that poems be beautiful; let them be affecting, and v.99\u2014111 agitate the mind with whatever passions the poet wishes to impart. The human countenance, as it smiles on those who smile, accompanies also with sympathetic tears those who mourn. If you would have me weep, you must first weep yourself; then, and not before, shall I be touched with your misfortunes.\u2014For nature first makes the emotions of our mind correspond with our circumstances, infusing real joy, sorrow, or resentment, according to the occasion; and afterwards gives the true pathetic utterance to the voice and language.\" This doctrine, which concerns the orator and the player no less than the poet, is strictly philosophical, and equally applicable to dramatic, to descriptive, and indeed to every species of interesting poetry. The poet's sensibility must first of all engage him warmly in his subject, and in every part of it; otherwise he will labour in vain to interest the reader. If he would paint external nature, as Virgil and Thomson have done, so as to make her amiable to others, he must first be enamoured of her himself; if he would have his heroes and heroines speak the language of love or sorrow, devotion or courage, ambition or anger, benevolence or pity, his heart must be susceptible of those emotions, and in some degree feel them, as long at least as he employs himself in framing words for them; being assured, that\n\nHe best shall paint them who can feel them most.\n\nPope's Eloisa, v. 366.\n\nThe true poet, therefore, must not only study nature, and know the reality of things, but must also possess fancy, to invent additional decorations; judgment, to direct him in the choice of such as accord with verisimilitude; and sensibility, to enter with ardent emotions into every part of his subject, so as to transmute into every part of his work a pathos and energy sufficient to raise corresponding emotions in the reader.\n\n\"The historian and the poet (says Aristotle *) differ in this, that the former exhibits things as they are, i.e., in that state of perfection which is consistent with probability, and in which, for the sake of our own gratification, we wish to find them. If the poet, after all the liberties he is allowed to take with the truth, can produce nothing more exquisite than is commonly to be met with in history, his reader\n\n(c) For part of this remark we have his own authority, often in his letters, and very explicitly in the Latin epitaph which he composed for himself:\u2014\"ubi sev\u00e6 indignatio ulterius cor lacere nequit.\" See his last will and testament.\nOf Nature reader will be disappointed and dissatisfied. Poetical representations must therefore be framed after a pattern of the highest probable perfection that the genius of the work will admit;\u2014external nature must in them be more picturesque than in reality; action more animated; sentiments more expressive of the feelings and character, and more suitable to the circumstances of the speaker; personages better accomplished in those qualities that raise admiration, pity, terror, and other ardent emotions; and events more compact, more clearly connected with causes and consequences, and unfolded in an order more flattering to the fancy, and more interesting to the passions. But where, it may be said, is this pattern of perfection to be found? Not in real nature; otherwise history, which delineates real nature, would also delineate this pattern of perfection. It is to be found only in the mind of the poet; and it is imagination, regulated by knowledge, that enables him to form it.\n\nIn the beginning of life, and while experience is confined to a small circle, we admire every thing, and are pleased with very moderate excellence. A peasant thinks the hall of his landlord the finest apartment in the universe, listens with rapture to the strutting ballad-finger, and wonders at the rude wooden cuts that adorn his ruder compositions. A child looks upon his native village as a town; upon the brook that runs by as a river; and upon the meadows and hills in the neighborhood as the most spacious and beautiful that can be. But when, after long absence, he returns in his declining years, to visit once before he die, the dear spot that gave him birth, and those scenes whereof he remembers rather the original charms than the exact proportions; how is he disappointed to find every thing so debased and so diminished! The hills seem to have sunk into the ground, the brook to be dried up, and the village to be forsaken of its people; the parish-church, stripped of all its fancied magnificence, is become low, gloomy, and narrow; and the fields are now only the miniature of what they were. Had he never left this spot, his notions might have remained the same as at first; and had he travelled but a little way from it, they would not perhaps have received any material enlargement. It seems then to be from observation of many things of the same or similar kinds, that we acquire the talent of forming ideas more perfect than the real objects that lie immediately around us; and these ideas we may improve gradually more and more, according to the technical fancy, vivacity of our mind, and extent of our experience, till at last we come to raise them to a degree of perfection superior to anything to be found in real life. There cannot be any mystery in this doctrine; for we think and speak to the same purpose every day. Thus nothing is more common than to say, that each an artist excels all we have ever known in his profession, and yet that we can still conceive a superior performance. A morality, by bringing together into one view the separate virtues of many persons, is enabled to lay down a system of duty more perfect than any he has ever seen exemplified in human conduct. Whatever be the emotion the poet intends to raise in his reader, whether admiration or terror, joy or sorrow; and whatever be the object he would exhibit, whether Venus or Tityphone, Achilles or Theseus, a palace or a pile of ruins, a dance or a battle; he generally copies an idea of his own imagination; considering each quality as it is found to exist in several individuals of a species, and hence forming an assemblage more or less perfect in its kind, according to the purpose to which he means to apply it.\n\nHence it would appear, that the ideas of poetry are poetical rather general than singular; rather collected from the examination of a species or class of things, than copied from an individual. And this, according to Aristotle, is in fact the case, at least for the most part; whence that critic determines, that poetry is something more exquisite and more philosophical than history. The historian may describe Bucephalus, but the poet delineates a war-horse; the former must have seen the animal he speaks of, or received authentic information concerning it, if he mean to describe it historically; for the latter, it is enough that he has seen several animals of that sort. The former tells us, what Achilles actually did and said; the latter, what such a species of human character as that which bears the name of Achilles would probably do or say in certain given circumstances.\n\nIt is indeed true, that the poet may, and often does, copy after individual objects. Homer, no doubt, took his characters from the life; or at least, in forming them, was careful to follow tradition as far as the nature of his plan would allow. But he probably took the freedom to add or heighten some qualities, and take away others; to make Achilles, for example, stronger, perhaps, and more impetuous, and more eminent for filial affection, and Hector more patriotic and more amiable than he really was. If he had not done this, or something like it, his work would have been rather a history than a poem; would have exhibited men and things as they were, and not as they might have been; and Achilles and Hector would have been the names of individual and real heroes; whereas, according to Aristotle, they are rather to be considered as two distinct modifications or species of the heroic character. Shakespeare's account of the cliffs of Dover comes so near the truth, that we cannot doubt of its having been written by one who had seen them; but he who takes it for an exact historical description, will be surprised when he comes to the place, and finds those cliffs not half so lofty as the poet had made him believe. An historian would be to blame for such amplification; because, being to describe an individual precipice, he ought to tell us just what it is; which if he did, the description would suit that place, and perhaps no other in the whole world. But the poet means only to give an idea of what such a precipice may be; and therefore his description may perhaps be equally applicable to many such chalky precipices on the sea-shore.\n\nThis method of copying after general ideas formed by the artist from observation of many individuals, distinguishes the Italian and all the sublime painters, from the Dutch and their imitators. These give us bare nature, with the imperfections and peculiarities of individual things or persons; but those give nature improved as far as probability and the design of the piece will admit. Teniers and Hogarth draw faces, and figures, and dresses, from real life, and present manners; and therefore their pieces must in some degree lose the effect, and become awkward, when the prevalent fashions become obsolete.\u2014Raphael and Reynolds take their models from general nature; avoiding as far\nOf Nature far as possible, (at least in all their great performances), those peculiarities that derive their beauty from mere fashion; and therefore their works must give pleasure, and appear elegant, as long as men are capable of forming general ideas, and of judging from them. The last-mentioned incomparable artist is particularly observant of children, whose looks and attitudes, being left under the control of art and local manners, are more characteristic of the species than those of men and women. This field of observation has supplied him with many fine figures, particularly that most exquisite one of Comedy, struggling for and winning (for who could resist her!) the affections of Garrick\u2014a figure which could never have occurred to the imagination of a painter who had confined his views to grown persons looking and moving in all the formality of polite life\u2014a figure which in all ages and countries would be pronounced natural and engaging; whereas those human forms that we see every day bowing and courting, and strutting, and turning out their toes secundum artem, and drested in ruffles, and wigs, and flounces, and hoop-petticoats, and full-trimmed suits, would appear elegant no further than the present fashions are propagated, and no longer than they remain unaltered.\n\nThere is, in the progress of human society, as well as of human life, a period to which it is of great importance for the higher order of poets to attend, and from which they will do well to take their characters, and manners, and the era of their events; namely, that wherein men are raised above savage life, and considerably improved by arts, government, and conversation; but not advanced so high in the affect towards politeness, as to have acquired a habit of disguising their thoughts and passions, and of reducing their behaviour to the uniformity of the mode. Such was the period which Homer had the good fortune (as a poet) to live in, and to celebrate. This is the period at which the manners of men are most picturesque, and their adventures most romantic. This is the period when the appetites unperverted by luxury, the powers unnervated by effeminacy, and the thoughts disengaged from artificial restraint, will, in persons of similar dispositions and circumstances, operate in nearly the same way; and when, consequently, the characters of particular men will approach to the nature of poetical or general ideas, and, if well imitated, give pleasure to the whole, or at least to a great majority of mankind. But a character tinctured with the fashions of polite life would not be so generally interesting. Like a human figure adjusted by a modern dancing-master, and drested by a modern tailor, it may have a good effect in satire, comedy, or farce: but if introduced into the higher poetry, it would be admired by those only who had learned to admire nothing but present fashions, and by them no longer than the present fashions lasted; and to all the rest of the world would appear awkward, unaffected, and perhaps ridiculous. But Achilles and Sarpedon, Diomede and Hector, Neftor and Ulysses, as drawn by Homer, must in all ages, independently on fashion, command the attention and admiration of mankind. These have the qualities that are universally known to belong to human nature; whereas the modern fine gentleman is distinguished by qualities that belong only to a particular age, society, and corner of the world. We speak not of moral or intellectual virtues, which are objects of admiration to every age; but of those outward accomplishments, and that particular temperature of the passions, which form the most perceptible part of a human character.\u2014As, therefore, the politician, in discoursing the rights of mankind, must often allude to an imaginary state of nature; so the poet who intends to raise admiration, pity, terror, and other important emotions, in the generality of mankind, especially in those readers whose minds are most improved, must take his pictures of life and manners, rather from the heroic period we now speak of, than from the ages of refinement; and must therefore (to repeat the maxim of Aristotle) \"exhibit things, not as they are, but as they might be.\"\n\nSect. IV. Of Poetical Characters.\n\nHorace seems to think, that a competent knowledge of moral philosophy will fit an author for afflicting the delineation of the suitable qualities and duties to each poetical personage: (Art. Poet. v. 359.\u2014316.) The maxim may be true, as far as mere morality is the aim of the poet; but cannot be understood to refer to the delineation of poetical characters in general: for a thorough acquaintance with all the moral philosophy in the world would not have enabled Blackmore to paint such a personage as Homer's Achilles, Shakespeare's Othello, or the Satan of Paradise Lost. To a competency of moral science, there must be added an extensive knowledge of mankind, a warm and elevated imagination, and the greatest sensibility of heart, before a genius can be formed equal to so difficult a task. Horace is indeed sensible of the danger of introducing a new character in poetry, that he even discourages the attempt, and advises the poet rather to take his person from the ancient authors, or from tradition: Ibid. v. 119.\u2014139.\n\nTo conceive the idea of a good man, and to invent and support a great poetical character, are two very different things, however they may seem to have been confounded by some late critics. The first is easy to any person sufficiently instructed in the duties of life: the last is perhaps of all the efforts of human genius the most difficult; so very difficult, that though attempted by many, Homer, Shakespeare, and Milton, are almost the only authors who have succeeded in it. But characters of perfect virtue are not the most proper for poetry. It seems to be agreed, that the Deity should not be introduced in the machinery of a poetical fable. To ascribe to him words and actions of our own invention, seems very unbecoming; nor can a poetical description, that is known to be, and must of necessity be, infinitely inadequate, ever satisfy the human mind. Poetry, according to the best critics, which is an imitation of human action; and therefore poetical characters, though elevated, should fill partake of the passions and frailties of humanity. If it were not for the vices of some principal personages, the Iliad facilities of would not be either so interesting or so moral: the humanity; most moving and most eventful parts of the \u00c6neid are those that describe the effects of unlawful passion\u2014the most instructive tragedy in the world, we mean Macbeth, is founded in crimes of dreadful enormity:\u2014and if Milton had not taken into his plan the fall of our first parents, as well as their state of innocence,\nOf poetical his divine poem must have wanted much of its pathos, and could not have been (what it now is) such a treasure of important knowledge, as no other uninspired writer ever comprehended in so small a compass.\n\nVirtue, like truth, is uniform and unchangeable. We may anticipate the part a good man will act in any given circumstances; and therefore the events that depend on such a man must be less surprising than those which proceed from passion; the vicissitudes whereof it is frequently impossible to foresee. From the violent temper of Achilles, in the Iliad, spring many great incidents; which could not have taken place, if he had been calm and prudent like Ulysses, or pious and patriotic like Eneas: his rejection of Agamemnon's offers, in the ninth book, arises from the violence of his resentment\u2014his yielding to the request of Patroclus, in the 16th, from the violence of his friendship (if we may so speak) counteracting his resentment; and his restoring to Priam the dead body of Hector, in the 24th, from the violence of his affection to his own aged father, and his regard to the command of Jupiter, counteracting, in some measure, both his sorrow for his friend, and his thirst for vengeance.\u2014Besides, except where there is some degree of vice, it pains us too exquisitely to see misfortune; and therefore poetry would cease to have a pleasurable influence over our tender passions, if it were to exhibit virtuous characters only. And as in life, evil is necessary to our moral probation, and the possibility of error to our intellectual improvement; so bad or mixed characters are useful in poetry, to give to the good such opposition, as puts them upon displaying and exercising their virtue.\n\nAll those personages, however, in whose fortune the poet means that we should be interested, must have agreeable and admirable qualities to recommend them to our regard. And perhaps the greatest difficulty in the art lies in suitably blending those faults which the poet finds it expedient to give to any particular hero, with such moral, intellectual, or corporeal accomplishments, as may engage our esteem, pity, or admiration, without weakening our hatred of vice, or love of virtue. In most of our novels, and in many of our plays, it happens unluckily, that the hero of the piece is so captivating, as to incline us to be indulgent to every part of his character, the bad as well as the good. But a great master knows how to give the proper direction to human sensibility; and, without any perversion of our faculties, or any confusion of right and wrong, to make the same person the object of very different emotions, of pity and hatred, of admiration and horror. Who does not esteem and admire Macbeth for his courage and generosity? who does not pity him when beset with all the terrors of a pregnant imagination, superstitious temper, and awakened conscience? who does not abhor him as a monster of cruelty, treachery, and ingratitude? His good qualities, by drawing us near to him, make us, as it were, eye-witnesses of his crime, and give us a fellow-feeling of his remorse; and therefore, his example cannot fail to have a powerful effect in cherishing our love of virtue, and fortifying our minds against criminal impositions; whereas, had he wanted those good qualities, we should have kept aloof from his concerns, or viewed them with a superficial attention; in which case his example would have had little more weight than that of the robber, of whom we know nothing, but that he was tried, condemned, and executed.\u2014Satan, in Paradise Lost, is a character drawn and supported with the most consummate judgement. The old furies and demons, Hecate, Tiphon, Alecto, Megara, are objects of unmixed and unmitigated abhorrence; Titus, Enceladus, and their brethren, are remarkable for nothing but impiety, deformity, and vastness of size; Pluto is, at best, an insipid personage; Mars, a hair-brained ruffian; Tasso's infernal tyrant, an ugly and overgrown monster\u2014but in the Miltonic Satan, we are forced to admire the majesty of the ruined archangel, at the same time that we detest the unconquerable depravity of the fiend. \"But, of all poetical characters, (says the elegant critic from whom we are extracting), the Achilles of Homer (D) seems to me the most exquisite of invention, and the most highly finished. The utility of this character in a moral view is obvious; for it may be considered as the source of all the morality of the Iliad. Had not the generous and violent temper of Achilles determined him to patronize the augur Calchas in defiance of Agamemnon, and afterwards, on being affronted by that vindictive commander, to abandon for a time the common cause of Greece\u2014the fatal effects of dissension among confederates, and of capricious and tyrannical behaviour in a sovereign, would not have been the leading moral of Homer's poetry; nor could Hector, Sarpedon, Eneas, Ulysses, and the other amiable heroes, have been brought forward to signalize their virtues, and to recommend themselves to the esteem and imitation of mankind.\n\n\"They who form their judgment of Achilles from the imperfect sketch given of him by Horace in the Ars Poetica, (v. 121, 122.) and consider him only as a hateful composition of anger, revenge, fierceness, obstinacy and pride, can never enter into the views of Ho-mer, nor be suitably affected with his narration. All these vices are no doubt, in some degree, combined in Achilles; but they are tempered with qualities of a different sort, which render him a most interesting character, and of course make the Iliad a most interesting poem. Every reader abhors the faults of this hero; and yet, to an attentive reader of Homer, this hero must be the object of esteem, admiration, and pity; for he has many good as well as bad affections, and is equally\n\n(D) \"I say the Achilles of Homer. Later authors have degraded the character of this hero, by supposing every part of his body invulnerable except the heel. I know not how often I have heard this urged as one of Homer's absurdities; and indeed the whole Iliad is one continued absurdity, on this supposition. But Homer all along makes his hero equally liable to wounds and death with other men. Nay, to prevent all mistakes in regard to this matter, (if those who cavil at the poet would but read his work), he actually wounds him in the right arm by the lance of Asteropoeus, in the battle near the river Scamander.\" See Iliad, xxii. verse 161\u2014168.\nviolent in all:\u2014Nor is he possessed of a single vice or virtue, which the wonderful art of the poet has not made subservient to the design of the poem, and to the progress and catastrophe of the action; so that the hero of the Iliad, considered as a poetical personage, is just what he should be, neither greater nor less, neither worse nor better.\u2014He is everywhere distinguished by an abhorrence of oppression, by a liberal and elevated mind, by a passion for glory, and by a love of truth, freedom, and sincerity. He is for the most part attentive to the duties of religion; and, except to those who have injured him, courteous and kind: he is affectionate to his tutor Phoenix; and not only pities the misfortunes of his enemy Priam, but in the most soothing manner administers to him the best consolation that Homer's poor theology could furnish. Though no admirer of the cause in which his evil destiny compels him to engage, he is warmly attached to his native land; and, ardent as he is in vengeance, he is equally so in love to his aged father Peleus, and to his friend Patroclus. He is not luxurious like Paris, or clownish like Ajax; his accomplishments are princely, and his amusements worthy of a hero. Add to this, as an apology for the vehemence of his anger, that the affront he had received was (according to the manners of that age) of the most atrocious nature; and not only unprovoked, but such as, on the part of Agamemnon, betrayed a brutal insensibility to merit, as well as a proud, selfish, ungrateful, and tyrannical disposition. And though he is often inexcusably furious; yet it is but justice to remark, that he was not naturally cruel (E); and that his wildest outrages were such as in those rude times might be expected from a violent man of invincible strength and valour, when exasperated by injury, and frantic with sorrow.\u2014Our hero's claim to the admiration of mankind is indisputable. Every part of his character is sublime and astonishing. In his person, he is the strongest, the swiftest, the most beautiful of men:\u2014this last circumstance, however, occurs not to his own observation, being too trivial to attract the notice of so great a mind. The Fates had put it in his power, either to return home before the end of the war, or to remain at Troy:\u2014if he chose the former, he would enjoy tranquillity and happiness in his own country to a good old age; if the latter, he must perish in the bloom of his youth:\u2014his affection to his father and native country, and his hatred to Agamemnon, strongly urged him to the first; but a desire to avenge the death of his friend determines him to accept the last, with all its consequences. This at once displays the greatness of his fortitude, the warmth of his friendship, and the violence of his sanguinary passions: and it is this that so often and so powerfully recommends him to the pity, as well as admiration, of the attentive reader.\"\n\nIt is equally a proof of rich invention and exact judgement in Homer, that he mixes some good qualities in all his bad characters, and some degree of imperfection in almost all his good ones.\u2014Agamemnon, notwithstanding his pride, is an able general, and a valiant man, and highly esteemed as such by the greater part of the army.\u2014Paris, though effeminate, and vain of his dress and person, is, however, good-natured, patient of reproach, not destitute of courage, and eminently skilled in music and other fine arts.\u2014Ajax is a huge giant; fearless rather from insensibility to danger, and confidence in his mighty arms, than from any nobler principle; boastful and rough; regardless of the gods, though not downright impious: yet there is in his manner something of frankness and blunt sincerity, which entitle him to a place in our esteem; and he is ever ready to assist his countrymen, to whom he renders good service on many a perilous emergency.\u2014The character of Helen, in spite of her faults, and of the many calamities whereof she is the guilty cause, Homer has found means to recommend to our pity, and almost to our love; and this he does, without seeking to extenuate the crime of Paris, of which the most respectable personages in the poem are made to speak with becoming abhorrence. She is so full of remorse, so ready on every occasion to condemn her past conduct, so affectionate to her friends, so willing to do justice to every body's merit, and withal so finely accomplished, that she extorts our admiration, as well as that of the Trojan senators.\u2014Menelaus, though sufficiently sensible of the injury he had received, is yet a man of moderation, clemency, and good-nature, a valiant soldier, and a most affectionate brother: but there is a dash of vanity in his composition, and he entertains rather too high an opinion of his own abilities, yet never overlooks nor undervalues the merit of others.\u2014Priam would claim unreserved esteem, as well as pity, if it were not for his inexcusable weaknesses, in gratifying the humour, and by indulgence abetting the crimes, of the most worthless of all his children, to the utter ruin of his people, family, and kingdom. Madame Dacier supposes, that he had lost his authority, and was obliged to fall in with the politics of the times: but of this there appears no evidence; on the contrary, he and his unworthy favourite Paris seem to have been the only persons of distinction in Troy who were adverse to the restoring of Helen. Priam's foible (if it can be called by so soft a name), however faulty, is not uncommon, and has often produced calamity both in private and public life. The Scripture gives a memorable instance in the history of the good old Eli.\u2014Sarpedon comes nearer a perfect character than any other of Homer's heroes; but the part he has to act is short. It is a character which one could hardly have expected in those rude times: a sovereign prince, who considers himself as a magistrate set up by the people for the public good, and therefore bound in honour and gratitude to be himself their example, and study to excel as much in virtue as in rank and authority.\u2014Hector is the favourite of every reader, and with good reason. To the truest valour he joins the most generous patriotism. He abominates the crime of Paris: but not being able to prevent the war, he thinks it his duty to defend his country, and his father and sovereign, to the last. He too, as well as Achilles, foresees his\n\n(E) See Iliad xxi. 100, and xxiv. 485\u2014673.\u2014In the first of these passages, Achilles himself declares, that before Patroclus was slain, he often spared the lives of his enemies, and took pleasure in doing it. It is strange, as Dr Beatie observes, that this should be left out in Pope's Translation.\nOf poetical his own death; which heightens our compassion, and\nraises our idea of his magnanimity. In all the relations\nof private life, as a son, a father, a husband, a brother,\nhe is amiable in the highest degree; and he is distin-\nguished among all the heroes for tenderness of affection,\ngentleness of manners, and a pious regard to the duties\nof religion. One circumstance of his character, strongly\nexpressive of a great and delicate mind, we learn\nfrom Helen's lamentation over his dead body, that he\nwas almost the only person in Troy who had always\ntreated her with kindness, and never uttered one reproachful word to give her pain, nor heard others reproach her without blaming them for it. Some tendency to ostentation (which, however, may be pardonable in a commander in chief), and temporary fits of timidity, are the only blemishes discoverable in this hero; whose portrait Homer appears to have drawn with an affectionate and peculiar attention.\n\nBy ascribing so many amiable qualities to Hector and some others of the Trojans, the poet interests us in the fate of that people, notwithstanding our being continually kept in mind that they are the injurious party. And by thus blending good and evil, virtue and frailty, in the composition of his characters, he makes them the more conformable to the real appearances of human nature, and more useful as examples for our improvement; and at the same time, without hurting verisimilitude, gives every necessary embellishment to particular parts of his poem, and variety, coherence, and animation, to the whole fable. And it may also be observed, that though several of his characters are complex, not one of them is made up of incompatible parts; all are natural and probable, and such as we think we have met with, or might have met with, in our intercourse with mankind.\n\nFrom the same extensive views of good and evil, in all their forms and combinations, Homer has been enabled to make each of his characters perfectly distinct in itself, and different from all the rest; inasmuch, that before we come to the end of the Iliad, we are as well acquainted with his heroes, as with the faces and tempers of our most familiar friends. Virgil, by confining himself to a few general ideas of fidelity and fortitude, has made his subordinate heroes a very good sort of people; but they are all the same, and we have no clear knowledge of any one of them. Achates is faithful, and Gyas is brave, and Cloanthus is brave; and this is all we can say of the matter. We see these heroes at a distance, and have some notion of their shape and size; but are not near enough to distinguish their features; and every face seems to exhibit the same faint and ambiguous appearance. But of Homer's heroes we know every particular that can be known. We eat, and drink, and talk, and fight, with them; we see them in action and out of it; in the field and in their tents and housetops; the very face of the country about Troy we seem to be as well acquainted with as if we had been there. Similar characters there are among these heroes, as there are similar faces in every society; but we never mistake one for another. Neoptolemus and Ulysses are both wise and both eloquent; but the wisdom of the former seems to be the effect of experience; that of the latter of genius: the eloquence of the one is sweet and copious, but not always to the purpose, and apt to degenerate into story-telling; that of the other is close, emphatic, and persuaive, and accompanied with a peculiar modesty and of poetical simplicity of manner. Homer's heroes are all valiant; yet each displays a modification of valour peculiar to himself; one is valiant from principle, another from constitution; one is rash, another cautious; one is impetuous and headstrong, another impetuous, but tractable; one is cruel, another merciful; one is insolent and often-tatious, another gentle and unassuming; one is vain of his person, another of his strength, and a third of his family.\u2014It would be tedious to give a complete enumeration. Almost every species of the heroic character is to be found in Homer.\n\nOf the agents in Paradise Lost, it has been observed* that \"the weakest are the highest and noblest of human beings, the original parents of mankind; with whose actions the elements consented; on whose rectitude or deviation of will depended the state of terrestrial nature, and the condition of all the future inhabitants of the globe. Of the other agents in the poem, the chief are such as it is irreverence to name on flight occasions: the rest are lower powers;\n\n\u2014Of which the least could wield\nThese elements, and arm him with the force\nOf all their regions:\n\nPowers, which only the control of Omnipotence re-\nstrains from laying creation waste, and filling the vast drawing\nexpanses of space with ruin and confusion. To display and distri-\nbute the motives and actions of beings thus superior, so far as minuting\nhuman reason can examine, or human imagination re-\npresent them, is the task which Milton undertook and racters in\nperformed. The characters in the Paradise Lost, which Paradise\nadmit of examination, are those of angels and of men:\nof angels good and evil; of man in his innocent and\nsinful state.\n\n\"Among the angels, the virtue of Raphael is mild and\nplacid, of easy condescension, and free communication:\nthat of Michael is regal and lofty, attentive to the dig-\nnity of his own nature. Abdiel and Gabriel appear oc-\ncasionally, and act as every incident requires: the foli-\ntary fidelity of Abdiel is very amiably painted.\n\n\"Of the evil angels, the characters are more diver-\nsified. To Satan such sentiments are given as suit the\nmost exalted and most depraved being. Milton has\nbeen censured for the impiety which sometimes breaks\nfrom Satan's mouth; for there are thoughts, it is justly\nremarked, which no observation of character can justify;\nbecause no good man would willingly permit them to\npass, however transiently, through his mind. This cen-\nsure has been thrown to be groundless by the great critic\nfrom whom we quote. To make Satan speak as a rebel,\nsays he, without any such expressions as might taint the\nreader's imagination, was indeed one of the great diffi-\nculties in Milton's undertaking; and I cannot but think\nthat he has extricated himself with great happiness.\nThere is in Satan's speeches little that can give pain to Milton's\npious ear. The language of rebellion cannot be the succe\nfame with that of obedience: the malignity of Satan's\nfoams in haughtiness and obstinacy; but his expressions\nare commonly general, and no otherwise offensive than\nas they are wicked.\u2014The other chiefs of the celestial\nrebellion are very judiciously discriminated; and the fe-\nrocious character of Moloch appears, both in the battle\nand in the council, with exact consistency.\n\n\"To\u2014\"\n\"To Adam and to Eve are given, during their innocence, such sentiments as innocence can generate and utter. Their love is pure benevolence and mutual veneration; their repasts are without luxury, and their diligence without toil. Their addresses to their Maker have little more than the voice of admiration and gratitude: fruition left them nothing to ask, and innocence left them nothing to fear. But with guilt enter distrust and discord, mutual accusations and stubborn self-defence: they regard each other with alienated minds, and dread their Creator as the avenger of their transgression; at last, they seek shelter in his mercy, fettered to repentance, and melt in supplication. Both before and after the fall, the different sentiments arising from difference of sex are traced out with inimitable delicacy and philosophical propriety. Adam has always that pre-eminence in dignity, and Eve in loveliness, which we should naturally look for in the father and mother of mankind.\"\n\nFrom what has been said, it seems abundantly evident,\u2014That the end of poetry is to please; and therefore that the most perfect poetry must be the most pleasing;\u2014that what is unnatural cannot give pleasure; and therefore that poetry must be according to nature:\u2014that it must be either according to real nature, or according to nature somewhat different from the reality;\u2014that, if according to real nature, it would give no greater pleasure than history, which is a transcript of real nature;\u2014that greater pleasure is, however, to be expected from it, because we grant it frequent indulgence, in regard to fiction, and the choice of words;\u2014and, consequently, that poetry must be, not according to real nature, but according to nature improved to that degree which is confident with probability and suitable to the poet's purpose.\u2014And hence it is that we call poetry, An imitation of nature.\u2014For that which is properly termed imitation has always in it something which is not in the original. If the prototype and transcript be exactly alike; if there be nothing in the one which is not in the other; we may call the latter a representation, a copy, a draught, or a picture, of the former; but we never call it an imitation.\n\nSect. V. Of Arrangement, Unity, Directions.\u2014Further remarks on Nature in Poetry.\n\nI. The origin of nations, and the beginnings of great events, are little known, and seldom interesting; whence the first part of every history, compared with the sequel, is somewhat dry and tedious. But a poet must, even in the beginning of his work, interest the readers, and raise high expectation; not by an affected pomp of style, far less by ample promises or bold professions; but by setting immediately before them some incident, striking enough to raise curiosity, in regard both to its causes and to its consequences. He must therefore take up his story, not at the beginning, but in the middle; or rather, to prevent the work from being too long, as near the end as possible; and afterwards take some proper opportunity to inform us of the preceding events, in the way of narrative, or by conversation of the persons introduced, or by short and natural digressions.\n\nThe action of both the Iliad and Odyssey begins about six weeks before its conclusion; although the principal events of the war of Troy are to be found in the former; and the adventures of a ten years' voyage, followed by the suppression of a dangerous domestic enemy, in the latter. One of the first things mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, is a plague, which Apollo in anger sent into the Grecian army commanded by Agamemnon and now encamped before Troy. Who this Agamemnon was, and who the Grecians were; for what reason they had come hither; how long the siege had lasted; what memorable actions had been already performed; and in what condition both parties now were:\u2014all this, and much more, we soon learn from occasional hints and conversations interspersed through the poem.\n\nIn the Aeneid, which, though it comprehends the transactions of seven years, opens within a few months of the concluding event, we are first presented with a view of the Trojan fleet at sea, and no less a person than Juno interesting herself to raise a storm for their destruction. This excites a curiosity to know something further: who these Trojans were, whence they had come, and whither they were bound; why they had left their own country, and what had befell them since they left it. On all these points, the poet, without quitting the track of his narrative, soon gives the fullest information: the storm riles; the Trojans are driven to Africa, and hospitably received by the queen of the country; at whose desire their commander relates his adventures.\n\nThe action of Paradise Lost commences not many days before Adam and Eve are expelled from the garden of Eden, which is the concluding event. This poem, as its plan is incomparably more sublime and more important than that of either the Iliad or Aeneid, opens with a far more interesting scene: a multitude of angels and archangels shut up in a region of torment and darkness, and rolling on a lake of unquenchable fire. Who these angels are, and what brought them into this miserable condition, we naturally wish to know; and the poet in due time informs us; partly from the conversation of the bands themselves; and more particularly by the mouth of a happy spirit, sent from heaven to caution the father and mother of mankind against temptation, and confirm their good resolutions by unfolding the dreadful effects of impiety and disobedience.\n\nThis poetical arrangement of events, so different from Beattie, the historical, has other advantages besides those arising ut supra, from brevity and compactness of detail: it is obviously more affecting to the fancy, and more alarming to the passions; and, being more suitable to the order and the poetical manner in which the actions of other men strike our imagination, is a more exact imitation of human affairs. I hear a sudden noise in the street, and run to see what is the matter. An insurrection has happened, a great multitude is brought together, and something very important is going forward. The scene before me is the first thing that engages my attention; and is in itself so interesting, that for a moment or two I look at it in silence and wonder. By and by, when I get time for reflection, I begin to inquire into the cause of all this tumult, and what it is the people would be at; and one who is better informed than I, explains the affair from the beginning; or perhaps I make this out for myself, from the words and actions of the persons principally concerned. This is a sort of picture of poetical arrangement, both in epic and dramatic composition; and this plan\nPart I.\n\nJian has been followed in narrative odes and ballads both ancient and modern.\u2014The historian pursues a different method. He begins perhaps with an account of the manners of a certain age, and of the political constitution of a certain country; then introduces a particular person, gives the story of his birth, connections, private character, pursuits, disappointments, and of the events that promoted his views, and brought him acquainted with other turbulent spirits like himself; and so proceeds, unfolding, according to the order of time, the causes, principles, and progress of the conspiracy, if that be the subject which he undertakes to illustrate. It cannot be denied, that this latter method is more favourable to clear information; but the former, compared with it, will be found to have all the advantages already specified, and to be more effectually productive of that mental pleasure which depends on the passions and imagination.\n\nII. If a work have no determinate end, it has no meaning; and if it have many ends, it will distract by its multiplicity. Unity of design, therefore, belongs in some measure to all compositions, whether in verse or prose. But to none is it more essential than to others; and to none so much as in the higher poetry. In certain kinds of history, there is unity sufficient if all the events recorded be referred to one person; in others, if to one period of time, or to one people, or even to the inhabitants of one and the same planet. But it is not enough that the subject of a poetical fable be the exploits of one person; for these may be of various and even of opposite sorts and tendencies, and take up longer time than the nature of poetry can admit:\u2014for less can a regular poem comprehend the affairs of one period or of one people:\u2014it must be limited to one great action or event, to the illustration of which all the subordinate events must contribute; and these must be so connected with one another, as well as with the poet's general purpose, that one cannot be changed, transposed, or taken away, without affecting the confidence and stability of the whole*. In itself an incident may be interesting, a character well drawn, a description beautiful; and yet, if it disfigure the general plan, or if it obstruct or encumber the main action, instead of helping it forward, a correct artist would consider it but as a gaudy superfluity or splendid deformity; like a piece of scarlet cloth sewed upon a garment of a different colour\u2020.\n\nHor. Ars Poet. v. \u00a75. Not that all the parts of the fable either are, or can be, equally essential. Many descriptions and thoughts, of little consequence to the plan, may be admitted for the sake of variety; and the poet may, as well as the historian and philosopher, drop his subject for a time, in order to take up an affecting or instructive digression.\n\nIII. The doctrine of poetical digressions and episodes has been largely treated by the critics. We shall here only remark, that, in estimating their propriety, three things are to be attended to:\u2014their connection with the fable or subject; their own peculiar excellence; and their subordination to the poet's design.\n\n(1.) Those digressions that both arise from and terminate in the subject, like the episode of the angel Raphael in Paradise Lost, and the transition to the death of Caesar and the civil wars in the first book of the Georgics, are the most artful, and if suitably executed claim the highest praise:\u2014those that arise from, but do not terminate in, the subject, are perhaps second in the order of merit; like the story of Dido in the Aeneid, and the encomium on a country life in the second book of the Georgics: those come next that terminate in, but do not rise from, the fable; of which there are several in the third book of the Aeneid, and in the Odyssey:\u2014and those that neither terminate in the fable nor rise from it are the least artful; and if they be long, cannot escape censure, unless their beauty be very great.\n\nBut (2.) we are willing to excuse a beautiful episode at whatever expense to the subject it may be introduced, peculiar excellence, They who can blame Virgil for obtruding upon them and the charming tale of Orpheus and Euridice in the fourth Georgic, or Milton for the apostrophe to Light in the beginning of his third book, ought to forfeit all title to the peril of good poetry; for of such divine strains one would rather be the author than of all the books of criticism in the world. Yet still it is better that an episode possess the beauty of connection, together with its own intrinsic elegance, than this without the other.\n\nMoreover, in judging of the propriety of episodes and their other familiar continuances, it may be expedient to attend to the poet's design, as distinguished from the fable or subject of the poem. The great design, for example, of Virgil, was to interest his countrymen in a poem written with a view to reconcile them to the person and government of Augustus. Whatever, therefore, in the poem tends to promote this design, even though it should in some degree hurt the contexture of the fable, is really a proof of the poet's judgment; and may be not only allowed, but applauded.\u2014The progress of the action of the Aeneid may seem to be too long obstructed in one place by the story of Dido, which, though it rises from the preceding part of the poem, has no influence upon the sequel; and, in another, by the episode of Cacus, which, without injury to the fable, might have been omitted altogether. Yet these episodes, interesting as they are to us and all mankind because of the transcendent merit of the poetry, must have been still more interesting to the Romans because of their connection with the Roman affairs; for the one accounts particularly for their wars with Carthage; and the other not only explains some of their religious ceremonies, but also gives a most charming rural picture of those hills and valleys in the neighbourhood of the Tiber, on which, in after times, their majestic city was fated to stand.\u2014And if we consider, that the design of Homer's Iliad was not only to show the fatal effects of diffusion among confederates, but also to immortalize his country, and celebrate the most distinguished families in it, we shall be inclined to think more favourably than critics generally do of some of his long speeches and digressions; which, though to us they may seem trivial, must have been very interesting to his countrymen on account of the genealogies and private history recorded in them.\u2014Shakespeare's historical plays, considered as dramatic fables, and tried by the laws of tragedy and comedy, appear very rude compositions; but if we attend to the poet's design (as the elegant critic has with equal truth and beauty explained it), we shall be forced to admire his judgement in the general conduct of those pieces, as well as unequalled success in the execution of particular parts.\n\nThere is yet another point of view in which these digressions may be considered. If they tend to elucidate any important character, or to introduce any interesting event not otherwise within the compass of the poem, or\nOf poetical to give an amiable display of any particular virtue, they may be intitled, not to our pardon only, but even to our admiration, however loofely they may hang upon the fable. All these three ends are effected by that most beautiful episode of Hector and Andromache in the fifth book of the Iliad; and the two last, by the no less beautiful one of Euryalus and Nissus in the ninth book of the \u00c6neid.\n\nIV. And now, from the position formerly established, that the end of this divine art is to give pleasure, it has been endeavoured to prove, that, whether in displaying the appearances of the material universe, or in imitating the workings of the human mind, and the varieties of human character, or in arranging and combining into one whole the several incidents and parts whereof his fable consists,\u2014the aim of the poet must be to copy nature, not as it is, but in that state of perfection in which, confluently with the particular genius of the work, and the laws of verisimilitude, it may be supposed to be.\n\nSuch, in general, is the nature of that poetry which is intended to raise admiration, pity, and other serious emotions. But in this art, as in all others, there are different degrees of excellence; and we have hitherto directed our view chiefly to the highest. All serious poets are not equally solicitous to improve nature. Euripides is said to have represented men as they were; Sophocles, more poetically, as they should or might be. Theocritus in his Idyls, and Spenser in his Shepherd's Calendar, give us language and sentiments more nearly approaching those of the Rus verum et barbarum \u00a7, than what we meet with in the Pastorals of Virgil and Pope. In the historical drama, human characters and events must be according to historical truth, or at least not so remote from it as to lead into any important misapprehension of fact. And in the historical epic poem, such as the Pharsalia of Lucan, and the Campaign of Addison, the historical arrangement is preferred to the poetical, as being nearer the truth. Yet nature is a little improved even in these poems. The persons in Shakespeare's historical plays, and the heroes of the Pharsalia, talk in verse, and suitably to their characters, and with a readiness, beauty, and harmony of expression, not to be met with in real life, nor even in history: speeches are invented, and, to heighten the description, circumstances added, with great latitude: real events are rendered more compact and more strictly dependent upon one another; and fictitious ones brought in, to elucidate human characters and diversify the narration.\n\nThe more poetry improves nature, by copying after general ideas collected from extensive observation, the more it partakes (according to Aristotle) of the nature of philosophy; the greater stretch of fancy and of observation it requires in the artist, the better chance it has to be universally agreeable.\n\nYet poetry, when it falls short of this perfection, may have great merit as an instrument of both instruction and pleasure. To most men, simple unadorned nature is, at certain times, and in certain compositions, more agreeable than the most elaborate improvements of art; as a plain short period, without modulation, gives a pleasing variety to a discourse. Many such portraits of simple nature there are in the subordinate parts both of Homer's and of Virgil's poetry: and an excellent effect they have in giving probability to the fiction, as well as gratifying the reader's fancy with images distinct and lively, and easily comprehended. The historical plays of Shakespeare raise not our pity and terror to such a height as Lear, Macbeth, or Othello; but they interest and instruct us greatly notwithstanding. The rudest of the eclogues of Theocritus, or even of Spenser, have by some authors been extolled above those of Virgil, because more like real life. Nay, Corneille is known to have preferred the Pharsalia to the \u00c6neid, perhaps from its being nearer the truth, or perhaps from the sublime sentiments of stoical morality so forcibly and so offensively displayed in it.\n\nPoets may refine upon nature too much as well as too little; for affectation and rusticity are equally remote from true elegance. The style and sentiments of comedy should no doubt be more correct and more pointed than those of the most polite conversation: but to make every footman a wit, and every gentleman and lady an epigrammatist, as Congreve has done, is an excessive and faulty refinement. The proper medium has been hit by Menander and Terence, by Shakespeare in his happier scenes, and by Garrick, Cumberland, and some others of late renown. To describe the passion of love with as little delicacy as some men speak of it would be unpardonable; but to transform it into mere Platonic adoration is to run into another extreme, less criminal indeed, but too remote from universal truth to be universally interesting. To the former extreme Ovid inclines, and Petrarch and his imitators to the latter. Virgil has happily avoided both: but Milton has painted this passion as distinct from all others, with such peculiar truth and beauty, that we cannot think Voltaire's encomium too high, when he says, that love in all other poetry seems a weakness, but in Paradise Lost a virtue. There are many good strokes of nature in Ramfay's Gentle Shepherd; but the author's passion for the rus verum betrays him into some indelicacies: a censure that falls with greater weight upon Theocritus, who is often absolutely indecent. The Italian pastoral of Tasso and Guarini, and the French of Fontanelle, run into the opposite extreme (though in some parts beautifully simple), and display a system of rural manners so quaint and affected as to outrage all probability. In fine, though mediocrity of execution in poetry be allowed to deserve the doom pronounced upon it by Horace; yet it is true, notwithstanding, that in this art, as in many other good things, the point of excellence lies in a middle between two extremes; and has been reached by those only who fought to improve nature as far as the genius of their work would permit, keeping at an equal distance from rusticity on the one hand, and affected elegance on the other.\n\nSect. VI. Of Poetical Language.\n\nWords in poetry are chosen, first, for their sense; words in and, secondly, for their sound. That the first of these is necessary to be chosen for grounds of choice is the more excellent nobody can deny. Their sense is a fool. Yet sound is to be attended to even in prose, and in verse demands particular attention. We shall consider poetical language, first, as significant; and, secondly, as susceptible of harmony.\n\u00a7 I. Of Poetical Language considered as SIGNIFICANT.\n\nIf, as it has been endeavoured to prove, poetry be imitative of nature, poetical fictions of real actions, poetical images of real appearances in the visible creation, and poetical personages of real human characters; it would seem to follow, that the language of poetry must be an imitation of the language of nature.\n\nAccording to Dr Beattie *, that language is natural which is suited to the speaker's condition, character, and circumstances. And as, for the most part, the images and sentiments of serious poetry are copied from the images and sentiments, not of real, but of improved, nature; so the language of serious poetry must (as hinted already) be a transcript, not of the real language of nature, which is often dissonant and rude, but of natural language improved as far as may be consistent with probability, and with the supposed character of the speaker.\n\nIf this be not the case, if the language of poetry be such only as we hear in conversation or read in history, it will, instead of delight, bring disappointment: because it will fall short of what we expect from an art which is recommended rather by its pleasurable qualities than by its intrinsic utility; and to which, in order to render it pleasing, we grant higher privileges than to any other kind of literary composition, or any other mode of human language.\n\nThe next inquiry must therefore be, \"What are those improvements that peculiarly belong to the language of poetry?\" And these may be comprehended under two heads; poetical words, and tropes and figures.\n\nArt. I. Of Poetical Words.\n\nOne mode of improvement peculiar to poetical diction results from the use of those words and phrases which, because they rarely occur in prose, and frequently in verse, are by the grammarians and lexicographers termed poetical. In these some languages abound more than others; but no language perhaps is altogether without them, and perhaps no language can be so in which any number of good poems have been written: for poetry is better remembered than prose, especially by poetical authors, who will always be apt to imitate the phraseology of those they have been accustomed to read and admire; and thus, in the works of poets down through successive generations, certain phrases may have been conveyed, which, though originally perhaps in common use, are now confined to poetical composition. Prose writers are not to apt to imitate one another, at least in words and phrases, both because they do not so well remember one another's phraseology, and also because their language is less artificial, and must not, if they would make it easy and flowing (without which it cannot be elegant), depart essentially from the style of correct conversation.\n\nPoets, too, on account of the greater difficulty of their numbers, have, both in the choice and in the arrangement of words, a better claim to indulgence, and stand more in need of a discretionary power.\n\nThe language of Homer differs materially from what was written and spoken in Greece in the days of Socrates. It differs in the mode of inflection, it differs in the syntax, it differs even in the words: so that one might read Homer with ease who could not read Xenophon; or Xenophon, without being able to read Homerus. Yet we cannot believe that Homer, or the first Greek poet who wrote in his style, would make choice of a dialect quite different from what was intelligible in his own time: for poets have in all ages written with a view to be read, and to be read with pleasure; which they could not be if their diction were hard to understand. It is more reasonable to suppose that the language of Homer is according to some ancient dialect, which, though not perhaps in familiar use among the Greeks at the time he wrote, was however intelligible. From the Homeric to the Socratic age, a period had elapsed of no less than 400 years; during which the style both of discourse and of writing must have undergone great alterations. Yet the Iliad continued the standard of heroic poetry, and was considered as the very perfection of poetical language; notwithstanding that some words in it were become antiquated, or so ambiguous, that Aristotle himself seems to have been somewhat doubtful in regard to their meaning. And Poetic if Chaucer's merit as a poet had been as great as Horace's, and the English tongue under Edward III., as perfect as the Greek was in the second century after the Trojan war, the style of Chaucer would probably have been our model for poetical diction at this day; even as Petrarch, his contemporary, is still imitated by the best poets of Italy.\n\nThe rudeness of the style of Ennius has been imputed by the old critics to his having copied too closely the dialect of common life. But this appears to be a mistake. For if we compare the fragments of that author with the comedies of Plautus, who flourished in the same age, and whose language was certainly copied from that of common life, we shall be struck with an air of antiquity in the former that is not in the latter. Ennius, no doubt, like most other sublime poets, affected something of the antique in his expression: and many of his words and phrases, not adopted by any prose-writer now extant, are to be found in Lucretius and Virgil, and were by them transmitted to succeeding poets. These The poetical form part of the Roman poetical dialect; which appears different from the writings of Virgil, where we have it in perfection, to have been very copious. The style of this charming poet is indeed so different from prose, and is altogether so peculiar, that it is perhaps impossible to analyse it on the common principles of Latin grammar. And yet no author can be more perspicuous or more expressive; notwithstanding the frequency of Greekism in his syntax, and his love of old words, which he, in the judgement of Quintilian, knew better than any other man how to improve into decoration.\n\nThe poetical dialect of modern Italy is so different from the prosaic, that persons who can read the historians, and even speak with tolerable fluency the language of that country, may yet find it difficult to construe a page of Petrarch or Tasso. Yet it is not probable, that Petrarch, whose works are a standard of the Italian poetical diction \u00a7, made any material innovations in his native tongue. It is rather probable that he wrote it nearly as it was spoken in his time, that is, in the 14th century; omitting only harsh combinations, and taking that liberty which Homer probably, and Virgil certainly, took before him, of reviving such old, but not obsolete expressions, as seemed peculiarly significant and melodious; and polishing his style to that degree of elegance which human speech, without becoming...\nPoetical words unnatural, may admit of, and which the genius of poetry, as an art subservient to pleasure, may be thought to require.\n\nThe French poetry in general is distinguished from prose rather by the rhyme and the measure, than by any old or uncommon phraseology. Yet the French, on certain subjects, imitate the style of their old poets, of Marot in particular; and may therefore be said to have something of a poetical dialect, though far less extensive than the Italian, or even than the English. And it may be presumed, that in future ages they will have more of this dialect than they have at present. This may be inferred from the very uncommon merit of some of their late poets, particularly Boiteau and La Fontaine, who, in their respective departments, will continue to be imitated, when the present modes of French prose are greatly changed: an event that, for all the pains they take to preserve their language, must inevitably happen, and whereof there are not wanting some prefigures already.\n\nThe English poetical dialect is not characterized by any peculiarities of intonation, nor by any great latitude in the use of foreign idioms. More copious it is, however, than one would at first imagine; as may appear from the following specimen and observations.\n\n(1.) A few Greek and Latin idioms are common in English poetry, which are seldom or never to be met with in prose. (Quenched by Hope.) Shakespeare.\u2014Shorn of his beams. Milton.\u2014Created thing nor valued he nor shun'd. Milton.\u2014'Tis thus we riot, while who sow it starve. Pope.\u2014This day be dread and peace my lot. Pope.\u2014Into what pit thou sel'st from what height fallen. Milton. He deceived the mother of mankind. What time his pride had cast him out of heaven. Milton.\u2014Some of these, with others to be found in Milton, seem to have been adopted for the sake of brevity, which in the poetical tongue is indispensible. For the same reason, perhaps the articles a and the are sometimes omitted by our poets, though less frequently in serious than burlesque composition.\u2014In English, the adjective generally goes before the substantive, the nominative before the verb, and the active verb before (what we call) the accusative. Exceptions, however, to this rule, are not uncommon even in prose. But in poetry they are more frequent. Their lonely joys, and destiny obscure. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the right; and all the air a solemn stillness holds. In general, that verification may be less difficult, and the cadence more uniformly pleasing; and sometimes, too, in order to give energy to expression, or vivacity to an image,\u2014the English poet is permitted to take much greater liberties than the prose-writer, in arranging his words, and modulating his lines and periods. Examples may be seen in every page of Paradise Lost.\n\n(2.) Some of our poetical words take an additional syllable, that they may suit the verse the better; as, disport, distain, disport, affright, enchain, for part, stain, sport, fright, chain. Others seem to be nothing else than common words made shorter, for the convenience of the versifier. Such are, auxiliar, fulminal, trump, vale, part, clime, fulmis, frolic, plain, drear, dread, helm, morn, mead, eye and even, gan, illume and illumine, ope, hoar, hide, savage, escape; for auxiliary, fulminary, trumpet, valley, depart, climate, submissive, frolic-\n\nfome, complain, dreary, dreadful, helmet, morning, meadow, evening, began or began to, illuminate, open, hoary, abide, affluage, escape.\u2014Of some of these the short form is the more ancient. In Scotland, even, morn, hide, savage, are still in vulgar use; but morn, except when contradistinguished to even, is synonymous, not with morning (as in the English poetical dialect), but with morrow. The Latin poets, in a way somewhat similar, and perhaps for a similar reason, shortened fundamentum, tutamentum, munimentum, &c. into fundament, tutamen, muniment.\n\n(3.) Of the following words, which are now almost peculiar to poetry, the greater part are ancient, and were once no doubt in common use in England, as many of them still are in Scotland. Afield, amain, annoy (a noun), anon, aye (ever), behoof, blithe, brand (sword), bridal, carol, dame (lady), fealty, fell (an adjective), gaude, gore, host (army), lambkin, late (of late), lay (poem), len, glade, gleam, hurl, lore, meed, orifion, pod (to travel laboriously), ringlet, rue (a verb) ruth, ruthless, sojourn (a noun), finite, speed (an active verb), fave (except), spray (twig), fleed, flaim (long), brand, swain, thrall, thrill, trail (a verb), troll, wall, weller, warble, wayward, woo, the while (in the mean time), yon, of yore.\n\n(4.) These that follow are also poetical; but, so far as appears, were never in common use. Appal, arraivy, attune, battalions, breezy, car (chariot), clarion, cates, courier, darkling, flicker, floweret, emblose, gairds, circlet, imperil, nightly, nofelefs, pinion (wing), shadowy, lumberous, firesamp, troublous, wilder (a verb), jostle (a verb), shook (shaken), madding, viewless.\u2014The following, too, derived from the Greek and Latin, seem peculiar to poetry. Clang, clangor, choral, bland, boreal, aire, ensanguined, ire, irreful, lave (to wash), nymph, (ladie, girl), orient, panoply, phantom, infuriate, rescind, radiant, rept, redolent, refugent, verdant, vernal, zeplify, zone (girdle), syjuen, suffe.\n\n(5.) In most languages, the rapidity of pronunciation abbreviates some of the commonest words, or even joins two, or perhaps more, of them, into one; and some of those abbreviated forms find admission into writing. The English language was quite disgusted by them in the end of the last century; but Swift, by his satire and example, brought them into disrepute: and, though some of them be retained in conversation, as don't, shan't, can't, they are now avoided in solemn style; and by elegant writers in general, except where the colloquial dialect is imitated, as in comedy. 'Tis and 'twas, since the time of Shattelbury, seem to have been daily losing credit, at least in prose; but still have a place in poetry, perhaps because they contribute to conciseness. 'Twas on a lofty vales side. Gray.\u2014'Tis true, 'tis certain, man, though dead, retains part of himself. Pope. In verse too, over may be shortened into o'er, (which is the Scotch, and probably was the old English, pronunciation); never into ne'er; and from the and to, when they go before a word beginning with a vowel, the final letter is sometimes cut off. O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go. Pope.\u2014Where'er she turns, the Graces homage pay. And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave. Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll. Gray.\u2014T'alarm th' eternal midnight of the grave.\u2014These abbreviations are now peculiar to the poetical tongue, but not necessary to it. They sometimes\nOf poetical sometimes promote brevity, and render verification less difficult.\n\n(6.) Those words which are commonly called compound epithets, as rosy-finger'd, rosy-bosom'd, many-twinkling, many-sounding, mus-grown, bright-eyed, straw-built, spirit-flaring, incense-breathing, heaven taught, love-whispering, lute-refraining, are also to be considered as part of our poetical dialect. It is true, we have compound-ed adjectives in familiar use, as high-peonied, well-natured, ill-bred, and innumerable others. But we speak of those that are less common, that seldom occur except in poetry, and of which in prose the use would appear affected. And that they sometimes promote brevity and vivacity of expression, cannot be denied. But as they give, when too frequent, a stiff and finical air to a performance; as they are not always explicit in the sense, nor agreeable in the sound; as they are apt to produce a confusion, or too great a multiplicity, of images; as they tend to disfigure the language, and furnish a pretext for endless innovation; they ought to be used sparingly; and those only used which the practice of popular authors has rendered familiar to the ear, and which are in themselves peculiarly emphatical and harmonious.\n\n(7.) In the transformation of nouns into verbs and participles, our poetical dialect admits of greater latitude than prose. Hymn, pillow, curtain, story, pillar, picture, peel, surge, cavern, honey, career, cincture, bosom, sphere, are common nouns; but to hymn, to pillow, curtained, pillared, pictured, pealing, surging, cavern'd, honied, careering, cinctured, bosomed, sphered, would appear affected in prose, and yet in verse they are warranted by great authorities, though it must be confessed that they are censured by an able critic* who had studied the English language, both poetical and profane, with wonderful diligence.\n\nSome late poets, particularly the imitators of Spenser, have introduced a great variety of uncommon words, as certes, estoons, ne, whilom, tranfnew, moil, fone, lofet, alse, hight, right, plight, thews, coulthul, affot, muchel, wend, arrear, &c. These were once poetical words, no doubt; but they are now obsolete, and to many readers unintelligible. No man of the present age, however conversant in this dialect, would naturally express himself in it on any interesting emergence; or, supposing this natural to the antiquarian, it would never appear so to the common hearer or reader. A mixture of these words, therefore, must ruin the pathos of modern language; and as they are not familiar to our ear, and plainly appear to be sought after and affected, will generally give a stiffness to modern verification. Yet in subjects approaching to the ludicrous they may have a good effect; as in the Schoolmirefs of Shenstone, Parnell's Fairy-tale, Thomson's Castle of Indolence, and Pope's lines in the Dunciad upon Wormius. But this effect will be most pleasing to those who have least occasion to recur to the glossary.\n\nIndeed, it is not always easy to fix the boundary between poetical and obsolete expressions. To many readers,\n\n* Johnson.\n\nlore, meed, beneft, bliche, gaude, pray, thrall, may already appear antiquated; and to some the style of Spenser, or even of Chaucer, may be as intelligible as that of Dryden. This however we may venture to affirm, that a word, which the majority of readers cannot understand without a glossary, may with reason be considered as obsolete; and ought not to be used in modern composition, unless revived, and recommended to the public ear, by some very eminent writer. There are but few words in Milton, as nathless, tine, frore, bofky, &c.; there are but one or two in Dryden, as falify (v); and in Pope, there are none at all, which every reader of our poetry may not be supposed to understand; whereas in Shakespeare, there are many, and in Spenser many more, for which one who knows English very well may be obliged to consult the dictionary. The practice of Milton, Dryden, or Pope, may therefore, in almost all cases, be admitted as good authority for the use of a poetical word. And in them, all the words above enumerated, as poetical, and in present use, may actually be found. And of such poets as may choose to observe this rule, it will not be said, either that they reject the judgment of Quintilian, who recommends the newest of the old words, and the oldest of the new, or that they are inattentive to Pope's precept;\n\nBe not the first by whom the new are tried,\nNor yet the last to lay the old aside.\n\nEff. on Crit. v. 335.\n\nWe must not suppose that these poetical words never occur at all except in poetry. Even from conversation they are not excluded: and the ancient critics allow, that they may be admitted into prose, where they occasionally confer dignity upon a sublime subject, or heighten the ludicrous qualities of a mean one. But it is in poetry only where the frequent use of them does not favour of affectation.\n\nNor must we suppose them essential to this art. Many passages there are of exquisite poetry, wherein not a single phrase occurs that might not be used in prose. In fact, the influence of these words in adorning English verse is not very extensive. Some influence however they have. They serve to render the poetical style, first, more melodious; and, secondly, more solemn.\n\nFirst, They render the poetical style more melodious, in which and more easily reducible into measure. Words of unlike they wieldy size, or difficult pronunciation, are never used by the poetical poets, where they can be avoided: unless in their style more found they have something imitative of the sense. Homer's melodious poetical inflections contribute wonderfully to the sweetness of his numbers: and if the reader is pleased to look back to the specimen above given of the English poetical dialect, he will find that the words are in general well-founded, and such as may coalesce with other words, without producing harsh combinations. Quintilian observes, that poets, for the sake of their verse, are indulged in many liberties, not granted to the orator, of lengthening, shortening, and dividing their words * \u2014 * Inquit Orat. lib. x. cap. i. \u00a7 3.\n\nAnd if the Greek and Roman poets claimed this indulgence, cap. i. \u00a7 3.\n\n(d) Dryden in one place (\u00c6neid ix. verf. 1995.) uses Falsified to denote Pierced through and through. He acknowledges, that this use of the word is an innovation; and has nothing to plead for it but his own authority, and that Falfare in Italian sometimes means the same thing.\nPoetry.\n\nOr poetical gence from necessity, and obtained it, the English, those words of them especially who write in rhyme, may claim it with better reason; as the words of their language are less musical and far less susceptible of variety in arrangement and syntax.\n\nSecondly, Such poetical words as are known to be ancient have something venerable in their appearance, and impart a solemnity to all around them. This remark is from Quintilian; who adds, that they give to a composition that call and colour of antiquity which in painting is so highly valued, but which art can never effectually imitate. Poetical words that are either not ancient, or not known to be such, have, however, a pleasing effect from association. We are accustomed to meet with them in sublime and elegant writing; and hence they come to acquire sublimity and elegance: Even as the words we hear on familiar occasions come to be accounted familiar; and as those that take their rise among pick-pockets, gamblers, and gypsies, are thought too indelicate to be used by any person of taste or good manners. When one hears the following lines, which abound in poetical words,\n\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\nThe cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\nNo more shall roule them from their lowly bed:\n\n\u2014one is as sensible of the dignity of the language, as one would be of the vileness or vulgarity of that man's speech, who should prove his acquaintance with Bridewell, by interlarding his discourse with such terms as mill-doll, queer cull, or noddling cheat; or who, in imitation of tops and gamblers, should on the common occasions of life, talk of being beat hollow, or saving his distance.\n\nWhat gives dignity to persons gives dignity to language. A man of this character is one who has borne important employments, been connected with honourable associates, and never degraded himself by levity or immorality of conduct. Dignified phrases are those which have been used to express elevated sentiments, have always made their appearance in elegant composition, and have never been profaned by giving permanency or utterance to the passions of the vile, the giddy, or the worthless. And as by an active old age, the dignity of such men is confirmed and heightened; so the dignity of such words, if they be not suffered to fall into disuse, seldom fails to improve by length of time.\n\nArt. II. Of Tropes and Figures.\n\nIf it appear that, by means of figures, language may be made more pleasing and more natural than it would be without them; it will follow, that to poetical language, whose end is to please by imitating nature, figures must be not only ornamental, but necessary. It will here be proper, therefore, first to point out the importance and utility of figurative language; secondly, to show, that figures are more necessary to poetry in general than to any other mode of writing.\n\nI. As to the importance and utility of figurative expression, in making language more pleasing and more natural; it may be remarked,\n\n(1.) That tropes and figures are often necessary to supply the unavoidable defects of language. When proper words are wanting, or not recollected, or when we do not choose to be always repeating them, we must have recourse to tropes and figures. When philosophers began to explain the operations of the mind, they found that most of the words in common use, being framed to answer the more obvious exigencies of life, were in their proper signification applicable to matter only and its supplying qualities. What was to be done in this case? Would they think of making a new language to express the qualities of mind? No; that would have been difficult and impracticable; and granting it both practicable and easy, they must have foreseen, that nobody would read or listen to what was thus spoken or written in a new and consequently in an unknown tongue. They therefore took the language as they found it; and wherever they thought there was a similarity or analogy between the qualities of the mind and the qualities of matter, scrupled not to use the names of the material qualities tropically, by applying them to the mental qualities. Hence came the phrases solidity of judgement, warmth of imagination, enlargement of understanding, and many others; which, though figurative, express the meaning just as well as proper words would have done. In fact, numerous as the words in every language are, they must always fall short of the unbounded variety of human thoughts and perceptions. Talles and finials are almost as numerous as the species of bodies. Sounds admit of perceptible varieties that surpass all computation, and the seven primary colours may be diversified without end. If each variety of external perception were to have a name, language would be insurmountably difficult; nay, if men were to appropriate a class of names to each particular sense, they would multiply words exceedingly, without adding any thing to the clearness of speech. Those words, therefore, that in their proper signification denote the objects of one sense, we often apply tropically to the objects of another, and say, Sweet taste, sweet smell, sweet sound; sharp point, sharp tale, sharp sound; harmony of sounds, harmony of colour, harmony of parts; soft silk, soft colour, soft sound, soft temper; and so in a thousand instances: and yet these words, in their tropical signification, are not less intelligible than in their proper one; for sharp tale and sharp sound, are as expressive as sharp sword; and harmony of tones is not better understood by the musician, than harmony of parts by the architect, and harmony of colours by the painter.\n\nSavages, illiterate persons, and children, have comparatively but few words in proportion to the things they may have occasion to speak of; and must therefore recur to tropes and figures more frequently than persons of copious elocution. A seaman, or mechanic, even when he talks of that which does not belong to his art, borrows his language from that which does; and this makes his diction figurative to a degree that is sometimes entertaining enough. \"Death (says a seaman in one of Smollet's novels) has not yet boarded my comrade; but they have been yard-arm and yard-arm the three glaister. His starboard eye is open, but fast jammed in his head; and the halyards of his under jaw have given way.\" These phrases are exaggerated; but we allow them to be natural, because we know that illiterate people are apt to make use of tropes and figures taken from their own trade, even when they speak of things that are very remote and incongruous. In those poems, therefore, that imitate the conversation of illiterate persons, as in comedy, farce, and pastoral, such figures judiciously\nOf Tropes diciously applied may render the imitation more pleasing, because more exact and natural.\n\nWords that are unmeasurable and harsh, the poet is often obliged to avoid, when perhaps he has no other way to express their meaning than by tropes and figures; and sometimes the measure of his verse may oblige him to reject a proper word that is not harsh, merely on account of its being too long, or too short, or in any other way unfitting to the rhythm, or to the rhyme. And hence another use of figurative language, that it contributes to poetical harmony. Thus, to press the plain, is frequently used to signify to be plain in battle; liquid plain is put for ocean, blue serene for sky, and sylvan reign for country life.\n\n(2.) Tropes and figures are favourable to delicacy. When the proper name of a thing is in any respect unpleasant, a well-chosen trope will convey the idea in such a way as to give no offence. This is agreeable, and even necessary, in polite conversation, and cannot be dispensed with in elegant writing of any kind. Many words, from their being often applied to vulgar use, acquire a meaning that disqualifies them for a place in serious poetry; while perhaps, under the influence of a different system of manners, the corresponding words in another language may be elegant, or at least not vulgar. When one reads Homer in the Greek, one takes no offence at his calling Eumenes by a name which, literally rendered, signifies swine-herd; first, because the Greek word is well-founded in itself; secondly, because we have never heard it pronounced in conversation, nor consequently debased by vulgar use; and, thirdly, because we know, that the office denoted by it was, in the age of Eumenes, both important and honourable. But Pope would have been blamed, if a name so indelicate as swine-herd had in his translation been applied to so eminent a personage; and therefore he judiciously makes use of the trope synecdoche, and calls him swain; a word both elegant and poetical, and not likely to lead the reader into any mistake about the person spoken of, as his employment had been described in a preceding passage. The same Eumenes is said, in the simple but melodious language of the original, to have been making his own shoes when Ulysses came to his door; a work which in those days the greatest heroes would often find necessary. This, too, the translator softens by a topical expression:\n\nHere sat Eumenes, and his cares applied,\nTo form strong byllins of well seasoned hide.\n\nA hundred other examples might be quoted from this translation; but these will explain our meaning.\n\nThere are other occasions on which the delicacy of figurative language is still more needful; as in Virgil's account of the effects of animal love, and of the plague among the beasts, in the third Georgic; where Dryden's style, by being less figurative than the original, is in one place exceedingly filthy, and in another shockingly obscene.\n\nHobbes could confute a Greek author; but his skill in words must have been all derived from the dictionary; for he seems not to have known that any one articulate sound could be more agreeable, or any one phrase more dignified than another. In his Iliad and Odyssy, even when he hits the author's sense (which is not always the case), he proves, by his choice of words, that of harmony, elegance, or energy of style, he had no manner of conception. And hence that work, though called a Translation of Homer, does not even deserve the name of poem; because it is in every respect unpleasing, being nothing more than a fictitious narrative delivered in a mean prose, with the additional means of harsh rhyme and unmeasurable measure.\u2014Trapp understood Virgil well enough as a grammarian, and had a taste for his beauties; yet his translation bears no resemblance to Virgil; which is owing to the same cause, an imprudent choice of words and figures, and a total want of harmony.\n\nThe delicacy we here contend for may, indeed, both which, in conversation and in writing, be carried too far. To call killing an innocent man in a duel an affair of honour, and rid too far a violation of the rights of wedlock an affair of gallantry, is a profanation of figurative language. Nor is it any credit to us, that we are said to have upwards of 40 figurative phrases to express excellent drinking. Language of this sort generally implies, that the public abhorrence of such crimes is not so strong as it ought to be; and it is a question, whether even our morals might not be improved, if we were to call these and such like crimes by their proper names, murder, adultery, drunkenness, gluttony; names that not only express our meaning, but also beget our disapprobation.\u2014As to writing, it cannot be denied, that even Pope himself, in the excellent version just now quoted, has sometimes, for the sake of his numbers, or for fear of giving offence by too close an imitation of Homer's simplicity, employed tropes and figures too quaint or too solemn for the occasion.\n\nAnd the finical style is in part characterized by the writer's dislike to literal expressions, and affectedly substituting in their stead unnecessary tropes and figures. With these authors, a man's only child must always be his only hope; a country maid becomes a rural beauty, or perhaps a nymph of the groves; if flattery sing at all, it must be a syren song; the shepherd's flute dwindles into an oaten reed, and his crook is exalted into a sceptre; the silver lilies rise from their golden beds, and languish to the complaining gale. A young woman, though a good Christian, cannot make herself agreeable without sacrificing to the Graces; nor hope to do any execution among the gentle swains, till a whole legion of Cupids, armed with flames and darts, and other weapons, begin to discharge from her eyes their formidable artillery. For the sake of variety, or of the verse, some of these figures may now and then find a place in a poem; but in prose, unless very sparingly used, they favour of affectation.\n\n(3.) Tropes and figures promote brevity; and brevity, united with perspicuity, is always agreeable. An example or two will be given in the next paragraph. Sentiments thus delivered, and imagery, thus painted, are readily apprehended, by the mind, make a strong impression upon the fancy, and remain long in the memory; whereas too many words, even when the meaning is good, never fail to bring disgust and weariness. They argue a debility of mind which hinders the author from seeing his thoughts in one distinct point of view; and they also encourage a suspicion, that there is something faulty or defective in the matter. In the poetical style, therefore, which is addressed to the fancy and passions, and intended to make a vivid, a pleasing, and a permanent impression, brevity, and consequently tropes and figures, are indispensable. And a language will always be\nOf Tropes be the better suited to poetical purposes, the more it admits of this brevity\u2014a character which is more conspicuous in the Greek and Latin than in any modern tongue, and much less in the French than in the Italian or English.\n\n(4.) Tropes and figures contribute to strength or energy of language, not only by their conciseness, but also by conveying to the fancy ideas that are easily comprehended, and make a strong impression. We are powerfully affected with what we see, or feel, or hear. When a sentiment comes enforced or illustrated by figures taken from objects of sight, or touch, or hearing, one thinks, as it were, that one sees, or feels, or hears, the thing spoken of; and thus, what in itself would perhaps be obscure, or is merely intellectual, may be made to seize our attention and interest our passions almost as effectually as if it were an object of outward sense. When Virgil calls the Scipios thunderbolts of war, he very strongly expresses in one word, and by one image, the rapidity of their victories, the noise their achievements made in the world, and the ruin and consternation that attended their irresistible career.\u2014When Homer calls Ajax the bulwark of the Greeks, he paints with equal brevity his vast size and strength, the difficulty of prevailing against him, and the confidence wherewith his countrymen repose on his valour.\u2014When Solomon says of the strange woman, or harlot, that \u201cher feet go down to death,\u201d he lets us know, not only that her path ends in destruction, but also, that they who accompany her will find it easy to go forwards to ruin, and difficult to return to their duty.\u2014Satan\u2019s enormous magnitude, and resplendent appearance, his perpendicular ascent through a region of darkness, and the inconceivable rapidity of his motion, are all painted out to our fancy by Milton, in one very short similitude,\n\nSprung upward, like\u2014a pyramid of fire.\n\nPar. Lof. iv. 1013.\n\nTo take in the full meaning of which figure, we must imagine ourselves in chaos, and a vast luminous body rising upwards, near the place where we are, so swiftly as to appear a continued track of light, and lessening to the view according to the increase of distance, till it end in a point, and then disappear; and all this must be supposed to strike our eye at one instant.\u2014Equal to this in propriety, though not in magnificence, is that allegory of Gray,\n\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave:\n\nWhich presents to the imagination a wide plain, where several roads appear, crowded with glittering multitudes, and issuing from different quarters, but drawing nearer and nearer as they advance, till they terminate in the dark and narrow house, where all their glories enter in succession, and disappear for ever.\u2014When it is said in Scripture, of a good man who died, that he fell asleep, what a number of ideas are at once conveyed to our imagination, by this beautiful and expressive figure: As a labourer, at the close of day, goes to sleep, with the satisfaction of having performed his work, and with the agreeable hope of awakening in the morning of a new day, refreshed and cheerful; so a good man, at the end of life, resigns himself calm and contented to the will of his Maker, with the sweet reflection of having endeavoured to do his duty, and with the transporting hope of soon awaking in the regions of light, to life and happiness eternal. The figure also suggests, that to a good man the transition from life to death is, even in the sensation, no more painful, than when our faculties melt away into the pleasing insensibility of sleep.\u2014Satan, flying among the stars, is said by Milton to \u201cfall between worlds and worlds;\u201d which has an elegance and force far superior to the proper word fly. For by this allusion to a ship, we are made to form a lively idea of his great size, and to conceive of his motion, that it was equable and majestic.\u2014Virgil uses a happy figure to express the size of the great wooden horse, by means of which the Greeks were conveyed into Troy: \u201cEquum divina Palladis arte adficient.\u201d\u2014Milton is still bolder when he says,\n\nWho would not sing for Lycidas! he knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.\n\nThe phrase, however, though bold, is emphatical; and gives a noble idea of the durability of poetry, as well as of the art and attention requisite to form a good poem.\u2014There are hundreds of tropical expressions in common use, incomparably more energetic than any proper words of equal brevity that could be put in their place. A cheek burning with blushes, is a trope which at once describes the colour as it appears to the beholder, and the glowing heat as it is felt by the person blushing. Chilled with despondency, petrified with astonishment, thunderstruck with disagreeable and unexpected intelligence, melted with love or pity, dissolved in luxury, hardened in wickedness, softened into remorse, inflamed with desire, soiled with uncertainty, &c.\u2014every one is sensible of the force of these and the like phrases, and that they must contribute to the energy of composition.\n\n(5.) Tropes and figures promote strength of expression; and are in poetry peculiarly requisite, because they are often more natural, and more imitative, than proper words. In fact, this is so much the case, that it would be impossible to imitate the language of passion without them. It is true, that when the mind is agitated, one does not run out into allegories, or long-winded similitudes, or any of the figures that require much attention and many words, or that tend to withdraw the fancy from the object of the passion. Yet the language of many passions must be figurative notwithstanding; because they rouse the fancy, and direct it to objects congenial to their own nature, which diversify the language of the speaker with a multitude of allusions. The fancy of a very angry man, for example, prefers to his view a train of disagreeable ideas connected with the passion of anger, and tending to encourage it; and if he speak without restraint during the paroxysm of his rage, those ideas will force themselves upon him, and compel him to give them utterance. \u201cInfernal monster! (he will say),\u2014my blood boils at him; he has used me like a dog; never was man so injured as I have been by this barbarian. He has no more sense of propriety than a stone. His countenance is diabolical, and his soul as ugly as his countenance. His heart is cold and hard, and his resolutions dark and bloody,\u201d &c. This speech is wholly figurative. It is made up of metaphors and hyperboles, which, with the prolepsis and apostrophe, are the most passionate of all the figures. Lear, driven out of doors by his unnatural daughters, in the midst of darkness, thunder, and tempest, naturally\nPart I.\n\nOf Trope rally breaks forth (for his indignation is just now raised and to the very highest pitch) into the following violent exclamation against the crimes of mankind, in which almost every word is figurative:\n\nTremble, thou wretch,\nThat hast within thee undivulged crimes\nUnwhipt of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,\nThou perjur'd, and thou simular of virtue,\nThat art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,\nThat under covert, and convenient seeming,\nHalf practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,\nRive your concealing continents, and cry\nThese dreadful summoners grace. King Lear.\n\nThe vehemence of maternal love, and sorrow from the apprehension of losing her child, make the Lady Constance utter a language that is strongly figurative, though quite suitable to the condition and character of the speaker. The passage is too long for a quotation, but concludes thus:\n\nO Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son,\nMy life, my joy, my food, my all the world,\nMy widow-comfort, and my sorrow's cure. King John.\n\nSimilar to this, and equally expressive of conjugal love, is that beautiful hyperbole in Homer; where Andromache, to dissuade her husband from going out to the battle, tells him that she had now no mother, father, or brethren, all her kindred being dead, and her native country desolate; and then tenderly adds,\n\nBut while my Hector yet survives, I see\nMy father, mother, brethren, all in thee. Iliad, b. vi.\n\nAs the passions that agitate the soul, and rouse the fancy, are apt to vent themselves in tropes and figures, so those that depress the mind adopt for the most part a plain diction without any ornament: for to a dejected mind, wherein the imagination is generally inactive, it is not probable that any great variety of ideas will present themselves; and when these are few and familiar, the words that express them must be simple. As no author equals Shakespeare in boldness or variety of figures when he copies the style of those violent passions that stimulate the fancy; so, when he would exhibit the human mind in a dejected state, no uninspired writer excels him in simplicity. The same Lear whose resentment had impaired his understanding, while it broke out in the most boisterous language, when, after some medical applications, he recovers his reason, his rage being now exhausted, his pride humbled, and his spirits totally depressed, speaks in a style than which nothing can be imagined more simple or more affecting.\n\nPray, do not mock me:\nI am a very foolish, fond old man;\nFourscore and upward; and, to deal plainly with you,\nI fear I am not in my perfect mind.\nMethinks I should know you, and know this man;\nYet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant\nWhat place this is; and all the skill I have\nRemembers not these garments: nor I know not\nWhere I did lodge last night. Lear, Act iv. sc. 7.\n\n\u2014Desdemona, ever gentle, artless, and sincere, shocked at the unkindness of her husband, and overcome with melancholy, speaks in a style so beautifully simple, and so perfectly natural, that one knows not what to say in commendation of it:\n\nMy mother had a maid call'd Barbara;\nShe was in love, and he she lov'd prov'd false,\nAnd did forlike her. She had a long of willow;\nAn old thing it was, but it exprest her fortune,\nAnd the died fingering it. That long to-night\nWill not go from my mind: I have much to do,\nBut to go hang my head all at one side,\nAnd sing it like poor Barbara, Othello, Act iv. sc. 3.\n\nSometimes the imagination, even when exerted to the utmost, takes in but few ideas. This happens when the attention is totally engrossed by some very great object; admiration being one of those emotions that rather suspend the exercise of the faculties than push them into action. And here, too, the simplest language is the most natural; as when Milton says of the Deity, that he sits \"high-throned above all height.\" And as to the this simplicity is more suitable to that one great exertion of sentiment which occupies the speaker's mind than a more elaborate imagery or language would have been, so has it also a more powerful effect in fixing and elevating the imagination of the hearer; for to introduce other thoughts for the sake of illustrating what cannot be illustrated, could answer no other purpose than to draw off the attention from the principal idea. In these and the like cases, the fancy left to itself will have more satisfaction in pursuing at leisure its own speculations than in attending to those of others; as they who see for the first time some admirable object would choose rather to feast upon it in silence, than to have their thoughts interrupted by a long description from another person, informing them of nothing but what they see before them, are already acquainted with, or may easily conceive.\n\nIt was remarked above that the hyperbole, presopoeia, and apophthegm, are among the most passionate figures. This deserves illustration.\n\n1st, A very angry man is apt to think the injury he has just received greater than it really is; and if he proceed immediately to retaliate by word or deed, seldom fails to exceed the due bounds, and to become injurious love, fear, in his turn. The fond parent looks upon his child as a prodigy of genius and beauty; and the romantic lover will not be persuaded that his mistress has nothing supernatural either in her mind or person. Fear, in like manner, not only magnifies its object when real, but even forms an object out of nothing, and mistakes the fictions of fancy for the intimations of sense.\u2014No wonder, then, that they who speak according to the impulse of passion should speak hyperbolically; that the angry man should exaggerate the injury he has received, and the vengeance he is going to inflict; that the sorrowful should magnify what they have lost, and the joyful what they have obtained; that the lover should speak extravagantly of the beauty of his mistress, the coward of the dangers he has encountered, and the credulous clown of the miracles performed by the juggler. In fact, these people would not do justice to what they feel if they did not say more than the truth. The valiant man, on the other hand, as naturally adopts the diminishing hyperbole when he speaks of danger; and the man of sense, when he is obliged to mention his own virtue or ability; because it appears to him, or he is willing to consider.\nOf Tropes consider it, as less than the truth, or at best as inconsiderable. Contempt uses the same figure; and therefore Petruchio, affecting that passion, affects also the language of it:\n\nThou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,\nThou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,\nThou fleas, thou nit, thou winter-cricket, thou!\nBrav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!\nAway, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant!\n\n*Taming of the Shrew*, Act iv. sc. 1.\n\nFor some passions consider their objects as important, and others as unimportant. Of the former sort are anger, love, fear, admiration, joy, sorrow, pride; of the latter are contempt and courage. Those may be said to subdue the mind to the object, and these to subdue the object to the mind. And the former, when violent, always magnify their objects; whence the hyperbole called amplification, or *aixefia*; and the latter as constantly diminish theirs; and give rise to the hyperbole called *meifia*, or diminution.\u2014Even when the mind cannot be said to be under the influence of any violent passion, we naturally employ the same figure when we would impress another very strongly with any idea. \"He is a walking shadow; he is worn to skin and bone; he has one foot in the grave and the other following;\"\u2014these, and the like phrases, are proved to be natural by their frequency. By introducing great ideas, the hyperbole is further useful in poetry as a source of the sublime; but when employed injudiciously is very apt to become ridiculous. Cowley makes Goliath as big as us.\n\n*Daviddeit*, the hill down which he was marching*; and tells us, that when he came into the valley he seemed to fill it, and to overtop the neighbouring mountains (which, by the by, seems rather to lessen the mountains and valleys than to magnify the giant); nay, he adds, that the sun started back when he saw the splendour of his arms. This poet seems to have thought that the figure in question could never be sufficiently enormous; but Quintilian would have taught him, \"Quamvis omnis hyperbole ultra fidem, non tamen effe debet ultra modum.\"\n\nThe reason is, that this figure, when excessive, betokens rather absolute infatuation than intense emotion; and resembles the efforts of a ranting tragedian, or the ravings of an enthusiastic declaimer, who, by putting on the gestures and looks of a lunatic, satisfy the discerning part of their audience, that, instead of feeling strongly, they have no rational feelings at all. In the wildest energies of nature there is a modesty which the imitative artist will be careful never to overstep.\n\n2dly, That figure, by which things are spoken of as if they were persons, is called *protopoecia*, or personification. It is a bold figure, and yet is often natural. Long acquaintance recommends to some share in our affection even things inanimate, as a house, a tree, a rock, a mountain, a country; and were we to hear such a thing without hope of return, we should be inclined to address it with a farewell, as if it were a percipient creature. Hence it was that Mary queen of Scotland, when on her return to her own kingdom, so affectionately bade adieu to the country which she had left. \"Farewell France,\" said she; \"farewell, beloved country, which I shall never more behold!\" Nay, we find that ignorant names have actually worshipped such things, or considered them as the haunt of certain powerful beings. Dryads and hamadryads were by the Greeks and Romans supposed to preside over trees and groves; river gods and nymphs, over streams and fountains; little deities, called *Lares* and *Penates*, were believed to be the guardians of hearths and houses. In Scotland there is hardly a hill remarkable for the beauty of its shape, that was not in former times thought to be the habitation of fairies. Nay, modern as well as ancient superstition has appropriated the waters to a peculiar sort of demon or goblin, and people the very regions of death, the tombs and charnel-houses, with multitudes of ghosts and phantoms.\u2014Besides, when things inanimate make a strong impression upon us, whether agreeable or otherwise, we are apt to address them in terms of affection or dislike. The sailor blesses the plank that brought him ashore from the shipwreck; and the paffionate man, and sometimes even the philosopher, will say bitter words to the stumbling block that gave him a fall.\u2014Moreover, a man agitated with any interesting passion, especially of long continuance, is apt to fancy that all nature sympathizes with him. If he has lost a beloved friend, he thinks the sun lies brighter than at other times; and in the sighing of the winds and groves, in the lowings of the herd, and in the murmurs of the stream, he seems to hear the voice of lamentation. But when joy or hope predominate, the whole world assumes a gay appearance. In the contemplation of every part of nature, of every condition of mankind, of every form of human society, the benevolent and the pious man, the morose and the cheerful, the miser and the philanthrope, finds occasion to indulge his favourite passion, and fees, or thinks he fees, his own temper reflected back in the actions, sympathies, and tendencies of other things and persons. Our affections are indeed the medium through which we may be said to survey ourselves, and everything else; and whatever be our inward frame, we are apt to perceive a wonderful congeniality in the world without us. And hence the fancy, when roused by real emotions, or by the pathos of composition, is easily reconciled to those figures of speech that ascribe sympathy, perception, and the other attributes of animal life, to things inanimate, or even to notions merely intellectual.\n\nMotion, too, bears a close affinity to action, and affects our imagination nearly in the same manner; and we see a great part of nature in motion, and by its sensible effects are led to contemplate energies innumerable. These conduct the rational mind to the Great First Cause; and these, in times of ignorance, duped the vulgar to believe in a variety of subordinate agents employed in producing those appearances that could not otherwise be accounted for. Hence an endless train of fabulous deities, and of witches, demons, fairies, genii; which, if they prove our reason weak and our fancy strong, prove also that personification is natural to the human mind; and that a right use of this figure may have a powerful effect, in fabulous writing especially, to engage our sympathy in behalf of things as well as persons: for nothing can give lasting delight to a moral being, but that which awakens sympathy, and touches the heart; and though it be true that we sympathize in some degree even with inanimate things, yet what has, or is supposed to have, life, calls forth a more sincere and more permanent fellow-feeling.\u2014Let it be observed further, that to awaken such sympathetic feelings, a lively conception of their object is necessary. This indeed is true of almost all our emotions; their keenness is in proportion\nportion to the vivacity of the perceptions that excite them. Distress that we feel is more affecting than what we only hear of; a perusal of the gayest scenes in a comedy does not rouse the mind so effectually as the presence of a cheerful companion; and the death of a friend is of greater energy in producing ferociousness, and the consideration of our latter end, than all the pathos of Young.\n\nOf descriptions addressed to the fancy, those that are most vivid and picturesque will generally be found to have the most powerful influence over our affections; and those that exhibit persons engaged in action, and adorned with visible insignia, give a brisker impulse to the faculties than such as convey intellectual ideas only, or images taken from still life. No abstraction notion of time, or of love, can be so striking to the fancy as the image of an old man accoutred with a scythe, or of a beautiful boy with wings and a bow and arrows: and no physiological account of frenzy could suggest so vivid an idea as the poet has given us in that exquisite portrait,\n\nAnd moody madness laughing wild amid feverest wo.\n\nAnd for this reason partly it is that the epic poet, in order to work the more effectually upon our passions and imagination, refers the secret springs of human conduct, and the vicissitudes of human affairs, to the agency of personified causes; that is, to the machinery of gods and goddesses, angels, demons, magicians, and other powerful beings. And hence, in all sublime poetry, life and motion, with their several modes and attributes, are liberally bestowed on those objects wherewith the author intends that we should be strongly impressed: scenes perfectly inanimate and still, tending rather to diffuse a languor over the mind than to communicate to our internal powers those lively energies without which a being essentially active can never receive complete gratification.\n\nLastly, some violent passions are peculiarly inclined to change things into persons. The horrors of his mind haunted Orestes in the shape of furies. Conscience, in the form of the murdered person, stares the murderer in the face, and often terrifies him to distraction. The superstitious man, travelling alone in the dark, mistakes a white stone for a ghost, a bush for a demon, a tree waving with the wind for an enormous giant brandishing a hundred arms. The lunatic and enthusiast converse with persons who exist only in their own distempered fancy; and the glutton and the miser, if they were to give utterance to all their thoughts, would often, it is probable, speak, the one of his gold, the other of his belly, not only as a person, but as a god,\u2014the object of his warmest love and most devout regard.\u2014More need not be said to prove that personification is natural, and may frequently contribute to the pathos, energy, and beauty of poetic language.\n\nApotrophe, or a sudden diversion of speech from one person to another person or thing, is a figure nearly related to the former. Poets sometimes make use of it, in order to help out their verse, or merely to give variety to their style: but on these occasions it is to be considered as rather a trick of art, than an effort of nature. It is most natural, and most pathetic, when the person or thing to whom the apotrophe is made, and for whose sake we give a new direction to our speech, is in our eyes eminently distinguished for good or evil, or raises within us some sudden and powerful emotion, such as the hearer would acquiesce in, or at least acknowledge to be reasonable. But this, like the other pathetic figures, must be used with great prudence. For if, instead of calling forth the hearer's sympathy, it should only betray the levity of the speaker, or such wanderings of his mind as neither the subject nor the occasion would lead one to expect, it will then create disgust instead of approbation. The orator, therefore, must not attempt the passionate apostrophe, till the minds of the hearers be prepared to join in it. And every audience is not equally obsequious in this respect. In the forum of ancient Rome that would have passed for sublime and pathetic, which in the most respectable British auditoriums would appear ridiculous. For our style of public speaking is cool and argumentative; and partakes less of enthusiasm than the Roman did, and much less than the modern French or Italian. Of British eloquence, particularly that of the pulpit, the chief recommendations are gravity and simplicity. And it is vain to say, that our oratory ought to be more vehement; for that matter depends on causes, which it is not only inexpedient, but impossible to alter; namely, on the character and spirit of the people, and their rational notions in regard to religion, policy, and literature. The exclamations of Cicero would weigh but little in our parliament; and many of those which we meet with in French sermons would not be more effectual if attempted in our pulpit. To see one of our preachers, who the moment before was a cool reasoner, a temperate speaker, an humble Christian, and an orthodox divine, break out into a sudden apostrophe to the immortal powers, or to the walls of the church, tends to force a smile, rather than a tear, from those among us who reflect, that there is nothing in the subject, and should be nothing in the orator, to warrant such wanderings of fancy or vehemence of emotion. If he be careful to cultivate a pure style, and a grave and graceful utterance, a British clergyman, who speaks from conviction the plain unaffected words of truth and soberness, of benevolence and piety, will, it is believed, convey more pathetic, as well as more permanent, impressions to the heart, and be more useful as a Christian teacher, than if he were to put in practice all the attitudes of Roscius, and all the tropes and figures of Cicero.\n\nBut where the language of passion and enthusiasm is permitted to display itself, whatever raises any strong emotion, whether it be animated or inanimate, absent or present, sensible or intellectual, may give rise to the apostrophe. A man in a distant country, speaking of the place of his birth, might naturally exclaim, \"O my dear native land, shall I never see thee more!\" Or, when some great misfortune befalls him, \"Happy are ye, O my parents, that ye are not alive to see this.\" We have a beautiful apostrophe in the third book of the \u00c6neid, where \u00c6neas, who is telling his story to Dido, happening to mention the death of his father, makes a sudden address to him as follows:\n\nhic, pelagi tot tempestatibus agas,\nHeu, genitorem, omnis curae causique levamen,\nAmitto Anchilien:\u2014hic me, pater optime, fellum\nDeferis, heu, tantis nequiquam crepte periculis!\n\nThis apostrophe has a pleasing effect. It seems to intimate, that the love which the hero bore his father was so great, that when he mentioned him he forgot every thing\nthing else; and, without minding his company, one of whom was a queen, suddenly addressed himself to that which, though present only in idea, was still a principal object of his affection. An emotion so warm and so reasonable cannot fail to command the sympathy of the reader.\u2014When Michael, in the eleventh book of Paradise Lost, announces to Adam and Eve the necessity of their immediate departure from the garden of Eden, the poet's art in preserving the decorum of the two characters is very remarkable. Pierced to the heart at the thought of leaving that happy place, Eve, in all the violence of ungovernable sorrow, breaks forth into a pathetic apostrophe to Paradise, to the flowers she had reared, and to the nuptial bower she had adorned. Adam makes no address to the walks, the trees, or the flowers of the garden, the lofs whereof did not so much afflict him; but, in his reply to the Archangel, expresses, without a figure, his regret for being banished from a place where he had been so often honoured with a sensible manifestation of the divine presence. The use of the apostrophe in the one case, and the omission of it in the other, not only gives a beautiful variety to the style, but also marks that superior elevation and composure of mind, by which the poet had all along distinguished the character of Adam.\u2014One of the finest applications of this figure that is anywhere to be seen, is in the fourth book of the same poem; where the author, catching by sympathy the devotion of our first parents, suddenly drops his narrative, and joins his voice to theirs in adoring the Father of the universe.\n\nThus at their shady lodge arriv'd, both flood,\nBoth turn'd, and under open sky ador'd\nThe God that made both sky, air, earth, and heav'n,\nWhich they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,\nAnd starry pole:\u2014Thou also mad'it the night,\nMaker omnipotent! and thou the day,\nWhich we in our appointed work employ'd\nHave finish'd.\n\nMilton took the hint of this fine contrivance from a well-known passage of Virgil:\n\nHic juvenum chorus, ille fenum; qui carmine laudes\nHercules et facta ferant;\nut duros mille labores\nRege sub Eurytseo, fatis Junonis inique,\nFertulerit:\u2014Tu nubigenas, invicte, bismembr\u00e6,\nHylaeumque, Pholumque manu, tu Crehae maetas\nProdigia.\n\nThe beauty arising from diversified composition is the same in both, and very great in each. But every reader must feel, that the figure is incomparably more affecting to the mind in the imitation than in the original. So true it is, that the most rational emotions raise the most intense fellow-feeling; and that the apostrophe is then the most emphatical, when it displays those workings of human affection which are at once ardent and well-founded.\n\nTo conclude this head: Tropes and figures, particularly the metaphor, similitude, and allegory, are further useful in beautifying language, by suggesting, together with the thoughts essential to the subject, an endless variety of agreeable images, for which there would be no place, if writers were always to confine themselves to the proper names of things. And this beauty and variety, judiciously applied, is so far from distracting, that it tends rather to fix the attention, and captivate the heart of the readers, by giving light, and life, and pathos, to the whole composition.\n\nII. That tropes and figures are more necessary to poetry, than to any other mode of writing, was the second point proposed to be illustrated in this section.\n\nLanguage, as already observed, is then natural, when Tropes and it is suitable to the supposed condition of the speaker. Figurative language is peculiarly suitable to the supposed condition of the poet; because figures are suggested by the fancy; and the fancy of him who composes poetry is more employed than that of any other author. Of all historical, philosophical, and theological researches, the object is real truth, which is fixed and permanent. The aim of rhetorical declamation (according to Cicero) is apparent truth; which, being less determinate, leaves the fancy of the speaker more free, gives greater scope to the inventive powers, and supplies the materials of a more figurative phraseology. But the poet is subject to no restraints, but those of verisimilitude; which is still less determinate than rhetorical truth. He seeks not to convince the judgment of his reader by arguments of either real or apparent cogency; he means only to please and interest him, by an appeal to his sensibility and imagination. His own imagination is therefore continually at work, ranging through the whole of real and probable existence, \"glancing from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,\" in quest of images and ideas suited to the emotions he himself feels, and to the sympathies he would communicate to others. And, consequently, figures of speech, the offspring of excursive fancy, must (if he speak according to what he is supposed to think and feel, that is, according to his supposed condition) tincture the language of the poet more than that of any other composer. So that, if figurative diction be unnatural in geometry, because all wanderings of fancy are unsuitable, and even impossible, to the geometrician, while intent upon his argument; it is, upon the same principle, perfectly natural, and even unavoidable, in poetry; because the more a poet attends to his subject, and the better qualified he is to do it justice, the more active will his imagination be, and the more diversified the ideas that present themselves to his mind.\u2014Besides, the true poet addresses himself to the passions and sympathies of mankind; which, till his own be raised, he cannot hope to do with success. And it is the nature of many passions, though not of all, to increase the activity of imagination: and an active imagination naturally vents itself in figurative language; nay, unless restrained by a correct taste, has a tendency to exceed in it; of which Bishop Taylor and Lord Verulam, two geniuses different in kind, but of the highest order, are memorable examples.\n\nWe said, that \"the poet seeks not to convince the judgment of his reader by arguments of either real or apparent cogency.\"\u2014We do not mean, that in poetry argument has no place. The most legitimate reasoning, the profoundest philosophy, and narratives purely historical, may appear in a poem, and contribute greatly to the honour of the author, and to the importance of his work. All this we have in Paradise Lost. We mean, that what distinguishes pure poetry from other writing, is its aptitude, not to sway the judgment by reasoning,\nOf poetical foning, but to please the fancy, and move the passions, by Harmony.\na lively imitation of nature. Nor would we exclude poet-\nical embellishment from history, or even from philosophy.\nPlato's Dialogues and the Moral Essays of Addison\nand Johnson abound in poetical imagery; and Livy and Tacitus often amuse their readers with poetical descrip-\ntion. In like manner, though geometry and physics be\ndifferent sciences; though abstract ideas be the subject,\nand pure demonstration or intuition the evidence, of the\nformer; and though the material universe, and the im-\nformations of sense, be the subject and the evidence of\nthe latter; yet have these sciences been united by the\nbest philosophers, and very happy effects resulted from\nthe union.\u2014In one and the same work, poetry, histo-\nry, philosophy, and oratory, may doubtless be blended;\nnay, these arts have all been actually blended in one and\nthe same work, not by Milton only, but also by Ho-\nmer, Virgil, Lucan, and Shakespeare. Yet still these\narts are different; different in their ends and principles,\nand in the faculties of the mind to which they are re-\nspectively addressed: and it is easy to perceive when a\nwriter employs one and when another.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of the SOUND of Poetical Language.\n\nAs the ear, like every other perceptive faculty, is\ncapable of gratification, regard is to be had to the found\nof words, even in prose. But to the harmony of lan-\nguage, it behoves the poet, more than any other writer,\nto attend; as it is more especially his concern to render\nhis work pleasurable. In fact, we find, that no poet was\never popular who did not possess the art of harmonious\ncomposition.\n\nWhat belongs to the subject of Poetical Harmony\nmay be referred to one or other of these heads, Sweet-\nness, Measure, and Imitation.\n\nI. In order to give sweetness to language, either in\nverse or prose, all words of harsh sound, difficult pro-\nnunciation, or unwieldy magnitude, are to be avoided as\nmuch as possible, unless when they have in the sound\nsomething peculiarly emphatic; and words are to be so\nplaced in respect of one another, as that discordant\ncombinations may not result from their union. But in\npoetry this is more necessary than in prose; poetical\nlanguage being understood to be an imitation of natural\nlanguage improved to that perfection which is consistent\nwith probability. To poetry, therefore, a greater lati-\ntude must be allowed than to prose, in expressing, by\ntropes and figures of pleasing sound, those ideas whereof\nthe proper names are in any respect offensive, either to\nthe ear or to the fancy.\n\nII. How far verification or regular measure may be\nessential to this art, has been disputed by critical writers;\nsome holding it to be indispensible necessary, and some\nnot necessary at all.\n\nThe fact seems to be, as already hinted, that to poe-\ntry verse is not essential. In a prose work, we may\nhave the fable, the arrangement, and a great deal of the\npathos and language, of poetry; and such a work is cer-\ntainly a poem, though perhaps not a perfect one. For\nhow absurd would it be to say, that by changing the\nposition only of a word or two in each line, one might\ndivest Homer's Iliad of its poetical character! At this\nrate, the arts of poetry and verification would be the\nsame; and the rules in Defrater's Grammar, and the\nmoral duties ascribed to Cato, would be as real poetry\nas any part of Virgil. In fact, some very ancient poems,\nwhen translated into a modern tongue, are far less poet-\nical in verse than in prose; the alterations necessary to\nadapt them to our numbers being detrimental to their\nsublime simplicity; of which any person of taste will be\nsensible, who compares our common prose version of\nJob, the Psalms, and the Song of Solomon, with the\nbest metrical paraphrase of those books that has yet ap-\npeared. Nay, in many cases, Comedy will be more\npoetical, because more pleasing and natural, in prose\nthan in verse. By verifying Tom Jones, and The\nMerry Wives of Windsor, we should spoil the two finest\ncomic poems, the one epic, the other dramatical, now in\nthe world.\n\nBut, secondly, though verse be not essential to poetry, adds\nit is necessary to the perfection of all poetry that admits the perfe-\ntion of it. Verse is to poetry, what colours are to paint-\ning (c). A painter might display great genius, and\ndraw masterly figures with chalk or ink; but if he in-\ntend a perfect picture, he must employ in his work as\nmany colours as are seen in the object he imitates. Or,\nto adopt a beautiful comparison of Demosthenes, quoted\nby Aristotle*, \"Verification is to poetry what bloom is to\nthe human countenance.\" A good face is agreeable\nwhen the bloom is gone, and good poetry may capri-\ncious without verification; harmonious numbers may\nlet off an indifferent poem, and a fine bloom indifferent\nfeatures: but, without verse, poetry is incomplete; and\nbeauty is not perfect, unless sweetness and regularity\nof feature there be superadded.\n\nThe bloom of young desire, and purple light of love.\n\nIf numbers be necessary to the perfection of the higher\npoetry, they are no less so to that of the lower kinds, to\nPastoral, Song, and Satire, which have little besides the\nlanguage and verification to distinguish them from prose;\nand which some ancient authors are unwilling to admit to\nthe rank of poems: though it seems too nice a scruple,\nboth because such writings are commonly termed poet-\nical; and also because there is, even in them, something\nthat may not improperly be considered as an imitation of\nnature.\n\nThat the rhythm and measure of verse are naturally\nagreeable, and therefore that by these poetry may be\nmade more pleasing than it would be without them, is\nevident from this, that children and illiterate people,\nwhose admiration we cannot suppose to be the effect of\nhabit or prejudice, are exceedingly delighted with them.\nIn many proverbial sayings, where there is neither rhyme\nnor alliteration, rhythm is obviously studied. Nay, the\nuse of rhythm in poetry is universal; whereas alliteration\n\n(c) Horace seems to hint at the same comparison, when, after specifying the several sorts of verse suitable to\nEpic, Elegiac, Lyric, and Dramatic Poetry, he adds,\n\nDefcriptas servare vices, operumque colores.\nCur ego, si nequeo ignoroque, Poeta salutor?\nAr. Poet. ver. 86.\nOf poetical and rhyme, though relished by some nations, are not much sought after by others. And we need not be at a loss to account for the agreeableness of proportion and order, if we reflect, that they suggest the agreeable ideas of contrivance and skill, at the same time that they render the connection of things obvious to the understanding, and imprint it deeply on the memory. Verse, by promoting distinct and easy remembrance, conveys ideas to the mind with energy, and enlivens every emotion the poet intends to raise in the reader or hearer. Besides, when we attend to verses, after hearing one or two, we become acquainted with the measure, which, therefore, we always look for in the sequel. This perpetual interchange of hope and gratification is a source of delight; and to this in part is owing the pleasure we take in the rhymes of modern poetry. And hence we see, that though an incorrect rhyme or untuneable verse be in itself, and compared with an important sentiment, a very trifling matter; yet it is no trifle in regard to its effects on the hearer; because it brings disappointment, and so gives a temporary shock to the mind, and interrupts the current of the affections; and because it suggests the disagreeable ideas of negligence or want of skill on the part of the author. And therefore, as the public ear becomes more delicate, the negligence will be more glaring, and the disappointment more intensely felt; and correctness of rhyme and of measure will of course be the more indispensible. In our tongue, rhyme is more necessary to Lyric than to Heroic poetry. The reason seems to be, that in the latter the ear can of itself perceive the boundary of the measure, because the lines are all of equal length nearly, and every good reader makes a short pause at the end of each; whereas, in the former, the lines vary in length; and therefore the rhyme is requisite to make the measure and rhythm sufficiently perceptible. Custom too may have some influence. English Odes without rhyme are uncommon; and therefore have something awkward about them, or something at least to which the public ear is not yet thoroughly reconciled. Indeed, when the drama is excepted, we do not think that rhyme can be safely spared from English poetry of any kind, but when the subject is able to support itself. \"He that thinks himself capable of astonishing (says Johnson) may write blank verse; but those that hope only to please, must confine themselves to rhyme.\"\n\nRhyme, however, is of less importance by far than rhythm, which in poetry as well as in music is the source of much pleasing variety; of variety tempered with uniformity, and regulated by art; insomuch that, notwithstanding the likeness of one hexameter verse to another, it is not common, either in Virgil or Homer, to meet with two contiguous hexameters whose rhythm is exactly the same. And though all English heroic verses consist of five feet, among which the iambic predominates; yet this measure, in respect of rhythm alone, is susceptible of more than 30 varieties. And let it be remarked further, that different kinds of verse, by being adapted to different subjects and modes of writing, give variety to the poetic language, and multiply the charms of this pleasing art.\n\nWhat has formerly been shown to be true in regard to style, will also in many cases hold true of versification, \"that it is then natural when it is adapted to the supposed condition of the speaker.\"\u2014In the epopee the poet assumes the character of calm inspiration; and therefore his language must be elevated, and his numbers majestic and uniform. A peasant speaking in heroic or hexameter verse is no improbability here; but the language of the who will of his own accord give them every ornament necessary to reduce them into dignified measure; as an eloquent man, in a solemn assembly, recapitulating the speech of a clown, would naturally express it in pure uniformly and perspicuous language. The uniform heroic measure will suit any subject of dignity, whether narrative or didactic, that admits or requires uniformity of style. In tragedy, where the imitation of real life is more perfect than in epic poetry, the uniform magnificence of epic numbers might be improper; because the heroes and heroines are supposed to speak in their own persons, and according to the immediate impulse of passion and sentiment. Yet, even in tragedy, the versification may be both harmonious and dignified; because the same characters are taken chiefly from high life, and the uniform events from a remote period; and because the higher cence poetry is permitted to imitate nature, not as it is, but would be in that state of perfection in which it might be. The improper, Greeks and Romans considered their hexameter as too artificial for dramatic poetry; and therefore in tragedy, and even in comedy, made use of the iambic, and some other measures that came near the cadence of conversation: we use the iambic both in the epic and dramatic poem; but for the most part it is, or ought to be, much more elaborate in the former than in the latter. In dramatic comedy, where the manners and concerns of familiar life are exhibited, verse would seem to be unnatural, except it be so like the sound of common discourse as to be hardly distinguishable from it. Custom, however, may in some countries determine otherwise; and against custom, in these matters, it is vain to argue. The professed enthusiasm of the dithyrambic poet renders wildness, variety, and a sonorous harmony of numbers, peculiarly suitable to his odes. The love-sonnet, and Anacreontic song, will be less various, more regular, and of a softer harmony; because the state of mind expressed in it has more composure. Philosophy can scarce go farther in this investigation, without deviating into whims and hypothesis. The particular sorts of verse to be adopted in the lower species of poetry, are determined by fashion chiefly, and the practice of approved authors.\n\nIII. The origin and principles of imitative harmony, or that artifice by which the sound is made, as Pope says, \"an echo to the sense,\" may be explained in the following manner.\n\nIt is pleasing to observe the uniformity of nature in all her operations. Between moral and material beauty and harmony, between moral and material deformity and dissonance, there obtains a very striking analogy. The visible and audible expressions of almost every virtuous emotion are agreeable to the eye and the ear, and those of almost every criminal passion disagreeable. The looks, the attitudes, and the vocal sounds, natural to benevolence, to gratitude, to compassion, to piety, are in themselves graceful and pleasing; while anger, discontent, despair, and cruelty, bring discord to the voice, deformity to the features, and distortion to the limbs. That flowing curve, which painters know to be essential to the beauty of animal shape, gives place to a multiplicity\nOf poetical simplicity of right lines and sharp angles in the countenance and gesture of him who knits his brows, stretches his nostrils, grinds his teeth, and clenches his fist; whereas, devotion, magnanimity, benevolence, contentment, and good-humour, soften the attitude, and give a more graceful swell to the outline of every feature. Certain vocal tones accompany certain mental emotions. The voice of sorrow is feeble and broken, that of despair boisterous and incoherent; joy affumes a sweet and sprightly note, fear a weak and tremulous cadence; the tones of love and benevolence are musical and uniform, those of rage loud and dissonant; the voice of the sedate reasoner is equable and grave, but not unpleasing; and he who declaims with energy, employs many varieties of modulation suited to the various emotions that predominate in his discourse.\n\nBut it is not in the language of passion only that the human voice varies its tone, or the human face its features. Every striking sentiment, and every interesting idea, has an effect upon it. One would esteem that person no adept in narrative eloquence, who should describe, with the very same accent, swift and slow motion, extreme labour and easy performance, agreeable sensation and excruciating pain; who should talk of the tumult of a tempestuous ocean, the roar of thunder, the devastations of an earthquake, or an Egyptian pyramid tumbling into ruins, in the same tone of voice wherein he describes the murmur of a rill, the warbling of the harp of \u00c6olus, the swinging of a cradle, or the descent of an angel. Elevation of mind gives dignity to the voice. From Achilles, Sarpedon, and Othello, we should as naturally expect a manly and forcible accent, as a nervous style and majestic attitude. Coxcombs and bullies, while they affume airs of importance and valour, affect also a dignified articulation.\n\nSince the tones of natural language are so various, poetry, which imitates the language of nature, must allow its tones; and, in respect of sound as well as meaning, be framed after that model of ideal perfection, which the variety and energy of the human articulate voice render probable. This is the more easily accomplished, because in every language there is between the sound and sense of certain words a perceptible analogy; which, though not so accurate as to lead a foreigner from the sound to the signification, is yet accurate enough to show, that, in forming such words, regard has been had to the imitative qualities of vocal sound. Such, in English, are the words yell, crash, crack, hiss, roar, murmur, and many others.\n\nAll the particular laws that regulate this sort of imitation, as far as they are founded in nature, and liable to the cognizance of philosophy, depend on the general law of style above mentioned. Together with the other circumstances of the supposed speaker, the poet takes into consideration the tone of voice suitable to the ideas that occupy his mind, and thereto adapts the sound of his language, if it can be done consistently with ease and elegance of expression. But when this imitative harmony is too much sought after, or words appear to be chosen for sound rather than sense, the verse becomes finical and ridiculous. Such is Ronfard's affected imitation of the song of the fly-lark:\n\nElle quind\u00e9e du zephyre\nSublime en l'air vire et revire,\nEt y d\u00e9clique un joli cris,\nQui rit, gu\u00e9rit, et tire l'ire\nDes esprits mieux que je n'\u00e9cris.\n\nThis is as ridiculous as that line of Ennius,\n\nTum tuba terribili sonitu tarantanta dixit:\n\nOr as the following verses of Swift;\n\nThe man with the kettle-drum enters the gate,\nDub dub a dub dub: the trumpeters follow,\nTaranta taranta; while all the boys hollow.\n\nWords by their sound may imitate sound; and quick or slow articulation may imitate quick or slow motion. Hence, by a proper choice and arrangement of words, the poet may imitate Sounds that are sweet with dignity (H),\u2014sweet and tender (I),\u2014loud (K),\u2014and harsh (L);\u2014and Motions that are slow, in consequence of dignity (M),\u2014flow in consequence of difficulty (N),\u2014swift.\n\nSee also the storm in the first book of the \u00c6neid, and in the fifth of the Odyssey.\n\nThe hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar.\n\nOn a sudden open fly,\nWith impetuous recoil and jarring sound,\nTh' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate\nHarsh thunder.\n\nSee also Homer's Iliad, lib. ii. ver. 363, and Clarke's Annotation.\n\nSee an exquisite example in Gray's Progress of Poetry; the conclusion of the third stanza.\n\nAnd when up ten steep slopes you've dragged your thighs.\n\nJust brought out this, when scarce his tongue could stir.\n\nThe huge leviathan\nWallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,\nTempest the ocean.\n\nPar. Loft, vii. 411.\nOf poetical swift and noisy (o)\u2014swift and smooth (p)\u2014uneven and abrupt (q),\u2014quick and joyous (r). An unexpected pause in the verse may also imitate a sudden failure of strength (s), or interruption of motion (t), or give vivacity to an image or thought, by fixing our attention longer than usual upon the word that precedes it (u).\u2014Moreover, when we describe great bulk, it is natural for us to articulate slowly, even in common discourse; and therefore a line of poetry that requires a slow pronunciation, or seems longer than it should be, may be used with good effect in describing vastness of size (x).\u2014Sweet and smooth numbers are most proper, when the poet paints agreeable objects, or gentle energy (y); and harsher sounds when he speaks of what is ugly, violent, or disagreeable (z). This too is according to the nature of common language; for we generally employ harsher tones of voice to express what we dislike, and more melodious notes to describe the objects of love, complacency, or admiration. Harsh numbers, however, should not be frequent in poetry: for in this art, as in music, concord and melody ought always to predominate. And we find in fact, that good poets can occasionally express themselves somewhat harshly, when the subject requires it, and yet preserve the sweetness and majesty of poetical diction. Further, the voice of complaint, pity, love, and all the gentler affections, is mild and musical, and should therefore be imitated in musical numbers; while despair, defiance, revenge, and turbulent emotions in general, assume an abrupt and sonorous cadence.

Virgil, describing horses running over rocky heights at full speed, begins the line with two dactyls, to imitate rapidity, and concludes it with eight long syllables:\n\nSaxa per, et icopulos, et depressas convalles.\n\n*Georg.* iii. 276.\n\nwhich is very unusual measure, but seems well adapted to the thing expressed, namely, to the descent of the animal from the hills to the low ground. At any rate, this extraordinary change of the rhythm may be allowed to bear some resemblance to the animal's change of motion, as it would be felt by a rider, and as we may suppose it is felt by the animal itself.\n\nOther forms of imitative harmony, and many other examples, besides those referred to in the margin, will readily occur to all who are conversant in the writings of the best versifiers; particularly Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lucretius, Spenser, Dryden, Shakespeare, Pope, and Gray.\n\nPart II. Of the Different Species of Poetry, with their Particular Principles.\n\nSect. I. Of Epic and Dramatic Compositions.\n\n\u00a7 1. The Epopee and Drama compared.\n\nTRAGEDY and the epic differ not in substantial things in both the same ends are proposed, viz. instruction and amusement; and in both the same mean is employed, viz. imitation of human actions. They differ only in the manner of imitating; epic poetry employs narration; tragedy represents its facts as passing in our sight; in the former, the poet introduces himself as an historian; in the latter, he presents his actors, and never himself.\n\nThis difference, regarding form only, may be thought slight; but the effects it occasions are by no means so; for what we see makes a deeper impression than what we learn from others. A narrative poem is a story told by another; facts and incidents passing upon the stage, come under our own observation; and are before much enlivened by action and gesture, expressive of many sentiments beyond the reach of language.\n\nA dramatic composition has another property, independent altogether of action; which is, that it makes a deeper impression than narration; in the former, persons express their own sentiments; in the latter, sentiments are related at second-hand. For that reason, Aristotle, the father of critics, lays it down as a rule*, that in an epic poem the author ought to have every opportunity of introducing his actors, and of confining the narrative part within the narrowest bounds. Homer understood perfectly the advantage of this method; and his poems are both of them in a great measure dramatic. Lucan runs to the opposite extreme; and is guilty of a still greater fault, in stuffing his *Pharsalia* with cold and languid reflections, the merit of which he affirms to himself, and deigns not to share with his actors. Nothing can be more injudiciously timed, than a chain of such reflections, which suspend the battle of Pharsalia, after the leaders had made their speeches, and the two armies are ready to engage\u2020.\n\nAristotle, from the nature of the fable, divides tragedy into simple and complex; but it is of greater moment, with respect to dramatic as well as epic poetry, to find a distinction upon the different ends attained by such compositions. A poem, whether dramatic or epic, that has nothing in view but to move the passions moral, and to exhibit pictures of virtue and vice, may be distinguished by the name of pathetic: but where a story is purposely contrived to illustrate some moral truth, by showing that disorderly passions naturally lead to external misfortunes, such composition may be denominated moral. Before making a deeper impression than can be done by cool reasoning, a moral poem does not fall short of reasoning in affording conviction: the natural connection of vice with misery, and of virtue with happiness, may be illustrated by stating a fact as well as by urging an argument. Let us assume, for example, the following moral truths: That discord among the chiefs renders ineffectual all common measures; and that the consequences of a slightly-founded quarrel, fostered by pride and arrogance, are not less fatal than those of the greatest injury: these truths may be inculcated by the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles at the siege of Troy. If facts or circumstances be wanting, such as tend to rouse the turbulent passions, they must be invented; but no accidental nor unaccountable event ought to be admitted; for the necessary or probable connection between vice and misery is not learned from any events but what are naturally occasioned by the characters and passions of the persons represented, acting in such circumstances. A real event, of which we see not the cause, may afford a lesson, upon the presumption that what hath happened may again happen; but this cannot be inferred from a story that is known to be a fiction.\n\nMany are the good effects of such compositions. A pathetic composition, whether epic or dramatic, tends to a habit of virtue, by exciting us to do what is right, effects of and restraining us from what is wrong. Its frequent pictures of human woes produce, beside, two effects extremely salutary: They improve our sympathy, and fortify us to bear our misfortunes. A moral composition must obviously produce the same good effects because by being moral it ceaseth not to be pathetic: it enjoys besides an excellence peculiar to itself; for it not only improves the heart, as above-mentioned, but instructs the head by the moral it contains. It seems impossible to imagine any entertainment more suited to a rational being, than a work thus happily illustrating some moral truth; where a number of persons of different characters are engaged in an important action, some retarding, others promoting, the great catastrophe; and where there is dignity of style as well as of matter. A work of this kind has our sympathy at command,\nmand, and can put in motion the whole train of the\nsocial affections: our curiosity in some scenes is ex-\ncited, in others gratified; and our delight is consum-\nmated at the close, upon finding, from the characters\nand situations exhibited at the commencement, that\nevery incident down to the final catastrophe is natural,\nand that the whole in conjunction make a regular chain\nof causes and effects.\n\nConsidering that an epic and a dramatic poem are the\nsame in substance, and have the same aim or end, one\nwill readily imagine, that subjects proper for the one\nmust be equally proper for the other. But considering\ntheir difference as to form, there will be found reason\nto correct that conjecture, at least in some degree.\n\nMany subjects may indeed be treated with equal ad-\nvantage in either form; but the subjects are still more\nnumerous for which they are not equally qualified; and\nthere are subjects proper for the one and not at all for\nthe other. To give some slight notion of the difference,\nas there is no room here for enlarging upon every article,\nwe observe, that dialogue is better qualified for ex-\npressing sentiments, and narrative for displaying facts.\nHeroism, magnanimity, undaunted courage, and other\nelevated virtues, figure best in action: tender passions,\nand the whole tribe of sympathetic affections, figure best\nin sentiment. It clearly follows, that tender passions are\nmore peculiarly the province of tragedy, grand and hero-\nic actions of epic poetry.\n\n\"The epic poem is universally allowed to be, of all\npoetical works, the most dignified, and, at the same time,\nthe most difficult in execution. To contrive a story which\nshall please and interest all readers, by being at once en-\ntertaining, important, and instructive; to fill it with suit-\nable incidents; to enliven it with a variety of characters\nand descriptions; and, throughout a long work, to main-\ntain that propriety of sentiment, and that elevation\nof style, which the epic character requires, is unquestion-\nably the highest effort of poetical genius.\n\n\"The action or subject of the epic poem must be great\nand interesting. Without greatness it would not have suf-\nficient importance either to fix our attention or to justify\nthe magnificent apparatus which the poet bestows on it.\nThis is evidently requisite as not to require illustration;\nand, indeed, hardly any who have attempted epic poetry\nhave failed in choosing some subject sufficiently important,\neither by the nature of the action or by the fame of the\npersonages concerned in it. The fame of Homer's heroes,\nand the consequences of diffusion between the greatest\nof them, is a subject important in itself, and must have\nappeared particularly so to his countrymen, who boasted\ntheir descent from those heroes. The subject of the Aeneid\nis still greater than that of the Iliad, as it is the founda-\ntion of the most powerful empire that ever was establish-\ned upon this globe; an event of much greater import-\nance than the destruction of a city, or the anger of a fe-\nmibarbarous warrior. But the poems of Homer and Vir-\ngil fall in this respect infinitely short of that of Milton.\n\nBefore the greatness displayed in Paradise Lost, it has\nbeen well observed that all other greatness shrinks away.\nThe subject of the English poet is not the destruction of\na city, the conduct of a colony, or the foundation of an\nempire: it is the fate of worlds, the revolutions of hea-\nven and earth; rebellion against the Supreme King, rais-\ned by the highest order of created beings; the overthrow\nof their host, and the punishment of their crime; the crea-\ntion of a new race of reasonable creatures; their original\nhappiness and innocence, their forfeiture of immortality,\nand their restoration to hope and peace.\"\n\nAn epic poem, however, is defective if its action be\nnot interesting as well as great; for a narrative of mere\nvalue may be so constructed as to prove cold and tire-\nsome. \"Much will depend on the happy choice of a\nsubject, which shall by its nature interest the public; as\nwhen the poet selects for his hero one who is the\nfounder, or the deliverer, or the favourite of his na-\ntion; or when he writes achievements that have been\nhighly celebrated, or have been connected with impor-\ntant consequences to any public cause. Most of the great\nepic poems are abundantly fortunate in this respect, and\nmust have been very interesting to those ages in which\nthey were composed.\" The subject of the Paradise Lost,\nas it is infinitely greater, must likewise be considered as\nmore universally interesting than that of any other poem.\n\n\"We all feel the effects of Adam's transgression; we all\nfeel like him, and like him must all bewail our offences.\nWe have reflexts and indignant enemies in the fallen angels,\nand in the blessed spirits we have guardians and friends;\nin the redemption of mankind we hope to be included;\nin the description of heaven and hell we are surely inte-\nrested, as we are all to reside hereafter either in the regions\nof horror or bliss.\"\n\n\"The chief circumstance which renders an epic poem cir-\ncumstances, and which tends to interest not one age or\ncountry alone, but all readers, is the skilful conduct of the\nauthor in the management of his subject. His plan of epic poetry,\nmust comprehend many affecting incidents. He may sometimes be\nawful and august; he must often be tender and pathetic; he must\ngive us gentle and pleasing scenes of love, friendship, and affection.\nThe more that an epic poem abounds with situations which awaken the\nfeelings of humanity, it is the more interesting. In this\nrespect perhaps no epic poets have been so happy as Vir-\ngil and Tasso. The plan of the Paradise Lost comprises\nneither human actions nor human manners. The man\nand woman who act and suffer, are in a state which no\nother man or woman can ever know. The reader finds\nno transaction in which he can be engaged; beholds no\ncondition in which he can by any effort of imagination\nplace himself; he has therefore little natural curiosity or\nsympathy.\"\n\nA question has been moved, Whether the nature of the\nepic poem does not require that the hero should be\nultimately successful? To this question Johnstone replies,\nthat \"there is no reason why the hero should not be\nsuccessful, except established practice, since success and\nvirtue do not necessarily go together.\" Most critics,\nhowever, are of a different opinion, and hold success to\nbe, if not the necessary, at least the most proper issue of\nan epic poem. An unhappy conclusion depresses the\nmind, and is opposite to the elevating emotions which\nbelong to this species of poetry. Terror and compassion\nare the proper subjects of tragedy; but as the epic is of\nlarger extent, it were too much, if, after the difficulties\nand troubles which commonly abound in the progress of\nthe poem, the author should bring them all at last to an\nunfortunate conclusion. We know not that any author\nof name has held this course except Lucan; for in the\nParadise Lost, as Adam's deceiver is at last crushed, and\nhe himself restored to the favour of his maker, Milton's\nhero must be considered as finally successful.\nWe have no occasion to say more of the epic, considered as peculiarly adapted to certain subjects, and to be conducted according to a certain plan. But as dramatic subjects are more complex, it is necessary to take a narrower view of them. They are either the light and the gay, or the grave and affecting, incidents of human life. The former constitute the subject of comedy, and the latter of tragedy.\n\nAs great and serious objects command more attention than little and ludicrous ones; as the fall of a hero interests the public more than the marriage of a private person; tragedy has been always held a more dignified entertainment than comedy. The first thing required of the tragic poet is, that he pitch upon some moving and interesting story, and that he conduct it in a natural and probable manner. For we must observe, that the natural and probable are more essential to tragic than even to epic poetry. Admiration is excited by the wonderful; but passion can be raised only by the impressions of nature and truth upon the mind.\n\nThe subject best fitted for tragedy is where a man has himself been the cause of his misfortune; not so as to be deeply guilty, nor altogether innocent: the misfortune must be occasioned by a fault incident to human nature, and therefore in some degree venial. Such misfortunes call forth the social affections, and warmly interest the spectator. An accidental misfortune, if not extremely singular, doth not greatly move our pity: the person who suffers, being innocent, is freed from the greatest of all torments, that anguish of mind which is occasioned by remorse. An atrocious criminal, on the other hand, who brings misfortunes upon himself, excites little pity, for a different reason: his remorse, it is true, aggravates his distress, and swells the first emotions of pity; but then our hatred of him as a criminal blending with pity, blunts its edge considerably. Misfortunes that are not innocent, nor highly criminal, partake the advantages of each extreme: they are attended with remorse to embitter the distress, which raises our pity to a great height; and the slight indignation we have at a venial fault detracts not sensibly from our pity. The happiest of all subjects accordingly for raising pity, is where a man of integrity falls into a great misfortune by doing an action that is innocent, but which, by some singular means, is conceived by him to be criminal: his remorse aggravates his distress; and our compassion, unrestrained by indignation, knows no bounds. Pity comes thus to be the ruling passion of a pathetic tragedy; and, by proper representation, may be raised to a height scarcely exceeded by any thing felt in real life. A moral tragedy takes in a larger field; as it not only exercises our pity, but raises another passion, which, though selfish, deserves to be cherished equally with the social affection. The passion we have in view is fear or terror; for when a misfortune is the natural consequence of some wrong bias in the temper, every spectator who is conscious of such a bias in himself takes the alarm, and dreads his falling into the same misfortune: and by the emotion of fear or terror, frequently reiterated in a variety of moral tragedies, the spectators are put upon their guard against the disorders of passion.\n\nThe commentators upon Aristotle, and other critics, have been much grappled about the account given of tragedy by that author: \"That by means of pity and terror, it refines or purifies in us all sorts of passion.\" But no one who has a clear conception of the end and effects of a good tragedy, can have any difficulty about Aristotle's meaning: our pity is engaged for the persons represented; and our terror is upon our own account. Pity indeed is here made to stand for all the sympathetic emotions, because of these it is the capital. There can be no doubt, that our sympathetic emotions are refined or improved by daily exercise; and in what manner our other passions are refined by terror, has been just now said. One thing is certain, that no other meaning can justly be given to the foregoing doctrine than that now mentioned; and that it was really Aristotle's meaning, appears from his 13th chapter, where he delivers several propositions conformable to the doctrine as here explained. There, at the same time, we take liberty to mention; because, so far as authority can go, they confirm the foregoing reasoning about subjects proper for tragedy. The first proposition is, That it being the province of tragedy to excite pity and terror, an innocent person falling into adversity ought never to be the subject. This proposition is a necessary consequence of his doctrine as explained; a subject of that nature may indeed excite pity and terror; but the former in an inferior degree, and the latter in no degree for moral instruction. The second proposition is, That the history of a wicked person in a change from misery to happiness ought not to be represented; which excites neither terror nor compasion, nor is agreeable in any respect. The third is, That the misfortunes of a wicked person ought not to be represented: such representation may be agreeable in some measure upon a principle of justice; but it will not move our pity, or any degree of terror, except in those of the same vicious disposition with the person represented. The last proposition is, That the only character fit for representation lies in the middle, neither eminently good nor eminently bad; where the misfortune is not the effect of deliberate vice, but of some involuntary fault, as our author expresses it. The only objection we find to Aristotle's account of tragedy, is, that he confines it within too narrow bounds, by refusing admittance to the pathetic kind: for if terror be essential to tragedy, no representation deserves that name but the moral kind, where the misfortunes exhibited are caused by a wrong balance of mind, or some disorder in the internal constitution: such misfortunes always suggest moral instruction; and by such misfortunes only can terror be excited for our improvement.\n\nThus Aristotle's four propositions above-mentioned relate solely to tragedies of the moral kind. Those of the pathetic kind are not confined within so narrow limits: subjects fitted for the theatre are not in such plenty as to make us reject innocent misfortunes which rouse our sympathy, though they inculcate no moral. With respect indeed to the subjects of that kind, it may be doubted, whether the conclusion ought not always to be fortunate. Where a person of integrity is represented as suffering to the end under misfortunes purely accidental, we depart discontented, and with some obscure sense of injustice: for seldom is man so submissive to Providence, as not to revolt against the tyranny and vexations of blind chance; he will be tempted to say, this ought not to be. We give for an example the Romeo and Juliet of Shakespeare, where the fatal catastrophe is occasioned by Friar Lawrence's coming to the monument a minute too late; we are vexed at the unlucky chance, and go away dissatisfied. Such impres-\nThe misfortunes of a virtuous person, arising from necessary causes, or a chain of unavoidable circumstances, as they excite a notion of destiny, are equally unsatisfactory to the human mind. A metaphysician in his closet may reason himself into the belief of fate, or what in modern language is called philosophical necessity; but the feelings of the heart revolt against that doctrine; and we have the confession of the two ablest philosophers by whom it was ever maintained, that men conduct themselves through life as if their will were absolutely free, and their actions no part of a chain of necessary causes and effects. As no man goes to the theatre to study metaphysics, or to divest himself of the common feelings of humanity, it is impossible, whatever be his philosophical creed, that he should contemplate without horror and disgust an innocent person suffering by mere destiny.\n\nA tragedy of uncommon merit in every other respect may indeed be endured, nay perhaps admired, though such be its catastrophe; because no work of man was ever perfect; and because, where imperfections are unavoidable, a multitude of excellencies may be allowed to cover one fault: but we believe the misery of an innocent person resulting from a chain of unavoidable circumstances has never been considered as a beauty by minds unperverted by a false philosophy. \"It must be acknowledged\" that the subjects of the ancient Greek tragedies were frequently founded on mere destiny and inevitable misfortunes. In the course of the drama many moral sentiments occurred; but the only intuition which the fable conveyed was, that reverence was due to the gods, and submission to the decrees of fate. Modern tragedy has aimed at a higher object, by becoming more the theatre of passion; pointing out to men the consequences of their own misconduct, showing the direful effects which ambition, jealousy, love, resentment, and other such strong emotions, when misguided or left unrestrained, produce upon human life. An Othello, hurried by jealousy to murder his innocent wife; a Jafer enraged by resentment and want to engage in a conspiracy, and then flung with remorse and involved in ruin; a Siffredi, through the deceit which he employs for public-spirited ends, bringing destruction on all whom he loved; these, and such as these, are the examples which Tragedy now displays to public view; and by means of which it inculcates on men the proper government of their passions.\"\n\nThere is indeed one singular drama, in which destiny is employed in a manner very different from that in which it was used by the poets of Greece and Rome. It is Schiller's tragedy of the Robbers, of which \"the hero endowed by nature (as the translator of the piece observes) with the most generous feelings, animated by the highest sense of honour, and susceptible of the warmest affections of the heart, is driven by the perfidy of a brother, and the suppos'd inhumanity of his father, into a state of confirmed misanthropy and despair.\" He wishes that he \"could blow the trumpet of rebellion through all nature; that he could extinguish with one mortal blow the viperous race of men; and that he could so strike as to destroy the germ of existence.\" In this situation he is hurried on to the perpetration of a series of crimes which find from their very magnitude and atrocity a recommendation to his dis temper'd mind. Sensible all the while of his own guilt, and suffering for that guilt the severest pangs of remorse, he yet believes himself an instrument of vengeance in the hands of the Almighty for the punishment of the crimes of others. In thus accomplishing the dreadful destiny, which is prescribed for him, he feels a species of gloomy satisfaction, at the same time that he considers himself as doomed to the performance of that part in life which is to confine his memory to infamy and his soul to perdition. After burning a town, he exclaims, \"O God of vengeance! am I to blame for this? Art thou to blame, O Father of Heaven! when the instruments of thy wrath, the pestilence, flood, and famine overwhelm at once the righteous and the guilty? Who can command the flames to lay their course, to destroy only the noxious vermin, and spare the fertile field?\" yet with the same breath he accuses himself of extreme criminality for \"presumptuously wielding the sword of the Most High!\" He frequently laments in the most affecting manner the loss of his innocence, wishes that \"he could return into the womb that bare him, that he hung an infant at the breast, that he were born a beggar, the meanest hind, a peasant of the field.\" He considers himself as the outcast of Heaven, and finally rejected by the Father of mercy; yet he tells the band of robbers whom he commanded, that the \"Almighty honoured them as agents in his hands to execute his wonderful purposes; employed them as his angels to execute his stern decrees, and pour the vials of his wrath;\" and in a very solemn prayer, he supposes that \"the God who ruleth over all had decreed that he should become the chief of these foul murderers.\"\n\n\"It will be allowed,\" says the translator, \"that the imagination could not have conceived a spectacle more deeply interesting, more powerfully affecting to the mind of man, than that of a human being thus characterized and acting under such impressions. The compassionate interest which the mind feels in the emotions or sufferings of the guilty person, is not diminished by the observation, that he acts under an impression of inevitable destiny; on the contrary, there is something in our nature which leads us the more to compaionate the instrument of those crimes, that we see him consider himself as bound to guilt by fetters, which he has the constant with, but not the strength, to break.\"\n\nThis is indeed true: we sympathise with the hero of the Robbers, not only on account of his exalted sentiments and his inflexible regard to the abstract principles of honour and justice, but much more for that disorder of intellect which makes him suppose \"his destiny fixed and unalterable,\" at the very time that he is torn with remorse for the perpetration of those crimes by which he believed it to be fulfilling. Destiny, however, is not in this tragedy exhibited as real, but merely as the phantom of a dis temper'd though noble mind. Had the poet represented his hero as in fact decreed by God, or bound by fate, to head a band of foul murderers, and to commit a series of the most atrocious crimes; though our pity for him might not have been lessened, the imprestions of the whole piece on the mind could have been only those of horror and disgust at what would have appeared to us the unequal ways of providence.\n\nThe Tragedy of the Robbers is a striking instance of the justness of Dr Blair's criticism, in opposition to that\nOf Lord Rames. His lordship holds that it is essential to a good tragedy, that its principal facts be borrowed from history; because a mixture of known truth with the fable tends to delude us into a conviction of the reality of the whole. The Doctor considers this as a matter of no great consequence; for \"it is proved by experience, that a fictitious tale, if properly conducted, will melt the heart as much as any real history;\" this observation is verified in the Robbers. It is indeed a very irregular drama, and perhaps could not be acted on a British theatre. But although the whole is known to be a fiction, we believe there are few effusions of human genius which more powerfully excite the emotions of terror and pity. Truth is indeed congenial to the mind; and when a subject proper for tragedy occurs in history or tradition, it is perhaps better to adopt it than to invent one which has no such foundation. But in choosing a subject which makes a figure in history, greater precaution is necessary than where the whole is a fiction. In the latter case, the author is under no restraint other than that the characters and incidents be just copies of nature. But where the story is founded on truth, no circumstances must be added, but such as connect naturally with what are known to be true; history may be supplied, but must not be contradicted. Further, the subject chosen must be distant in time, or at least in place; for the familiarity of recent persons and events ought to be avoided. Familiarity ought more especially to be avoided in an epic poem, the peculiar character of which is dignity and elevation: modern manners make but a poor figure in such a poem. Their familiarity unqualifies them for a lofty subject. The dignity of them will be better understood in future ages, when they are no longer familiar.\n\nAfter Voltaire, no writer, it is probable, will think of rearing an epic poem upon a recent event in the history of his own country. But an event of that kind is perhaps not altogether unqualified for tragedy: it was admitted in Greece; and Shakespeare has employed it successfully in several of his pieces. One advantage it possesses above fiction, that of more readily engaging our belief, which tends above any other particular to raise our sympathy. The scene of comedy is generally laid at home: familiarity is no objection; and we are peculiarly sensible of the ridicule of our own manners.\n\nAfter a proper subject is chosen, the dividing it into parts requires some art. The conclusion of a book in an epic poem, or of an act in a play, cannot be altogether arbitrary; nor be intended for so slight a purpose as to make the parts of equal length. The supposed pause at the end of every book, and the real pause at the end of every act, ought always to coincide with some pause in the action. In this respect, a dramatic or epic poem ought to resemble a sentence or period in language, divided into members that are distinguished from each other by proper pauses; or it ought to resemble a piece of music, having a full close at the end, preceded by imperfect closes that contribute to the melody. The division of every play into five acts has no other foundation than common practice, and the authority of Horace (D). It is a division purely arbitrary; there is nothing in the nature of the composition which fixes this number rather than any other; and it had been much better if no such number had been ascertained. But, since it is ascertained, every act in a dramatic poem ought to close with some incident that makes a pause in the action; for otherwise there can be no pretext for interrupting the representation. It would be absurd to break off in the very heat of action; against which every one would exclaim: the absurdity still remains where the action relents, if it be not actually suspended for some time. This rule is also applicable to an epic poem: though in it a deviation from the rule is less remarkable; because it is in the reader's power to hide the absurdity, by proceeding instantly to another book. The first book of Paradise Lost ends without any close, perfect or imperfect; it breaks off abruptly, where Satan, seated on his throne, is prepared to harangue the convocated host of the fallen angels; and the second book begins with the speech. Milton seems to have copied the \u00c6neid, of which the two first books are divided much in the same manner. Neither is there any proper pause at the end of the seventh book of Paradise Lost, nor at the end of the eleventh. In the Iliad little attention is given to this rule.\n\nBesides tragedy, dramatic poetry comprehends comedy and farce. There are sufficiently distinguished from tragedy by their general spirit and strain. \"While pity and terror, and the other strong passions, form the province of the tragic muse, the chief or rather sole instrument of comedy and farce is ridicule.\" These two species of composition are so perpetually running into each other, that we shall not treat of them separately; since what is now known by the name of farce differs in nothing essential from what was called the old comedy among the Greeks. \"Comedy proposes for its object neither the great sufferings nor the great crimes of men; Lectures, but their follies and lighter vices, those parts of their character which raise in beholders a sense of impropriety, which expose them to be censured and laughed at by others, or which render them troublesome in civil society.\"\n\n\"The subjects of tragedy are not limited to any age or country; but the scene and subject of comedy should always be laid in our own country, and in our own times. The reason is obvious: those decorums of behaviour, those lesser discriminations of character, which afford subject for comedy, change with the differences of countries and times; and can never be so well understood by foreigners as by natives. The comic poet, who aims at correcting improprieties and follies of behaviour, should 'catch the manners living as they rise.' It is not his business to amuse us with a tale of other times; but to give us pictures taken from among ourselves; to satirize\n\n(d) Novo minor, neu fit quinto productior actu Fabula.\n\nDe Arte Poetica.\n\nIf you would have your play deserve success,\nGive it five acts complete, nor more nor less. Francis.\nreigning and present vices; to exhibit to the age a faithful copy of itself, with its humours, its follies, and its extravagancies.\n\n\"Comedy may be divided into two kinds: comedy of character, and comedy of intrigue. The former is the more valuable species; because it is the business of comedy to exhibit the prevailing manners which mark the character of the age in which the scene is laid; yet there should be always as much intrigue as to give us something to wish and something to fear. The incidents should succeed one another, so as to produce striking situations, and to fix our attention; while they afford at the same time a proper field for the exhibition of character. The action in comedy, though it demands the poet's care in order to render it animated and natural, is a less significant and important part of the performance than the action in tragedy: as in comedy it is what men say, and how they behave, that draws our attention, rather than what they perform or what they suffer.\n\n\"In the management of characters, one of the most common faults of comic writers is the carrying of them too far beyond life. Wherever ridicule is concerned, it is indeed extremely difficult to hit the precise point where true wit ends and buffoonery begins. When the miser in Plautus, searching the person whom he suspects of having stolen his casket, after examining first his right hand and then his left, cries out, *offende etiam tertiam\u2014show me your third hand,* there is no one but must be sensible of the extravagance. Certain degrees of exaggeration are allowed to the comedian, but there are limits set to it by nature and good taste; and supposing the miser to be ever so much engrossed by his jealousy and his suspicions, it is impossible to conceive any man in his wits suspecting another of having more than two hands.\"\n\nIt appears from the plays of Aristophanes which remain, that the characters in the old comedy of Athens were almost always overcharged. They were likewise direct and avowed satires against particular persons, who were brought upon the stage by name. \"The ridicule employed in them is extravagant, the wit for the most part boisterous and sarcastic, the raillery biting and cruel, and the obscenity that reigns in them is gross and intolerable. They seem to have been composed merely for the mob.\" Yet of these abominable dramas, an excellent critic has affirmed, with too much truth, that what is now called *farce* is nothing more than the shadow. The characters in genuine comedy are not those of particular and known persons, but the general characters of the age and nation; which it requires no small skill to distinguish clearly and naturally from each other. In attempting this, poets are too apt to contrast characters and introduce them always in pairs; which gives an affected air to the whole piece. The perfection of art is to conceal art. \"A masterly writer will give us his characters distinguished rather by such shades of diversity as are commonly found in society, than marked with such strong oppositions as are rarely brought into actual contrast in any of the circumstances of real life.\"\n\nThe style of comedy ought to be pure, elegant, and lively, very seldom rising higher than the ordinary tone of polite conversation; and upon no occasion descending into vulgar, mean, and gross expressions; and in one word, action and character being the fundamental parts of every epic and dramatic composition, the sentiments and tone of language ought to be subservient to these, so as to appear natural and proper for the occasion.\n\n\u00a7 2. Respective peculiarities of the Epopee and Drama.\n\nIn a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior beings in a visible shape, no place in machinery can have. There is no place for such objection in an epic poem; a drama, and Boileau, with many other critics, declares strongly for that sort of machinery in an epic poem. But wavering authority, which is apt to impose upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from reason. We may in the first place observe, that this matter is but indistinctly handled by critics: the poetical privilege of animating intangible objects for enlivening a description, is very different from what is termed machinery, where deities, angels, devils, or other supernatural powers, are introduced as real personages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the catastrophe; and yet these two things are confusedly jumbled together in reasoning. The former is founded on a natural principle: but nothing is more unnatural than the latter. Its effects, at the same time, are deplorable. First, it gives an air of fiction to the whole; and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections, and to move our passions; which of itself is sufficient to explain machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination.\n\nAnd next, were it possible, by disguising the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, an imperceptible objection would still remain, which is, that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced; for an evident reason, that virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endowed with passions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions; and as for moral instruction, it is clear, that none can be drawn from beings who act not upon the same principles with us. A fable in Aesop's manner is no objection to this reasoning: his lions, bulls, and goats, are truly men under disguise; they act and feel in every respect as human beings; and the moral we draw is founded on that supposition. Homer, it is true, introduces the gods into his fable; but the religion of his country authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs. It must however be observed, that Homer's deities do no honour to his poems: fictions that transgress the bounds of nature, seldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste. They may be of some use to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials, of Nature's production, for elevating his subject, and making it interesting.\n\nOne would be apt to think, that Boileau, declaring for the Heathen deities, intended them only for embellishing the diction: but unluckily he banishes angels and devils, who undoubtedly make a figure in poetic language, equal to the Heathen deities. Boileau, therefore, by pleading for the latter in opposition to the former, certainly meant, if he had any distinct meaning, that the Heathen deities may be introduced as actors. And, in fact, he himself is guilty of that glaring absurdity, where\nwhere it is not so pardonable as in an epic poem: In his ode upon the taking of Namur, he demands with a most serious countenance, whether the walls were built by Apollo or Neptune; and in relating the passage of the Rhine, anno 1672, he describes the god of that river as fighting with all his might to oppose the French monarch; which is confounding fiction with reality at a strange rate. The French writers in general run into this error: wonderful the effect of custom, entirely to hide from them how ridiculous such fictions are.\n\nThat this is a capital error in Gierufalenme Liberata, Tasso's greatest admirers must acknowledge: a situation can never be intricate, nor the reader even in pain about the catastrophe, to long as there is an angel, devil, or magician, to lend a helping hand. Voltaire, in his essay upon epic poetry, talking of the Pharsalia, observes judiciously, \"That the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and political, joined with the fidelity of Lucan's subject, deprived him of poetical fiction.\" Is it not amazing, that a critic who reasons to justify with respect to others, can be so blind with respect to himself? Voltaire, not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior beings, introduces them into the action: in the fifth canto of the Henriade, St Louis appears in person, and terrifies the soldiers; in the seventh canto, St Louis sends the god of Sleep to Henry; and, in the tenth, the Demons of Discord, Fanaticism, War, &c., afflit Amaule in a single combat with Furetane, and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God. To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate; and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV. But perfection is not the lot of man.\n\nBut perhaps the most successful weapon that can be employed upon this subject is ridicule. Addison has applied this in an elegant manner: \"Whereas the time of a general peace is, in all appearance, drawing near; being informed that there are several ingenious persons who intend to show their talents to happy an occasion, and being willing, as much as in me lies, to prevent that effusion of nonsense which we have good cause to apprehend: I do hereby strictly require every person who shall write on this subject, to remember that he is a Christian, and not to sacrifice his catechism to his poetry. In order to it, I do expect of him, in the first place, to make his own poem, without depending upon Phocbus for any part of it, or calling out for aid upon any of the Muses by name. I do likewise positively forbid the sending of Mercury with any particular message or dispatch relating to the peace; and shall by no means suffer Minerva to take upon her the shape of any plenipotentiary concerned in this great work. I do further declare, that I shall not allow the Delphins to have had a hand in the deaths of the several thousands who have been slain in the late war; being of opinion that all such deaths may be well accounted for by the Christian system of powder and ball. I do therefore strictly forbid the Fates to cut the thread of man's life upon any pretence whatsoever, unless it be for the sake of rhyme. And whereas I have good reason to fear, that Neptune will have a great deal of business on his hands in several poems which we may now suppose are upon the anvil, I do also prohibit his appearance, unless it be done in metaphor, simile, or any very short allusion; and that even here he may not be permitted to enter, but with great caution and circumspection. I declare that the same rule may be extended to his whole fraternity of Heathen gods; it being my design to condemn every poem to the flames in which Jupiter thunders, or exercises any other act of authority which does not belong to him. In short, I expect that no pagan agent shall be introduced, or any fact related which a man cannot give credit to with a good conscience. Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend, or be continued to extend to several of the female poets in this nation, who shall still be left in full possession of their gods and goddesses, in the same manner as if this paper had never been written.\"\n\nThe marvellous is indeed too much promoted by machinery, that it is not wonderful to find it embraced by the bulk of writers, and perhaps of readers. If indulged at all, it is generally indulged to excess. Homer introduces his deities with no greater ceremony than his mortals; and Virgil has still less moderation: a pilot spent with watching cannot fall asleep and drop into the sea by natural means: one bed cannot receive the two lovers Aeneas and Dido, without the immediate interposition of superior powers. The ridiculous in such fictions must appear even through the thickest veil of gravity and solemnity.\n\nAngels and devils serve equally with Heathen deities as materials for figurative language; perhaps better among Christians, because we believe in them, and not in Heathen deities. But every one is sensible, as well as Boileau, that the invisible powers in our creed make a much worse figure as actors in a modern poem than the invisible powers in the Heathen creed did in ancient poems; the cause of which is not far to seek. The Heathen deities, in the opinion of their votaries, were beings elevated one step only above mankind, subject to the same passions, and directed by the same motives; therefore not altogether improper to mix with men in an important action. In our creed, superior beings are placed at such a mighty distance from us, and are of a nature so different, that with no propriety can we appear with them upon the same stage: man, a creature much inferior, loses all dignity in the comparison.\n\nThere can be no doubt that an historical poem admits an historical embellishment of allegory as well as of metaphor, cal poem simile, or other figure. Moral truth, in particular, is admits of allegory, finely illustrated in the allegorical manner; it annuls the fancy to find abstract terms, by a sort of magic, metamorphosed into active beings; and it is delightful to fictionists trace a general proposition in a pictured event. But allegorical beings should be confined within their own sphere, and never be admitted to mix in the principal action, nor to co-operate in retarding or advancing the catastrophe; which would have a still worse effect than invisible powers: for the impression of real existence, essential to an epic poem, is inconsistent with that figurative existence which is essential to an allegory; and therefore no method can more effectually prevent the impression of reality than the introduction of allegorical beings co-operating with those whom we conceive to be really existing. The love-episode in the Henriade (canto 9.), insufferable by the discordant mixture of allegory with real life, is copied from that of Rinaldo and Armida in the Gierufalenme Liberata, which hath no merit.\n\nPart II.\n\nmerit to entitle it to be copied. An allegorical object, such as Fame in the Aeneid, and the Temple of Love in the Hymn, may find place in a description; but to introduce Discord as a real personage, imploring the affluence of Love as another real personage, to ennervate the courage of the hero, is making these figurative beings act beyond their sphere, and creating a strange jumble of truth and fiction. The allegory of Sin and Death in the Paradise Lost is possibly not generally relished, though it is not entirely of the same nature with what we have been condemning; in a work comprehending the achievements of superior beings there is more room for fancy than where it is confined to human actions.\n\nWhat is the true notion of an episode? or how is it to be distinguished from the principal action? Every incident that promotes or retards the catastrophe must be part of the principal action. This clears the nature of an episode; which may be defined, \"An incident connected with the principal action, but contributing neither to advance nor retard it.\" The descent of Aeneas into hell does not advance or retard the catastrophe, and therefore is an episode. The story of Nissus and Euryalus, producing an alteration in the affairs of the contending parties, is a part of the principal action. The family-feud in the sixth book of the Iliad is of the same nature; for by Hector's retiring from the field of battle to visit his wife, the Grecians had opportunity to breathe, and even to turn upon the Trojans. The unavoidable effect of an episode according to this definition must be, to break the unity of action; and therefore it ought never to be indulged unless to unbend the mind after the fatigue of a long narration. An episode, when such is its purpose, requires the following conditions: it ought to be well connected with the principal action; it ought to be lively and interesting; it ought to be short; and a time ought to be chosen when the principal action relents (x).\n\nIn the following beautiful episode, which closes the second book of Fingal, all these conditions are united.\n\n\"Comal was a son of Albion; the chief of an hundred hills. His deer drunk of a thousand streams; and a thousand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs. His face was the mildness of youth; but his hand the death of heroes. One was his love, and fair was she! the daughter of mighty Conloch. She appeared like a sun-beam among women, and her hair was like the wing of the raven. Her soul was fixed on Comal, and she was his companion in the chase. Often met their eyes of love, and happy were their words in secret. But Gormal loved the maid, the chief of gloomy Ardven. He watched her lone steps on the heath, the foe of unhappy Comal.\n\n\"One day, tired of the chace, when the mist had concealed their friends, Comal and the daughter of Conloch met in the cave of Ronan. It was the wonted haunt of Comal. Its sides were hung with his arms; a hundred shields of thongs were there, a hundred helms of sounding steel. Rest here, said he, my love Galvina, thou light of the cave of Ronan: a deer appears on the brow of Mora; I go, but soon will return. I hear, said she, dark Gormal my foe: I will rest here; but soon return, my love.\n\n\"He went to the deer of Mora. The daughter of Conloch, to try his love, clothed her white hide with his armour, and frode from the cave of Ronan. Thinking her his foe, his heart beat high, and his colour changed. He drew the bow: the arrow flew: Galvina fell in blood. He ran to the cave with halting steps, and called the daughter of Conloch. Where art thou, my love? but no answer. He marked, at length, her heaving heart beating against the mortal arrow. O Conloch's daughter, is it thou!\u2014he sunk upon her breast.\n\n\"The hunters found the hapless pair. Many and silent were their steps round the dark dwellings of his love. The fleet of the ocean came: he fought, and the strangers fell: he searched for death over the field; but who could kill the mighty Comal? Throwing away his shield, an arrow found his manly breast. He sleeps with his Galvina: their green tombs are seen by the mariner when he bounds on the waves of the north.\"\n\nNext, upon the peculiarities of a dramatic poem. And double plot the first we shall mention is a double plot: one of which in a drama must resemble an episode in an epic poem; for it would be successful, distract the spectator, instead of entertaining him, if he were forced to attend at the same time to two capital plots equally interesting. And even supposing it an under-plot like an episode, it seldom hath a good effect in tragedy, of which simplicity is a chief property; for an interesting subject that engages our affections, occupies our whole attention, and leaves no room for any separate concern. Variety is more tolerable in comedy; which pretends only to amuse, without totally occupying the mind. But even there, to make a double plot agreeable, is no slight effort of art; the under-plot ought not to vary greatly in its tone from the principal; for discordant emotions are unpleasant when jumbled together; which, by the way, is an infrequent objection to tragic-comedy. Upon that account the Provok'd Husband deserves censure; all the scenes that bring the family of the Wrongheads into action, being ludicrous and farcical, are in a very different tone from the principal scenes, displaying severe and bitter expostulations between Lord Townley and his lady. The same objection touches not the double plot of the Careless Husband; the different subjects being sweetly connected, and having only so much variety as to resemble shades of colours harmoniously mixed. But this is not all. The under-plot ought to be connected with that which is principal, so much at least as to employ the same persons: the under-plot ought to occupy the intervals or pauses of the principal action; and both ought to be concluded together. This is the case of the Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nViolent action ought never to be represented on the violent stage. While the dialogue goes on, a thousand particulars representing...\nculars concur to delude us into an impression of reality; genuine sentiments, passionate language, and persuasive gesture: the spectator, once engaged, is willing to be deceived, loses sight of himself, and without scruple enjoys the spectacle as a reality. From this absent state he is roused by violent action; he wakes as from a pleasing dream; and, gathering his senses about him, finds all to be a fiction. Horace delivers the same rule; and founds it upon the same reason:\n\nNe pueros coram populo Medea trucidet;\nAut humana palam coquet exta nefariori Atreus;\nAut in avem Progne veritar, Cadmus in anguem:\nQuodcumque offendis milii lic, incredulus odi.\n\nThe French critics join with Horace in excluding blood from the stage; but overlooking the most substantial objection, they urge only that it is barbarous and shocking to a polite audience. The Greeks had no notion of such delicacy, or rather effeminacy; witness the murder of Clytemnestra by her son Orestes, passing behind the scene, as represented by Sophocles: her voice is heard calling out for mercy, bitter expostulations on his part, loud shrieks upon her being stabbed, and then a deep silence. An appeal may be made to every person of feeling, whether this scene be not more horrible than if the deed had been committed in sight of the spectators upon a sudden gust of passion. If Corneille, in representing the affair between Horatius and his sister, upon which the murder ensues behind the scene, had no other view but to remove from the spectators a shocking action, he was guilty of a capital mistake: for murder in cold blood, which in some measure was the case as represented, is more shocking to a polite audience, even where the conclusive stab is not seen, than the same act performed in their presence by violent and unpremeditated passion, as suddenly repeated as committed. Ad-\n\n* Spectator, dillon's observation is just*. That no part of this incident ought to have been represented, but referred for a narrative, with every alleviating circumstance in favour of the hero.\n\nA few words upon the dialogue, which ought to be so conducted as to be a true representation of nature. We talk not here of the sentiments nor of the language (which are treated elsewhere); but of what properly belongs to dialogue-writing; where every single speech, short or long, ought to arise from what is said by the former speaker, and furnish matter for what comes after till the end of the scene. In this view, all the speeches from first to last represent many links of one regular chain. No author, ancient or modern, possesses the art of dialogue equal to Shakespeare. Dryden, in that particular, may justly be placed as his opposite. He frequently introduces three or four persons speaking upon the same subject, each throwing out his own notions separately, without regarding what is said by the rest: take for an example the first scene of Aurenzebe. Sometimes he makes a number club in relating an event, not to a stranger supposed ignorant of it, but to one another, for the sake merely of speaking; of which notable sort of dialogue we have a specimen in the first scene of the first part of the Conquest of Granada. In the second part of the same tragedy, scene second, the King, Abenamar, and Zulema, make their separate observations, like so many colloquies, upon the fluctuating temper of the mob; a dialogue so uncouth puts one in mind of two shepherds in a pastoral excited by a prize to pronounce verses alternately, each in praise of his own mistress.\n\nThis manner of dialogue-writing, besides an unnatural air, has another bad effect; it stays the course of the action, because it is not productive of any consequence. In Congreve's comedies, the action is often suspended to make way for a play of wit.\n\nNo fault is more common among writers than to prolong a speech after the impatience of the person to whom it is addressed ought to prompt him or her to break in. Consider only how the impatient actor is to behave in the mean time. To express his impatience in violent action without interrupting would be unnatural; and yet, to dissemble his impatience, by appearing cool where he ought to be highly inflamed, would be no less so.\n\nRhyme being unnatural and difficult in dialogue, is happily banished from our theatre: the only wonder is that it ever found admittance, especially among a people accustomed to the more manly freedom of Shakespeare's dialogue. By banishing rhyme, we have gained so much as never once to dream that there can be any further improvement. And yet, however suitable blank verse may be to elevated characters and warm passions, it must appear improper and affected in the mouths of the lower sort. Why then should it be a rule, that every scene in tragedy must be in blank verse? Shakespeare, with great judgement, has followed a different rule; which is, to intermix prose with verse, and only to employ the latter where it is required by the importance or dignity of the subject. Familiar thoughts and ordinary facts ought to be expressed in plain language: to hear, for example, a footman deliver a simple message in blank verse must appear ridiculous to every one who is not baffled by custom. In short, that variety of characters and of situations, which is the life of a play, requires not only a suitable variety in the sentiments, but also in the diction.\n\n\u00a7 3. The Three Unities.\n\nWhen we consider the chain of causes and effects in the material world, independent of purpose, design, or thought, we find a number of incidents in succession, without beginning, middle, or end: every thing that happens is both a cause and an effect; being the effect of what goes before, and the cause of what follows: one incident may affect us more, another less; but all of them are links in the universal chain: the mind, in viewing these incidents, cannot rest or settle ultimately upon any one; but is carried along in the train without any close.\n\nBut when the intellectual world is taken under view, in conjunction with the material, the scene is varied, unity of Man acts with deliberation, will, and choice: he aims at some end; glory, for example, or riches, or conquest; the procuring happiness to individuals, or to his country in general: he proposes means, and lays plans to attain the end proposed. Here are a number of facts or incidents leading to the end in view, the whole composing one chain by the relation of cause and effect. In running over a series of such facts or incidents, we cannot rest upon any one; because they are presented to us as means only, leading to some end; but we rest with satisfaction upon the end or ultimate event; because there the purpose or aim of the chief person or persons is accomplished. This indicates the beginning, the middle, and\nThe Three and the end, of what Aristotle calls an entire action*. Unities.\n\nThe story naturally begins with describing those circumstances which move the person who acts the principal part to form a plan, in order to compass some desired event; the prosecution of that plan, and the obstructions, carry the reader into the heat of action; the middle is properly where the action is the most involved; and the end is where the event is brought about, and the plan accomplished.\n\nWe have given the foregoing example of a plan crowned with success, because it affords the clearest conception of a beginning, a middle, and an end, in which consists unity of action; and indeed stricter unity cannot be imagined than in that case. But an action may have unity, or a beginning, middle, and end, without to intimate a relation of parts; as where the catastrophe is different from what is intended or desired, which frequently happens in our best tragedies. In the \u00c6neid, the hero, after many obstructions, makes his plan effectual. The Iliad is formed upon a different model: it begins with the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon; goes on to describe the several effects produced by that cause; and ends in a reconciliation. Here is unity of action, no doubt, a beginning, a middle, and an end; but inferior to that of the \u00c6neid, which will thus appear. The mind hath a propensity to go forward in the chain of history; it keeps always in view the expected event; and when the incidents or underparts are connected by their relation to the event, the mind runs sweetly and easily along them. This pleasure we have in the \u00c6neid. It is not altogether so pleasant to connect, as in the Iliad, effects by their common cause; for such connection forces the mind to a continual retrospect; looking backward is like walking backward.\n\nIf unity of action be a capital beauty in fable imitative of human affairs, a plurality of unconnected fables must be a capital deformity. For the sake of variety we indulge an under-plot that is connected with the principal; but two unconnected events are extremely unpleasant, even where the same actors are engaged in both. Ariosto is quite licentious in that particular: he carries on at the same time a plurality of unconnected stories. His only excuse is, that his plan is perfectly well adjusted to his subject; for every thing in the Orlando Furioso is wild and extravagant.\n\nThough to state facts in the order of time be natural, yet that order may be varied for the sake of conspicuous beauties. If, for example, a noted story, cold and simple in its first movements, be made the subject of an epic poem, the reader may be hurried into the heat of action; reserving the preliminaries for a conversation piece, if thought necessary; and that method, at the same time, has a peculiar beauty from being dramatic. But a privilege that deviates from nature ought to be sparingly indulged; and yet romance writers make no difficulty of presenting to the reader, without the least preparation, unknown persons engaged in some arduous adventure equally unknown. In Cassandra, two personages, who afterwards are discovered to be the heroes of the fable, start up completely armed upon the banks of the Euphrates, and engage in a single combat.\n\nA play analysed is a chain of connected facts, of which each scene makes a link. Each scene, accordingly, ought to produce some incident relative to the catastrophe or ultimate event, by advancing or retarding it. A scene that produces no incident, and for that reason may be termed barren, ought not to be indulged, because it breaks the unity of action: a barren scene can never be intitled to a place, because the chain is complete without it. In the Old Bachelor, the 3d scene of act 2, and all that follow to the end of that act, are mere conversation-pieces, productive of no consequence. The 10th and 11th scenes, act 3, Double Dealer, and the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th scenes, act 1, Love for Love, are of the same kind. Neither is The Way of World entirely guiltless of such scenes. It will be no justification that they help to display characters: it were better, like Dryden in his dramatis personae, to describe characters beforehand, which would not break the chain of action. But a writer of genius has no occasion for such artifice; he can display the characters of his personages much more to the life in sentiment and action. How successfully is this done by Shakespeare! in whose works there is not to be found a single barren scene.\n\nUpon the whole, it appears, that all the facts in an historical fable ought to have a mutual connection, by their common relation to the grand event or catastrophe. And this relation, in which the unity of action consists, is equally essential to epic and dramatic compositions.\n\nHow far the unities of time and of place are essential, is a question of greater intricacy. These unities were strictly observed in the Greek and Roman theatres; and time and place are inculcated by the French and English critics as essential to every dramatic composition. In theory these essential unities are also acknowledged by our best poets, though their practice seldom corresponds: they are often forced to take liberties, which they pretend not to justify, against the practice of the Greeks and Romans, and against the solemn decision of their own countrymen. But in the course of this inquiry it will be made evident, that in this article we are under no necessity to copy the ancients; and that our critics are guilty of a mistake, in admitting no greater latitude of place and time than was admitted in Greece and Rome.\n\nIndeed the unities of place and time are not, by the most rigid critics, required in a narrative poem. In such composition, if it pretend to copy nature, these unities would be absurd; because real events are seldom confined within narrow limits either of place or of time: and yet we can follow history, or an historical fable, through all its changes, with the greatest facility; we never once think of measuring the real time by what is taken in reading; nor of forming any connection between the place of action and that which we occupy.\n\nWe are aware, that the drama differs so far from the epic as to admit different rules. It will be observed, \"That an historical fable, intended for reading solely, is under no limitation of time or of place more than a genuine history; but that a dramatic composition cannot be accurately represented unless it be limited, as its representation is, to one place and to a few hours; and therefore that no fable can be admitted but what has these properties, because it would be absurd to compose a piece for representation that cannot be justly represented.\" This argument has at least a plausible appearance; and yet one is apt to suspect some fallacy, considering that no critic, however strict, has ventured to confine the unities of place and of time within so narrow bounds.\n\nA view of the Grecian drama, compared with our own, may\nmay perhaps relieve us from this dilemma: if they be differently constructed, as shall be made evident, it is possible that the foregoing reasoning may not be equally applicable to both.\n\nAll authors agree, that tragedy in Greece was derived from the hymns in praise of Bacchus, which were sung in parts by a chorus. Thespis, to relieve the fingers, and for the sake of variety, introduced one actor, whose province it was to explain historically the subject of the song, and who occasionally represented one or other personage. Echylus, introducing a second actor, formed the dialogue; by which the performance became dramatic; and the actors were multiplied when the subject represented made it necessary. But still the chorus, which gave a beginning to tragedy, was considered as an essential part. The first scene, generally, unfolds the preliminary circumstances that lead to the grand event; and this scene is by Aristotle termed the prologue. In the second scene, where the action properly begins, the chorus is introduced, which, as originally, continues upon the stage during the whole performance: the chorus frequently makes one in the dialogue; and when the dialogue happens to be suspended, the chorus, during the interval, is employed in singing. Sophocles adheres to this plan religiously. Euripides is not altogether so correct. In some of his pieces it becomes necessary to remove the chorus for a little time; but when that unusual step is risked, matters are so ordered as not to interrupt the representation: the chorus never leave the stage of their own accord, but at the command of some principal personage, who constantly waits their return.\n\nThus the Grecian drama is a continued representation without any interruption; a circumstance that merits attention. A continued representation without a pause affords not opportunity to vary the place of action, nor to prolong the time of the action beyond that of the representation. To a representation so confined in place and time, the foregoing reasoning is strictly applicable: a real or feigned action, that is brought to a conclusion after considerable intervals of time and frequent changes of place, cannot accurately be copied in a representation that admits no latitude in either. Hence it is, that the unities of place and of time, were, or ought to have been, strictly observed in the Greek tragedies; which is made necessary by the very constitution of their drama, for it is absurd to compose a tragedy that cannot be justly represented.\n\nModern critics, who for our drama pretend to establish rules founded on the practice of the Greeks, are guilty of an egregious blunder. The unities of place and of time were in Greece, as we see, a matter of necessity, not of choice; and it is easy to show, that if we submit to such fetters, it must be from choice, not necessity. This will be evident upon taking a view of the constitution of our drama, which differs widely from that of Greece; whether more or less perfect, is a different point, to be handled afterward. By dropping the chorus, opportunity is afforded to divide the representation by intervals of time, during which the stage is evacuated and the spectacle suspended. This qualifies our drama for subjects spread through a wide space both of time and of place: the time supposed to pass during the suspension of the representation is not measured by the time of the suspension; and any place may be supposed, as it is not in sight: by which means, many subjects can be justly represented in our theatres, that were excluded from those of ancient Greece. This doctrine may be illustrated, by comparing a modern play to a set of historical pictures; let us suppose them five in number, and the resemblance will be complete: each of the pictures resembles an act in one of our plays: there must necessarily be the strictest unity of place and of time in each picture; and the same necessity requires these two unities during each act of a play, because during an act there is no interruption in the spectacle. Now, when we view in succession a number of such historical pictures, let it be, for example, the history of Alexander by Le Brun, we have no difficulty to conceive, that months or years have passed between the events exhibited in two different pictures, though the interruption is imperceptible in passing our eye from the one to the other; and we have as little difficulty to conceive a change of place, however great: in which view, there is truly no difference between five acts of a modern play and five such pictures. Where the representation is suspended, we can with the greatest facility suppose any length of time or any change of place: the spectator, it is true, may be conscious, that the real time and place are not the same with what are employed in the representation; but this is a work of reflection; and by the same reflection he may also be conscious, that Garrick is not King Lear, that the playhouse is not Dover cliffs, nor the noise he hears thunder and lightning. In a word, after an interruption of the representation, it is not more difficult for a spectator to imagine a new place, or a different time, than, at the commencement of the play, to imagine himself at Rome, or in a period of time two thousand years back. And indeed, it is abundantly ridiculous, that a critic, who is willing to hold candlelight for sunshine, and some painted canvasses for a palace or a prison, should affect so much difficulty in imagining a latitude of place or of time in the fable, beyond what is necessary in the representation.\n\nThere are, it must be acknowledged, some effects of great latitude in time, that ought never to be indulged in a composition for the theatre: nothing can be more absurd, than at the close to exhibit a full-grown person to be in who appears a child at the beginning: the mind rejects, dulged, as contrary to all probability, such latitude of time as is requisite for a change so remarkable. The greatest change from place to place hath not altogether the same bad effect: in the bulk of human affairs place is not material; and the mind, when occupied with an interesting event, is little regardless of minute circumstances: these may be varied at will, because they scarcely make any impression.\n\nAt the same time, it is not here meant to justify liberty without any reserve. An unbounded licence with place-relation to place and time, is faulty, for a reason that seems to have been overlooked, which is, that it seldom fails to break the unity of action: in the ordinary course of human affairs, single events, such as are fit to be represented on the stage, are confined to a narrow spot, and generally employ no great extent of time; and accordingly we seldom find strict unity of action in a dramatic composition, where any remarkable latitude is indulged in these particulars. It may even be admitted, that a composition of which employs but one place, and requires not a greater length of time than is necessary for the representation, is chap. 23.\nso much the more perfect; because the confining an event within so narrow bounds, contributes to the unity of action, and also prevents that labour, however slight, which the mind must undergo in imagining frequent changes of place, and many intervals of time. But still we must insist, that such limitation of place and time as was necessary in the Grecian drama, is no rule to us; and therefore, that though such limitation adds one beauty more to the composition, it is at best but a refinement, which may justly give place to a thousand beauties more substantial. And we may add, that it is extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to contract within the Grecian limits any fable so fruitful of incidents in number and variety as to give full scope to the fluctuation of passion.\n\nIt may now appear, that critics who put the unities of place and of time upon the same footing with the unity of action, making them all equally essential, have not attended to the nature and constitution of the modern drama. If they admit an interrupted representation, with which no writer finds fault, it is absurd to reject its greatest advantages, that of representing many interesting subjects excluded from the Grecian stage. If there needs must be a reformation, why not restore the ancient chorus and the ancient continuity of action? There is certainly no medium; for to admit an interruption without relaxing from the strict unities of place and of time, is in effect to load us with all the inconveniences of the ancient drama, and at the same time to withhold from us its advantages.\n\nAnd therefore the only proper question is, Whether our model be or be not a real improvement? This indeed may fairly be called in question; and in order to a comparative trial, some particulars must be premised. When a play begins, we have no difficulty to adjust our imagination to the scene of action, however distant it be in time or in place; because we know that the play is a representation only. The case is very different after we are engaged: it is the perfection of representation to hide itself, to impose on the spectator, and to produce in him an impression of reality, as if he were spectator of a real event; but any interruption annihilates that impression, by rousing him out of his waking dream, and unhappily restoring him to his senses. So difficult it is to support the impression of reality, that much lighter interruptions than the interval between two acts are sufficient to dissolve the charm: in the fifth act of the Mourning Bride, the three first scenes are in a room of state, the fourth in a prison; and the change is operated by shifting the scene, which is done in a trice; but however quick the transition may be, it is impracticable to impose upon the spectators so as to make them conceive that they are actually carried from the palace to the prison; they immediately reflect, that the palace and prison are imaginary, and that the whole is a fiction.\n\nFrom these premises, one will naturally be led, at first view, to pronounce the frequent interruptions in the modern drama to be an imperfection. It will occur, \"That every interruption must have the effect to banish the dream of reality, and with it to banish our concern, which cannot subsist while we are conscious that all is a fiction;\" and therefore, that in the modern drama, sufficient time is not afforded for fluctuation and swelling of passion, like what is afforded in that of Greece, where there is no interruption.\" This reasoning, it must be owned, has a specious appearance: but we must not become faint-hearted upon the first repulse; let us rally our troops for a second engagement.\n\nOn the Greek stage, whatever may have been the case on the Roman, the representation was never interrupted, and the division by acts was totally unknown. The word act never once occurs in Aristotle's Poetics, in which he defines exactly every part of the drama, and divides it into the beginning, the middle, and the end. At certain intervals indeed the actors retired; but the stage was not then left empty, nor the curtain let fall; for the chorus continued and sung. Neither do these songs of the chorus divide the Greek tragedies into five portions similar to our acts; though some of the commentators have endeavoured to force them into this office. But it is plain, that the intervals at which the chorus sung are extremely unequal and irregular, suited to the occasion and the subject; and would divide the play sometimes into three, sometimes into seven or eight acts.\n\nAs practice has now established a different plan on the modern stage, has divided every play into five acts, and made a total pause in the representation at the end of each act, the question to be considered is, Whether the plan of the ancient or of the modern drama is best qualified for making a deep impression on the mind? That the preference is due to the plan of the modern drama, will be evident from the following considerations. If it be indeed true, as the advocates for the three unities allege, that the audience is deluded into the belief of the reality of a well-acted tragedy, it is certain that this delusion cannot be long supported; for when the spirits are exhausted by close attention, and by the agitation of passion, an uneasiness ensues, which never fails to banish the waking dream. Now supposing the time that a man can employ with strict attention without wandering to be no greater than is requisite for a single act (a supposition that cannot be far from truth), it follows, that a continued representation of longer endurance than an act, instead of giving scope to fluctuation and swelling of passion, would overstrain the attention, and produce a total absence of mind. In this respect, the four pauses have a fine effect: for by affording to the audience a tolerable respite when the impression of reality is gone, and while nothing material is in agitation, they relieve the mind from its fatigue; and consequently prevent a wandering of thought at the very time possibly of the most interesting scenes.\n\nIn one article, indeed, the Grecian model has greatly the advantage: its chorus, during an interval, not only preserves alive the impressions made upon the audience, but also prepares their hearts finely for new impressions. In our theatres, on the contrary, the audience, at the end of every act, being left to trifle time away, lose every warm impression; and they begin the next act cool and unconcerned, as at the commencement of the representation. This is a great malady in our theatrical representations; but a malady that luckily is not incurable: to revive the Grecian chorus, would be to revive the Grecian slavery of place and time; but we can figure a detached chorus coinciding with a pause in the representation, as the ancient chorus did with a pause in the principal action. What objection, for example, can there lie against music between the acts, vocal and instrumental,\nThe three instrumental, adapted to the subject? Such detached chorus, without putting us under any limitation of time or place, would recruit the spirits, and would preserve entire the tone, if not the tide, of passion: the music, after an act, should commence in the tone of the preceding passion, and be gradually varied till it accord with the tone of the passion that is to succeed in the next act. The music and the representation would both of them be gainers by their conjunction; which will thus appear. Music that accords with the present tone of mind, is, on that account, doubly agreeable; and accordingly, though music singly hath not power to raise a passion, it tends greatly to support a passion already raised. Further, music prepares us for the passion that follows, by making cheerful, tender, melancholy, or animated impressions, as the subject requires. Take for an example the first scene of the Mourning Bride, where soft music, in a melancholy strain, prepares us for Almea's deep distress. In this manner, music and representation support each other delightfully: the impression made upon the audience by the representation, is a fine preparation for the music that succeeds; and the impression made by the music is a fine preparation for the representation that succeeds. It appears evident, that by some such contrivance, the modern drama may be improved, so as to enjoy the advantage of the ancient chorus without its slavish limitation of place and time. But to return to the comparison between the ancient and the modern drama.\n\nThe numberless improprieties forced upon the Greek dramatic poets by the constitution of their drama, may be sufficient, one should think, to make us prefer the modern drama, even abstracting from the improvement proposed. To prepare the reader for this article, it must be premised, that in the ancient drama the place of action never varies, a place necessarily must be chosen to which every person may have access without any improbability. This confines the scene to some open place, generally the court or area before a palace; which excludes from the Grecian theatre transactions within doors, though these commonly are the most important. Such cruel restraint is of itself sufficient to cramp the most pregnant invention; and accordingly the Greek writers, in order to preserve unity of place, are reduced to woful improprieties. In the Hippolytus of Euripides (act i. sc. 6.), Phaedra, distressed in mind and body, is carried without any pretext from her palace to the place of action; there laid upon a couch, unable to support herself upon her limbs; and made to utter many things improper to be heard by a number of women who form the chorus: and what is still more improper, her female attendant uses the strongest entreaties to make her reveal the secret cause of her anguish; which at last Phaedra, contrary to decency and probability, is prevailed upon to do in presence of that very chorus (act ii. sc. 2.). Alcestes, in Euripides, at the point of death, is brought from the palace to the place of action, groaning and lamenting her untimely fate (act ii. sc. 1.). In the Trachiniae of Sophocles (act ii.), a secret is imparted to Dejanira, the wife of Hercules, in presence of the chorus. In the tragedy of Iphigenia, the messenger employed to inform Clytemnestra that Iphigenia was sacrificed, stops short at the place of action, and with a loud voice calls the queen from her palace to hear the news. Again, in the Iphigenia in Tauris (act iv.), the necessity of the chorus forces Euripides into a gross absurdity, which is to form a secret in their hearing; and, to dignify the absurdity, much care is paid to the chorus, not one woman but a number, to engage them to secrecy. In the Medea of Euripides, that princess makes no difficulty, in presence of the chorus, to plot the death of her husband, of his mistress, and of her father the king of Corinth, all by poison: it was necessary to bring Medea upon the stage; and there is but one place of action, which is always occupied by the chorus. This scene closes the second act; and in the end of the third, the frankly makes the chorus her confidants in plotting the murder of her own children. Terence, by identity of place, is often forced to make a conversation within doors be heard on the open street: the cries of a woman in labour are there heard distinctly.\n\nThe Greek poets are not less hampered by unity of time than by that of place. In the Hippolytus of Euripides, that prince is banished at the end of the fourth plan act; and in the first scene of the following act, a messenger relates to Theseus the whole particulars of the death of Hippolytus by the sea-monster: that remarkable event must have occupied many hours; and yet in the representation it is confined to the time employed by the chorus upon the stage at the end of the fourth act. The inconsistency is still greater in the Iphigenia in Tauris (act v. sc. 4.): the song could not exhaust half an hour; and yet the incidents supposed to have happened during that time could not naturally have been transacted in less than half a day.\n\nThe Greek artists are forced, not less frequently, to transgress another rule, derived also from a continued representation. The rule is, that as a vacancy, however momentary, interrupts the representation, it is necessary that the place of action be constantly occupied. Sophocles, with regard to that rule as well as to others, is generally correct: but Euripides cannot bear such restraint; he often evacuates the stage, and leaves it empty for others. Iphigenia in Tauris, after pronouncing a folioquy in the first scene, leaves the place of action, and is succeeded by Orestes and Pylades: they, after some conversation, walk off; and Iphigenia re-enters, accompanied with the chorus. In the Alcestes, which is of the same author, the place of action is void at the end of the third act. It is true, that to cover the irregularity, and to preserve the representation in motion, Euripides is careful to fill the stage without loss of time: but this fill is an interruption, and a link of the chain broken: for during the change of the actors, there must be a space of time, during which the stage is occupied by neither let. It makes indeed a more remarkable interruption, to change the place of action as well as the actors; but that was not practicable upon the Grecian stage.\n\nIt is hard to say upon what model Terence has formed his plays. Having no chorus, there is a pause in the representation at the end of every act: but advantage is not taken of the cessation, even to vary the place of action; for the street is always chosen, where everything passing may be seen by every person; and by that choice, the most striking and interesting parts of the action, which commonly pass within doors, are excluded.\nThe three Unities. He hath submitted to the like slavery with respect to time. In a word, a play with a regular chorus, is not more confined in place and time than his plays are. Thus a zealous sectary follows implicitly ancient forms and ceremonies, without once considering whether their introductory cause be still subsisting. Plautus, of a bolder genius than Terence, makes good use of the liberty afforded by an interrupted representation: he varies the place of action upon all occasions, when the variation suits his purpose.\n\nThe intelligent reader will by this time understand, that we plead for no change of place in our plays but after an interval, nor for any latitude in point of time but what falls in with an interval. The unities of place and time ought to be strictly observed during each act; for during the representation there is no opportunity for the smallest deviation from either. Hence it is an essential requisite, that during an act the stage be always occupied; for even a momentary vacancy makes an interval or interruption. Another rule is no less essential: it would be a gross breach of the unity of action to exhibit upon the stage two separate actions at the same time; and therefore, to preserve that unity, it is necessary that each personage introduced during an act be linked to those in possession of the stage, so as to join all in one action. These things follow from the very conception of an act, which admits not the slightest interruption: the moment the representation is intermitted, there is an end of that act; and we have no other notion of a new act, but where, after a pause or interval, the representation is again put in motion. French writers, generally speaking, are correct in this particular. The English, on the contrary, are so irregular as scarcely to deserve a criticism; actors not only succeed each other in the same place without connection, but, what is still less excusable, they frequently succeed each other in different places. This change of place in the same act ought never to be indulged; for, beside breaking the unity of the act, it has a disagreeable effect: after an interval, the imagination adapts itself to any place that is necessary, as readily as at the commencement of the play; but during the representation we reject change of place. From the foregoing censure must be excepted the Mourning Bride of Congreve, where regularity concurs with the beauty of sentiment and of language, to make it one of the most complete pieces England has to boast of. It is acknowledged, however, that in point of regularity this elegant performance is not altogether unexceptionable. In the four first acts, the unities of place and time are strictly observed: but in the last act, there is a capital error with respect to unity of place; for in the three first scenes of that act, the place of action is a room of state, which is changed to a prison in the fourth scene: the chain also of the actors is broken; as the persons introduced in the prison are different from those who made their appearance in the room of state. This remarkable interruption of the representation makes in effect two acts instead of one: and therefore, if it be a rule that a play ought not to consist of more acts than five, this performance is far defective in point of regularity. It may be added, that, even admitting six acts, the irregularity would not be altogether removed, without a longer pause in the representation than is allowed in the acting; for more than a momentary interruption is requisite for enabling the imagination readily to fall in with a new place, or with a wide space of time. In The Way of the World, of the same author, unity of place is preserved during every act, and a stricter unity of time during the whole play than is necessary.\n\n\u00a7 4. Of the Opera.\n\nAn opera is a drama represented by music. This entertainment was invented at Venice. An exhibition of a drama requires a most brilliant magnificence, and an experienced expense truly royal. The drama must necessarily be by music, composed in verse; for as operas are sung and accompanied with symphonies, they must be in verse to be properly applicable to music. To render this entertainment still more brilliant, it is ornamented with dances and ballets, with superb decorations, and surprising machinery. The dresses of the actors, of those who assist in the chorus, and of the dancers, being all in the most splendid and elegant taste, contribute to render the exhibition highly sumptuous. But notwithstanding this union of arts and pleasures at an immense expense, and notwithstanding a most dazzling pageantry, an opera appears, in the eyes of many people of taste, but as a magnificent absurdity, seeing that nature is never there from the beginning to the end. It is not our business here, however, to determine between the different tastes of mankind.\n\nThe method of expressing our thoughts by singing and music is so little natural, and has something in it forced and affected, that it is not easy to conceive how it could come into the minds of men of genius to represent any human action, and, what is more, a ferocious or tragic action, any otherwise than by speech. We have, it is true, operas in English by Addison, &c., in Italian by Metastasio, in French by M. Quinault, Fontenelle, &c., the subjects of which are so grave and tragic, that one might call them musical tragedies, and real chefs d'oeuvres in their kind. But though we are highly satisfied and greatly affected on reading them, and are much pleased with seeing them represented, yet the spectator is, perhaps, more charmed with the magnificence of the sight and the beauty of the music, than moved with the action and the tragical part of the performance. We are not, however, of that order of critics who strive to prove, that mankind act wrong in finding pleasure in an object with which they are really pleased; who blame a lover for thinking his mistress charming, when her features are by no means regular; Pietfield's and who are perpetually applying the rules of logic to the works of genius: we make these observations merely in order to examine if it be not possible to augment the pleasures of a polite people, by making the opera something more natural, more probable, and more consonant to reason.\n\nWe think, therefore, that the poet should never, or should take at least very rarely, choose a subject from history, but not from fable or mythology, or from the regions of enchantment. Every rational mind is constantly shocked from fable to hear a mutilated hero trill out, from the slender and enpipe of a chaffinch, To arms! To arms! and in the enchantment, tame tone animate his soldiers, and lead them to the assault; or harangue an assembly of grave senators, and sometimes a whole body of people. Nothing can be more\nmore burlesque than such exhibitions; and a man must be possessed of a very uncommon sensibility to be affected by them. But as we know not what was the language of the gods, and their manner of expressing themselves, we are at liberty in that case to form what illusions we please, and to suppose that they sung to distinguish themselves from mortals. Besides, all the magic of decorations and machinery become natural, and even necessary, in these kinds of subjects; and therefore readily afford opportunity for all the pomp of these performances. The chorus, the dances, the ballettes, the symphonies and dresses, may likewise be all made to correspond with such subjects, nothing is here affected, absurd, or unnatural. Whoever is possessed of genius, and is well acquainted with mythology, will there find an inexhaustible source of subjects highly diversified, and quite proper for the drama of an opera.\n\nWe shall not speak here of that sort of music which appears to us the most proper for such a drama, and of the several alterations of which we think it susceptible, in order to make it more complete, and to adapt it to a more pathetic, more noble, and more natural expression, as well in the recitatives as in the airs and chorus. (See Music.) We have only here to consider the business of the poet. He should never lose sight of nature, even in the midst of the greatest fiction. A god, a demi-god, a renowned hero, such as for example as Renaud in Armida, a fairy, a genius, a nymph, or fury, &c. should constantly be represented according to the characters we give them, and never be made to talk the language of a fop or a petite ma\u00eetresse. The recitative, which is the groundwork of the dialogue, requires verses that are free and not regular, such as with a simple cadence approach the nearest to common language. The airs should not be forced into the piece, nor improperly placed for the sake of terminating a scene, or to display the voice of a performer: they should express some sentiment, or some precept, short and striking, or tender and affecting; or some smile lively and natural; and they should arise of themselves from a monologue, or from a scene between two persons; prolixity should here be particularly avoided, especially when such an air makes part of a dialogue; for nothing is more insipid or disagreeable than the countenances of the other actors who appear at the same time, whose silence is quite unmeaning, and who know not what to do, with their hands and feet while the finger is straining his throat. The verse of all the airs should be of the lyric kind, and should contain some poetic image, or paint some noble passion, which may furnish the composer with an opportunity of displaying his talents, and of giving a lively and affecting expression to the music. A phrase that is inanimated can never have a good effect in the performance, but must become insipid and horribly tedious in the air. The trite similes of the Italians, of a stream that flows, or a bird that flies, &c. are no longer sufferable. The same thing may be said with regard to the chorus, which should be equally natural and well adapted: it is here sometimes a whole people, sometimes the inhabitants of a peculiar country, and sometimes warriors, nymphs, or priests, &c. who raise their voice to demand justice, to implore favour, or render a general homage. The action itself will furnish the poet of genius with ideas, words, and the manner of disposing them.\n\nLastly, the opera being a performance calculated less to satisfy the understanding than to charm the ear and affect the heart, and especially to strike the sight, the poet should have a particular attention to that object, should be skilled in the arts of a theatre, should know how to introduce combats, ballets, feats, games, pompous entries, solemn processions, and such marvellous incidents as occur in the heavens, upon earth, in the sea, and even in the infernal regions: but all these matters demand a strong character, and the utmost precision in the execution: for otherwise, the comic being a near neighbour to the sublime, they will easily become ridiculous. The unity of action must certainly be observed in such a poem, and all the incidental episodes must concur to the principal design; otherwise it would be a necessity of monstrous chaos. It is impossible, however, scrupulously to observe the unity of time and place: though the liberty, which reason allows the poet in this respect, is not without bounds; and the less use he makes of it, the more perfect his poem will be. It is not perhaps impossible so to arrange the objects, that, in changing the decorations, the painter may constantly make appear some part of the principal decoration which characterizes the situation of the scene, as the corner of a palace, at the end of a garden, or some avenue that leads to it, &c. But all this is liable to difficulties, and even to exceptions; and the art of the painter must concur in such case with that of the poet. For the rest, all the operas of Europe are at least one third too long; especially the Italian. The unity of action requires brevity, and satiety is inseparable from a division that lasts full four hours, and sometimes longer.\n\nThey have indeed endeavoured to obviate this inconvenience by dividing an opera into three, and even into five acts; but experience proves, that this division, though judicious, is still not sufficient to relieve the wearied attention.\n\nSect. II. Of Lyric Poetry.\n\nThe ode is very ancient, and was probably the first species of poetry. It had its source, we may suppose, the odes from the heart, and was employed to express, with becoming fervour and dignity, the grateful sense man entertained of the blessings which daily flowed from God the fountain of all goodness; hence their hallowed hymns, and other devotional compositions of that kind.\n\nBut in process of time it was employed, not only to praise the Almighty for bounties received, but to solicit his aid in time of trouble; as is plain from the odes written by King David and others, and collected by the Jewish Scribes into the book of Psalms, to be sung at their feasts, festivals, and on other solemn occasions. Nor was this practice confined to the Israelites only: other nations had their songs of praise and petitions of this sort, which they preferred to their deities in time of public prosperity and public distress, as well as to those heroes who distinguished themselves in arms. Even the American Indians, whose notions of religion are extremely confined, have their war-songs, which they sing to this day.\nIt is reasonable to suppose that the awful purpose to which the ode was applied, gave rise among the ancients to the custom of invoking the muses; and that the poets in order to raise their sentiments and language, so as to be acceptable to their deities, thought it expedient to solicit some divine assistance. Hence poets are said to have been inspired, and hence an unbounded liberty has been given to the ode; for the lyric poet, fired, as it were, with his subject, and borne away on the wings of gratitude, disdains grammatical niceties and common modes of speech, and often soars above rule, though not above reason. This freedom, however, confines chiefly in sudden transitions, bold digressions, and lofty excursions. For the ancient poets, and even Pindar, the most daring and lofty of them all, has in his sublimest flights, and amidst all his rapture, preferred harmony, and often uniformity in his versification; but so great is the variety of his measures, that the traces of immenseness are in a manner lost; and this is one of the excellencies for which that poet is admired, and which, though seemingly devoid of art, requires so much that he has seldom been imitated with success.\n\nThe ancients in their odes indulged such a liberty of fancy, that some of their best poets not only make bold excursions and digressions, but, having in their flights started some new and noble thought, they frequently pursue it, and never more return to their subject. But this loose kind of ode, which seems to reject all method, and in which the poet, having just touched upon his subject, immediately diverts to another, we should think blameable, were it lawful to call in question the authority of those great men who were our preceptors in this art. We may venture to affirm, however, that these compositions stand in no degree of comparison with other odes of theirs, in which, after wandering from the subject in pursuit of new ideas arising from some of its adjuncts, and ranging wantonly, as it were, through a variety of matter, the poet is from some other circumstance led naturally to his subject again; and, like a bee, having collected the essence of many different flowers, returns home, and unites them all in one uniform pleasing sweet.\n\nThe ode among the ancients signified no more than a song; but with the moderns, the ode and the song are considered as different compositions; the ode being usually employed in grave and lofty subjects, and seldom sung but on solemn occasions.\n\nThe subjects most proper for the ode and song, Horace has pointed out in a few elegant lines.\n\nGods, heroes, conquerors, Olympic crowns,\nLove's pleasing cares, and the free joys of wine,\nAre proper subjects for the lyric song.\n\nTo which we may add, that happiness, the pleasures of a rural life, and such parts of morality as afford lessons for the promotion of our felicity, and reflections on the conduct of life, are equally suitable to the ode. This both Pindar and Horace were so sensible of, that many of their odes are seasoned with these moral sentences and reflections.\n\nBut who can number ev'ry sandy grain\nWash'd by Sicilia's hoarse-refounding main?\n\nOr who can Theron's generous works express,\nAnd tell how many hearts his bounteous virtues blest?\n\nAnd in another Olympic ode, inscribed by the same poet to Diagoras of Rhodes (and in such esteem, that it was deposited in the temple of Minerva, written in letters of gold), Pindar, after exalting the gods, concludes with this lesson in life:\n\nYet as the gales of fortune various blow,\nTo-day tempestuous, and to-morrow fair,\nDue bounds, ye Rhodians, let your transports know;\nPerhaps to-morrow comes a storm of care.\n\nWolff's PINDAR.\n\nThe man resolv'd and steady to his trust,\nInflexible to ill, and obstinately just,\nMay the rude rabble's insolence despise,\nTheir senseless clamours and tumultuous cries;\nThe tyrant's fierceness he beguiles,\nAnd the stern brow and the harsh voice defies,\nAnd with superior greatness smiles.\n\nNot the rough whirlwind, that deforms\nAdria's black gulf, and vexes it with storms,\nThe stubborn virtue of his soul can move;\nNor the red arm of angry Jove,\nThat flings the thunder from the sky,\nAnd gives it rage to roar, and strength to fly,\nShould the whole frame of nature round him break,\nIn ruin and confusion hurl'd,\nHe unconcern'd would hear the mighty crack,\nAnd stand secure amidst a falling world.","sp":396,"ep":442},{"h":"STAHL REGARDS THE EXCRETIONS AS THE","t":"l regards the excretions as the means employed by nature to counteract the natural tendency of the body towards putrefaction. He believes that the animal humours are exceedingly disposed to thicken, and that the circulation of the blood is the means made use by nature to keep up their original fluidity. One of the causes that most favour the tendency of the humours to putrefaction, is plethora, to which nature opposes, sometimes the motion of the solids that distribute the blood; sometimes the hemorrhagic fluxes which unload the vascular system. These latter opinions are the principal foundations of what has been called the humoral pathology, which prevailed so long in most of our medical schools, and which, with certain modifications is still maintained in many parts of the continent.\n\nThe favourable impulse given to physical science in general, by the philosophical writings of Bacon and Newton, extended itself at length to physiology; and physiological writers became convinced that it was better to collect and arrange the facts that related to the economy of living beings, than to frame hypothetical systems concerning them. The honour of forming a rational digest of the phenomena of the animal economy was reserved for Haller, who perceived the importance of assembling under one view, the experiments, facts, and observations of preceding writers, and of substituting them in the place of hypothetical reasonings. He traced the plan of the immense edifice that he designed to construct in his Fifth Lines of Physiology, and executed it on a grand and extensive scale, in his Elements, in which he has brought together into a body of doctrine, as complete as could be expected in his time, all the materials of the science. He perceived the inconvenience of a too strict application of the laws of mechanical philosophy to the living system. He admitted an active force, which he considered as peculiar to the animal body, viz. irritability, which contains the reason or the experimental cause of muscular motion. He maintained that irritability should never be confounded with sensibility, and that the irritable fibre differs as much from the sensible fibre, as the function of motion from that of sensation. Lastly, in his Opera Minor, he lays down many new and important points of doctrine respecting the structure of our organs, and the mechanism of our functions; and he relates a number of experiments made on living animals, for the purpose of drawing from nature the secret of those phenomena which she appears most desirous to conceal. We owe to Haller some curious researches respecting the formation of bone, and the production of callus, as well as some important elucidations of the manner in which the embryo contained in the egg is developed, and passes through the successive stages of its organization. He has left us many experiments and details respecting the structure of the heart, the circulation of the blood, and the pulsation of the arteries; on the mechanism of the ribs, and the action of the intercostal muscles during respiration; on the differences between the sensible and irritable organs; on the action of the brain and nerves, &c.\nThe latter half of the 18th century is remarkable for many able physiologists, who will be admired by posterity, either for the acuteness of their genius, or the important improvements that they have made in the science. We may mention the names of Boreau, La Caze, Bonnet, Vicq d\u2019Azyr, Bichat, Dumas, and Cuvier in France; of Fontana and Spallanzani in Italy, and of Whytt, Cullen, Brown, and Darwin in Britain. We cannot pretend to enumerate all the opinions and discoveries of these celebrated men, but must content ourselves with giving a sketch of the three rival systems of Cullen, Brown, and Darwin, and a brief outline of the opinions of Bichat.\n\nThe physiological system of Cullen was founded chiefly on that of Hoffman. He placed the principle of the whole animal economy in the movement of the vital fluids, regulated by the fundamental laws of the nervous system. This notion of the vital fluids, according to him, originates in the nerves, and being almost always united in the fenestrum, is easily transmitted from one nervous part to another, as long as the medullary substance of the nerves continues in its natural state of life and continuity. The contraction of the moving fibres connected with the fenestral organs through the medium of the brain, is the direct effect of a movement that commences with those objects. It is on the contractility inherent in the moving fibres, excited by their own extension, by the application of various stimuli, and often by the immediate influence of the animal or nervous powers, that all the physical actions of a living being depend. He regards this contractile force as distinct from all those which are possessed by the simple solid, and the inorganic elastic parts of the body.\n\nOf the theory of Brown, we have given a sufficient detail under his life, and need not repeat it here.\n\nIt is not easy to give a compendious view of the system of Dr Darwin, that shall be intelligible to those who have not examined his celebrated work, the Zoonomia; but we shall endeavour to give as brief and perspicuous an account of it as possible. It is necessary first to notice the descriptions given of the terms to be employed, which are as follows.\n\nThe immediate organs of fenestrae are, by Dr Darwin, affected to consist, like the muscles, of moving fibres. The contractions of the muscles and of the organs of fenestrae are comprehended under what are called fibrous motions, in contradistinction to the fenestral motions, or the changes which occasionally take place in the fenestrum. By this latter term is understood, not only the medulla of the brain and nerves, but also at the same time that living principle or spirit of animation, which resides throughout the body, and which we perceive only in its effects. An idea is defined to be a motion of the fibres of some immediate organ of fenestrae; and hence is frequently termed also a fenestral motion. Perception comprehends both the fibrous motion or idea, and the attention to it. When the pain or pleasure arising from this motion and this attention produces other fibrous motion, it is termed fenestration; thus limiting this term to an active fenestrae. Ideas, not immediately excited by external objects, but which recur without them, are termed either, 1. Ideas of recollection, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards; or 2. Ideas of suggestion, as when we repeat it forwards, A suggesting B, B suggesting C, &c. from habit.\n\nAfter mentioning a number of experiments to prove the fibrous motions of the organs of fenestrae, Dr Darwin proceeds to lay down the following laws of animal causation.\n\n1. The fibres which constitute the muscles, and organs of fenestrae, possess a power of contraction. The circumstances attending the exertion of this power of contraction constitute the laws of animal motion, as the circumstances attending the exertion of the power of attraction constitute the laws of inanimate matter.\n\n2. The spirit of animation is the immediate cause of the contraction of animal fibres. It resides in the brain and nerves, and is liable to general or partial diminution or accumulation.\n\n3. The stimulus of bodies external to the moving organ is the remote cause of the original contractions of animal fibres.\n\n4. A certain quantity of stimulus produces irritation, which is an exertion of the spirit of animation exciting the fibres to contraction.\n\n5. A certain quantity of contraction of animal fibres, if it be perceived at all, produces pleasure; a greater or less quantity of contraction, if it be perceived at all, produces pain. These constitute sensation.\n\n6. A certain quantity of sensation produces desire or aversion. These constitute volition.\n\n7. All animal motions which have occurred at the same time or in immediate succession, become connected, that when one of them is reproduced, others have a tendency to accompany or succeed it. When fibrous contractions succeed or accompany other fibrous contractions, the connection is termed association; when fibrous contractions succeed fenestral motions, the connection is termed causation; when fibrous and fenestral motions reciprocally introduce each other, it is termed catenation of animal motions. All these connections are said to be produced by habit; that is, by frequent repetition. These laws of animal causation are, according to our author, evinced by numerous facts, which occur in our daily exertions, and are employed by him to explain the diseases and decay of the animal system.\n\nThe four fenestral powers, upon which all the actions or motions depend, are thus characterized:\n\nIrritation is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the fenestrum, residing in the muscles or organs of fenestrae, in consequence of the appulses of external bodies.\n\nSensation is an exertion or change of the central parts of the fenestrum, or the whole of it, beginning in some of those extreme parts of it, which reside in the muscles or organs of fenestrae.\n\nVolition is an exertion or change of the central parts of the fenestrum, or of the whole of it, terminating in some of those extreme parts of it which reside in the muscles or organs of fenestrae.\n\nAssociation is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the fenestrum, residing in the muscles or organs of fenestrae, in consequence of some antecedent or attendant fibrous contractions.\n\nTo these four faculties correspond so many classes of fibrous contractions, named irritative, sensitive, voluntary, and associative. But all muscular motions, and all ideas, are originally irritative, and become causable by fenestration and volition from habit, i.e. because pleasure or pain, or desire or aversion, have accompanied them;\nthose ideas or muscular motions which have been frequently excited together, ever afterwards have a tendency to accompany each other.\n\nOf these motions the associate seem most to have excited Dr. Darwin's attention. He divides them into three kinds; irritative affections, as when any part of the extracted heart of a frog is irritated by puncture, the whole heart contracts regularly; sensitive affections, or the trains or tribes of motions established by pain or pleasure; and voluntary affections, or those produced by volition.\n\nThe activity of this power of volition is supposed to form the great difference between man and the brute creation; the means of producing pleasure and avoiding pain given to man by this power being denied to brutes.\n\nCorresponding to these four classes of motions, there are four classes of ideas; irritative, preceded by irritation; sensitive, preceded by the sensation of pleasure or pain; voluntary, preceded by voluntary exertion; and associate, preceded by other ideas or muscular motions.\n\nIt has been observed in Hudibras that\n\n\"A rhetorician's rules\nServe nothing but to name his tools.\"\n\nSo we find that a considerable part of Darwin's work is taken up in establishing the new meaning which he attaches to terms well understood and long adopted.\n\nWe cannot enter more fully at present into the opinions of the Zoonomia, but we shall have occasion to notice some of them in the succeeding part of this article.\n\nBichat's system, which has made so much noise on the continent, is chiefly founded on the division of life into two kinds, organic and animal; the former of which is common to all organized beings, while the latter, as its name imports, is peculiar to animals. Each of these two kinds of life may be considered as composed of two orders of functions, which succeed each other in an inverse order. The first of these feries in animal life commences with external objects, and proceeds towards the brain; the second begins in the brain, and is thence propagated to the organs of motion and voice. In the first order of functions, the animal is passive; in the second he is active. External objects act on the body through the medium of the first; by the second, the body reacts on external objects.\n\nTwo kinds of motion take place in organic life. In the first the formation of the body is constantly going on; in the second there is a constant decomposition; hence the elements of the body are continually changing, while the organization continues the same. Organic life is accommodated to the continual circulation of matter. The one order of functions assimilates to the nature of the animal, the nutritious particles received into the system; the other rejects what is useless, or is so much altered as to become noxious. The assimilating order of functions consists of digestion, circulation, respiration, and nutrition; all of which processes the matter received into the body must undergo, before it can become a part of the animal substance. When it has for some time constituted a part of the body, it is taken up by absorption, conveyed into the circulation, and thrown out thence, by cutaneous or pulmonary exhalation, or by some other emanations. Hence, the second order of organic functions, or dissimilating functions, consist of absorption, circulation, exhalation, secretion, and excretion. The brain is the centre of animal life; the heart of organic life.\n\nBichat considers the proper balance of life to be preserved by the proportion which exists between the action of surrounding bodies, and the reaction of the system. This reaction is greatest in youth, hence the principle of life is at that time in excess. It is least in old age, and then the vital principle is defective. The measure of life is therefore the difference which exists between the efforts of external powers to overturn life, and the internal resistance to support it. The excess of the former shows the weakness of life; that of the latter indicates its strength.\n\nThe following table exhibits Bichat's distribution of the organs, or, as he calls them, apparatus, belonging to animal and organic life, and to generation, which is common to both.\n\nI.

It has taught us that the prevailing spirit of every age has had a marked influence on the productions both of art and science that have appeared during that period; and that physiology has always been impressed with the character of the science that was most prevalent at any particular period. While the doctrines of Aristotle prevailed in the schools, physiology never extended beyond the bounds that had been set to it by Galen; and the belief in occult qualities universally prevailed. When a taste for metaphysical speculations began to gain ground, this science was given over to the most abstract futilities and absurd fictions. When Descartes had reformed the principles of the ancient philosophy, the study of the animal economy, like all the other branches of physics, was fettered by the trammels of the Cartesian doctrines. After the genius of philosophers was directed to chemistry, physiology also took a chemical turn, which it quitted only to take a new direction pointed out to it by the taste for mathematics and mechanical philosophy, which prevailed among all the literary at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century; and now that the study of chemistry is become so general, we see that physiologists are for reducing the functions of the animal economy to the analytical and synthetical operations of the laboratory, and converting the living body into a furnace where a constant combustion is going on while life remains.\n\nWe are now to enter on the phenomena of life, and the functions of organized beings; and here we must premise, that in our illustration of these phenomena and functions we shall occasionally refer to every class of living creatures; it being our object rather to give a comparative view of physiology in general, than to confine our remarks to the human economy in particular. Indeed much of the physiology of man has already been given under Anatomy and Medicine; and of that of the inferior animals, we have treated of the physiology of the order Cete under Cetology; of that of Reptiles under Herpetology; of that of Fishes under Ichthyology; of that of Serpents under Ophiology.\n\nChap. I. Of the General Phenomena of Life.\n\nWhen we take a general view of the objects of nature, we see that they differ from each other in many idea of life. important particulars, and we soon find that they may be conveniently divided into two great classes; one capable of growth, nourishment, and reproduction; the other not susceptible of these changes. We perceive that all those substances which are found in the bowels of the earth, and many of those which appear upon its surface, continue for an indefinite time in the same circumstances, until they are acted on by each other, when they undergo certain changes which entirely alter their nature and former properties.\n\nSulphur, in its natural state, is a solid substance insoluble in water, and possessing little activity when applied to the human skin; but if it be subjected to the action of heat, in contact with atmospheric air, or any other gas containing oxygen, it becomes a fluid, very miscible with water, and of a most corrosive quality, namely sulphuric acid. The hydrogenous gas found in the upper part of mines, would remain for ever uncombined with the oxygenous gas which forms part of the atmosphere in which it floats, were it not subjected to the action of caloric, or electricity in a very concentrat-\ned slate; but as soon as either of these agents comes in contact with the mechanical mixture of gales, a combination takes place, attended with a tremendous explosion, and the hydrogenous gas disappears.\n\nWe find that all the bodies to which we give the name of minerals, possess no power in themselves which can enable them to resist the operation of external agents; each individual of them is composed of a small number of principles, and their texture appears to be made up of independent particles. Every other body in nature, comprehending the almost infinite variety of plants and animals, though under certain circumstances subject to the same changes which take place among minerals, have, when these circumstances do not exist, an innate property by which they are enabled to resist the production of these changes. They do indeed undergo certain alterations, but by these their original habit and essential properties are not changed. From the time that a plant springs from the seed, till it ceases to vegetate, it is perpetually receiving an accession of new matter, and giving out a part of its former composition: but the new matter is assimilated to it, and becomes a part of the plant; the identity of the plant is preserved, though its component parts are perpetually changing. The same in a still higher degree takes place in animals. The individuals of this latter class, comprehending plants and animals, possess peculiar structure, very different from that of the former. Their texture is fibrous, and the fibres arranged and interwoven, so as to form parts called organs, by means of which they carry on certain operations or functions necessary for their preservation, or for the reproduction of the species. Hence these have been called organized bodies, while the others have been denominated brute or inorganic matter. See NATURAL HISTORY, No. 7.\n\nThe component principles of organized beings are much more numerous in each individual than those of inorganic matter, though their absolute number in the former class is smaller than in the latter. In order to present, under a compendious point of view, the distinguishing characteristics of these two classes of beings, we shall give the following table:\n\n| Mobility, | Repose, | Aggregation, | Cohesion, | Gravitation, | Condensation, | Dilatation, | Combination, | Dissolution. |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n|           |        |             |          |             |              |            |             |             |\n\nRefolvable into\n\n| Inertia, | Impulsion, | Attraction, | Affinity. |\n|----------|------------|-------------|----------|\n\n| Impression, | Sensation, | Perception, | Affection, | Sympathy, | Action, | Locomotion, | Digestion, | Circulation, | Respiration, | Assimilation, | Accretion, | Reproduction. |\n|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|\n|            |            |             |           |           |         |            |            |               |              |                |           |             |\n\nRefolvable into four general forces\n\n| Sensitive, | Motive, | Assimilative, | Vital resistance. |\n|------------|--------|---------------|------------------|\n\nThe differences that are found to prevail between Effects of organized beings and inorganic matter, have always been attributed to something of a superior nature, called vitality or life. This term life forms one of those simple ideas which it is difficult to define, and as all understand the meaning of the expression, a definition is the least necessary; but if it be required, it cannot be expressed more accurately than in the language of Bichat, who calls life the sum of those functions which resist death. In short, life is best described by the effects produced on a body while it resides in it, contrasted with the appearances which take place in the same body when life is no longer present.\n\nOne of the most general effects of the presence of life is, as we have said, the resistance which living beings make by it enabled to oppose to the operation of external agents; and this is most remarkably seen with respect to temperature. Every living being possesses, in a greater or lesser degree, the power of preserving nearly a uniform temperature, which is always a few degrees greater than that of the medium in which it lives. In plants, this power seems to exist but in a low degree. Some of the lower animals which inhabit the air, particularly insects, possess it much more completely. The great heat generated in a hive of bees is a familiar illustration of this. In birds this property is very remarkable, the heat of their bodies being greater than that of any other species of animals. The heat of fishes, worms, and of most reptiles, very little exceeds the temperature of the medium in which they reside; but when the water in which fishes live is frozen, they are capable of resisting, for a long time, the consequences of the diminished temperature. The power which many animals possess of resisting high degrees of heat without any considerable increase of their own temperature, seems still more remarkable, and probably led to the fable of the salamander, which was supposed able to endure the heat of fire, and even extinguish it, when thrown into it for that purpose.\n\nLife seems to pervade almost every part of a living Degrees of being. In animals, every part except the cuticle, hair, vitality, and nails, exhibit marks of vitality; but it seems to be distributed...\ndistributed through those parts in a different manner in the various tribes of organized beings. In plants, and in a few of the inferior animals, as the zoophyta, it seems to exist independently in almost every part. A bud, flip, or sucker, torn from the parent plant, and inserted within the bark of another plant, or placed within the earth, in favourable circumstances, vegetates, increases, and in due time becomes a perfect plant, in all respects similar to the parent stock. If a polypus be cut in pieces, each piece lives and grows, till it becomes itself a complete polypus. If a worm be cut in two, so as to leave one part with the head, and the other with the tail, each part becomes a perfect worm, possessing both head and tail. As we ascend, however, in the scale of beings, we find life less equally and independently diffused. A part cut or torn from the body of most animals quickly loses its vitality; but this is lost sooner in some animals than in others. The head of a turtle or a snake is able to bite many hours or even days, after it is severed from the body; and in the former instance, the animal seems for a long time to experience little inconvenience from its loss. The heart of a frog is seen to move many hours after it is cut out.\n\nThe principal effects of the presence of life appear in the exercise of those functions or actions by which living beings preserve their existence, or reproduce their like.\n\nOne of the most general properties of organized beings is that susceptibility to motion, which is called irritability, which appears essential to life, and is possessed, in a greater or lesser degree, by every class of organized beings. The motions of plants are sometimes very remarkable, and approach very nearly to those which take place in animals. The stamens of the *cistus helianthemum* are seen to move in various directions when the sun shines on them; the leaves of the *mimosa pudica* (sensitive plant), when touched by the hand, or when irritated by the alighting of an insect on them, immediately contract; the *dionaea muscipula* (Venus's fly-trap), when a fly touches its leaves, closes the thorny fringes with which they are beset, on the presumptuous insect, and crushes it to death; but the motions of the *herbarium gyrans* are the most remarkable of all those that take place in plants. The leaves of this extraordinary vegetable are seen in constant motion through the greatest part of the day, without the intervention of any apparent external impulse; and even when a branch is cut off and kept in water, the motion of the leaves continues for many hours together. All the plants which grow above the earth, expose their leaves and flowers to the warm sunlight, and when situated in a place which is supplied by light only from one quarter, they gradually direct their branches towards that part by which the light enters. In stormy weather they retract their leaves, and fold up their flowers, and when confined in the dark, their branches retain the position which they had when last exposed to the light.\n\nThe motions of many of the lower animals, though sufficiently apparent, are more obscure than those of plants. A muscle or an oyster seems to possess little more motion than is necessary to open and close the valves of its shell, and, no more than plants, has the faculty of conveying itself from place to place. This faculty of locomotion, which in all the higher classes of animals is dependent on the will, will be fully considered in the second chapter.\n\nThe function which appears to be most universally diffused in living beings, is digestion, (including nutrition) or that by which the substances intended for their nourishment are assimilated to the nature of the body which they enter. This function varies considerably in the different classes. Plants merely attract water from the earth in which they grow; by means of the fibrous parts of their roots, whence it is conveyed by innumerable capillary vessels throughout the whole plant, in which it appears partly to be decomposed, and partly to remain in the state of water, diluting some of the vegetable principles, and thus forming the juices of the plant. In some of the inferior animals, digestion seems to be almost the only function which they are capable of performing. Thus, many of the zoophytes, as the polypi, appear to be almost entirely composed of a stomach, resembling the finger of a glove, into which the aliment is received, the nutritive part extracted, and the excrementitious part thrown out by the same opening. In most other animals, the alimentary canal has two distinct openings, one for the reception of the food, and the other for the ejection of the excrement.\n\nBy some animals the food is swallowed entire, and digestion is performed by a simple solution or trituration in the stomach; while in others the mouth is furnished with teeth, or other hard parts, capable of reducing the aliment to a pulpy state, in order to render its further digestion more easy and expeditious. In most animals, the food having undergone some change in the digestive organs, is taken up from them by certain very minute vessels, and carried to every part of the body; but in some it appears rather to exude through pores in the sides of the alimentary canal.\n\nThe function of circulation, by which the fluids are constantly moved through every part of the body, is not so general as either of the former functions. In plants there is no proper circulation; for although there are numerous vessels by which water enters into the substance of the plant, and in which the peculiar juices of the vegetable move, the motions of these fluids are not uniform, and do not tend towards one centre. The same defective circulation appears in many of the inferior animals, as in zoophytes and insects. As we rise, however, to the higher classes, we find a perfect circulation. In these there is always a peculiar organ from which the fluids are conveyed to the rest of the body, and to which they again return in a perpetual round. In some animals this central organ is single, while in others it consists of two similar organs joined together, from one of which the whole of the fluids proceed through one particular organ in a lesser circulation, and thence return to the other part, before they are distributed to the general system.\n\nAll organized beings require more or less the presence of atmospheric air for their subsistence, or at least for the due performance of the vital functions. In some, the agency of this fluid is conveyed merely by pores upon the surface; as in plants, in which the leaves absorb the air; and in several of the inferior animals, as insects and worms, over the surface of whose bodies are distributed numerous openings, by which the air enters. In animals of the higher orders there are peculiar organs, called...\ncalled lungs or gills, through which air, or water containing air, enters, and from which its beneficial influence is imparted to the fluids which are circulating through them. In general, these beings exist for a very short time, when deprived of atmospheric air, or when the element in which they live is deprived of oxygen; but in some of the lower classes of animals the absence of oxygen is much less injurious; and there are instances of reptiles in particular having been preserved in a state susceptible of life and motion, while buried for many years in the heart of a tree, or in the middle of a block of stone. Respiration, then, though in general necessary to the continuance of vitality, may, in many tribes of organized beings, be suspended for a considerable time, without the principle of life being entirely destroyed.\n\nA function equally general, and equally indispensable with that of digestion, and one which forms another characteristic of living beings, is the function of regeneration, a function more peculiarly necessary, as all organized beings, though capable of resisting for a considerable time the operation of external agents, tend ultimately to corruption and decay; and as they cannot, like inorganic matter, be regenerated by a reunion of their component principles, it was necessary that they should possess the capacity of producing, while in existence, a creature similar to themselves, to supply their place in the scale of being.\n\nIt has been a very general opinion among naturalists, that all living beings, both plants and animals, originate from seeds or eggs produced by the parent. This, although very generally true, is not a universal fact. Most plants, indeed, with which we are acquainted, appear capable, in their natural state, of producing seeds, which form the embryo of a future plant. But in a great many of them new plants are obtained from buds, slips, or suckers, furnished by the parent. In some animals too, as the polypus, reproduction may be effected by dividing the parent into several pieces; and even the natural generation of these animals is performed by protuberances which grow from the body of the parent, and seem to drop off spontaneously, when capable of an independent existence.\n\nThere are two striking differences in the manner by which living beings are generated. In some, two distinct sets of organs are necessary, and by the mutual action of these generation is effected; while in others, as in the instances we have mentioned of the polypus, this act of copulation appears to be unnecessary. Almost all plants possess distinct sexual organs, and in most both male and female organs are situated in the same individual. In these plants the female ovum is impregnated by a very fine powder, which is contained in part of the male organs, and is applied to those of the female. We are fully convinced of the necessity of the vegetable copulation, by observing that the females of those plants which have the sexual organs situated in distinct individuals are not capable of producing fruit, or at least do not produce this in perfection, if they are excluded from the influence of the male; and that an artificial impregnation may be brought about by bringing the male and female organs in contact. Many animals are hermaphrodite; and among these the individuals of some species generate without the assistance of another individual of the same species. This appears to be the case with the bivalve shell-fish. Others again, as snails, and most of the mollusca, which crawl upon the earth, copulate reciprocally, or each individual performs the double office of male and female. In most animals, however, the sexes are distinct, and probably a real hermaphrodite in the superior classes never existed. Another striking difference with respect to generation in animals is the more or less perfect state in which they bring forth their young. A large proportion of animals, among which are the insect tribe, fishes and birds, produce eggs, which are afterwards hatched by the heat of the parent, or by that of the sun. Other classes again, as some of the amphibia, and the whole of the mammalia, carry their young for a certain time within an organ destined for that purpose, from which they are excluded in the state of perfect animals.\n\nThe last function which we shall here notice, is senescence. This appears to be less general than any which we have hitherto mentioned. It has indeed been supposed by many philosophers and naturalists, that plants possess a degree of sensibility; and this opinion has been lately avowed and strenuously supported by the elegant, but enthusiastic author of the Botanic Garden, and the Loves of the Plants. That plants possess a susceptibility of receiving impressions, and in consequence of that of being roused into action by external stimuli, we shall readily admit, and shall hereafter assign to this susceptibility its due importance; but as there is no reason to believe that it ever produces senescence, we must not confound it with the sensibility of animals; nor is the difficulty of explaining some of the functions of vegetables, without referring to the hypothesis of a vegetable nervous system, a sufficient reason for investing them with this faculty. It has even been doubted whether some of the inferior animals, as the zoophytes, possess this function, as nervous fibres have not yet been detected in their organization. It is probable, that there is a regular gradation in the tribes of organized beings with respect to senescence, as well as the other functions; and though we have not been able to discover all the links of this chain, these will probably, as our knowledge of nature increases, come more into view, and we shall then be able to reconcile many circumstances which we cannot at present comprehend.\n\nWith respect to the varieties that take place in the number and degree of the external senses, as possessed by the various classes of animals, we may refer the reader to what has been said on that subject in the first chapter of the comparative part of the article Anatomy.\n\nThe duration of life is exceedingly various. We know that there are animals which live but a few hours, as the insects called ephemerae; and that others, as the elephant, the raven, and the pike, may exist for a century. The term of life allotted to plants is also various; some live only for a year, and are hence called annual plants; others exist for two years, and are called biennial plants; while a few surpass in longevity anything with which we are acquainted in animated nature. Thus, the oak is said to require 100 years, in order to acquire its full maturity; to retain its perfect vigour for the like term, and to complete at least a third century before it entirely decays. The chestnut is a still more remarkable instance of vegetable longevity. The account of the gigantic chestnut on Mount Athos, given by\nGeneral by Brydone and other travellers, which has existed for many centuries, must be familiar to most of our readers.\n\nWe have hitherto considered life as displayed in the exercise of functions; but it may exist independently of this exercise, or it may lie dormant for a considerable time, till called into action by particular circumstances.\n\nEvery one knows how long a feed or an egg, when excluded from heat, air, and moisture, will retain the faculty of producing a plant or an animal. The only proof we have, that this faculty still exists, is that when we place the feed or the egg in circumstances favourable to the development of the embryo which it contains, the process of generation goes on, till the plant or the animal is excluded. We know also, that after an organized being has commenced the exercise of its functions, this exercise may cease for a time, or at least become almost imperceptible, while yet the vital power shall remain susceptible of reviving its activity at a future period. We then say that the animal or vegetable is in a torpid state. On this part of the history of life we shall not enter at present, but shall defer the consideration of it till we come to treat of sleep and death.\n\nThe above is a hasty comparative sketch of the functions exercised by the various tribes of organized beings. It is sufficient to show, that there is in these beings a vital power which completely distinguishes them from brute or inorganic matter.\n\nA question which naturally arises in every thinking mind is, What is the essence of life, or on what does it depend? Though we profess ourselves unable to answer this question in a satisfactory manner, and believe that all who have hitherto attempted to do so, have failed in their attempts, it may be acceptable to most of our readers to know the opinions of the most respectable writers on this abstruse subject. These, therefore, we shall briefly state.\n\nThese opinions have chiefly rested on the question, whether life be an independent, immaterial principle, or merely a physical or chemical modification of matter. We have already, in the historical view which we have given of the progress of physiology, mentioned some of the more remarkable doctrines respecting the principle of life that have been delivered prior to the 18th century; we shall here, therefore, only mention those which have been maintained since that time.\n\nMr John Hunter, in his valuable treatise on the blood, supposes the principle of vitality to exist in that fluid, or that the blood has life; and has founded this doctrine chiefly on the following proofs. First, It unites living parts, when it is effused between them. Secondly, It becomes vascular like other living parts; its temperature as it flows from the vessel, is always equal in the most opposite temperature in which the body can bear exposure. Thirdly, It is capable of being acted upon by a stimulus, as is the case when it coagulates. Fourth, Paralytic limbs, though deprived of motion and sensation, are yet nourished and preserved alive by the blood circulating through them.\n\nMr Hunter's idea of the vitality of the blood is merely the revival of one of the oldest physiological doctrines on record; namely, that delivered to the Israelites by Moses, that in the blood is the life of an animal.\n\nDr Goodwin, in his work on the connection of life with respiration, is of opinion, that the heart is the great seat of the principle of life in all the more perfect animals; and that the contractions of the heart with the ordinary stimulus is the only mark of the presence of this principle; that when the heart contracts under such circumstances, the body is alive; when not, it is dead.\n\nLife he therefore defines to be the faculty of propelling the fluids through the circulatory system. According to him, the external concomitant circumstances which operate upon the body in health are heat and respiration, which excite the vital principle to action; and whenever the functions of an animal are suddenly suspended, and the body puts on the appearance of death, it is always in our power to determine whether it be really dead, by restoring the temperature, and by inflating the lungs with proper air. He is of opinion, with some others, that there are no means of determining the absolute deprivation of the vital principle but by the presence of putrefaction.\n\nIt has lately become fashionable to consider life as the consequence of certain chemical changes, which are going on in the body; an opinion which is chiefly supported by Hufeland, Girtanner, and Humboldt.\n\nAccording to Hufeland, life is a chemic-animal flame, Hufeland, to the production of which oxygen is absolutely necessary, and the vital power is the most general and powerful of all the powers of nature. He considers it as the cause of organization, and as possessing the following properties.\n\n1. It has a greater affinity to some organized bodies than to others; thus, the polypus may be cut in pieces without being deprived of it, and a decapitated tortoise or a frog deprived of its heart will live a long time after; whilst to the human body, or a quadruped, it would be instant death. According to this physiologist, it is a general rule, that the stronger the affinity between life and an organized being, the more imperfect is the animal; hence the zoophytes, whose whole organization consists in a mouth, a stomach, and a gut, have a life exceedingly tenacious, and difficult to be destroyed.\n\n2. It is in greater quantity in some organized bodies than in others. In general, cold-blooded animals live longer than those with warm blood.\n\n3. It frees bodies from the chemical laws of inanimate matter, and transfers the component parts of a body from the physical or chemical to the organic or living world.\n\n4. It prevents putrefaction, for no organized body can putrefy unless deprived of life.\n\nHumboldt is of opinion, that the degree of vitality Humboldt depends upon the reciprocal balance of the chemical affinities of all the elementary parts of which the animal body is composed.\n\nSome physiologists of the present day deny the existence of the vital principle altogether. \"The idea of life,\" says Cuvier, \"is one of those general and obscure ideas produced in us by observing a certain series of phenomena, positing mutual relations, and succeeding each other in a constant order. We know not indeed the nature of the link that unites these phenomena, but we are sensible that a connection must exist; and this conviction is sufficient to induce us to give it a name, which the vulgar are apt to regard as the sign of a particular principle, though in fact that name can only indicate the totality of the phenomena which have occasioned its formation.\"\n\nDr Ferrar, in his observations concerning the vital principle, thinks, that some direct arguments may be brought\nbrought against the general supposition of an independent living principle. These arguments he divides into two kinds, viz. refutations of the general proofs offered in support of the vital principle; and instances of the direct influence of the mind and brain over what is termed the independent living principle. The great proofs for the support of a vital principle are, the contraction of muscles separated from the body on the application of stimulants; the performance of the vital and involuntary motions without any exertion or even consciousness of the mind, and the birth of full-grown fetuses defective of a brain. In all these cases, something is alleged to operate, independently of the mind, in producing muscular motion.\n\nDr Ferrier, in answer to the first argument drawn from the contraction of separated muscles, affirms, it may be said, viz., That the power of contraction, in a separate muscle, is lost before putrefaction takes place, i.e. before the destruction of its texture; but if its vitality depended on its texture, this ought not to happen. Secondly, The power of contraction, in a separated muscle, is strongest upon its first separation, and becomes weaker by degrees; therefore, the contracting power seems to have been derived from some source from which it is detached by the excision of the part. Thirdly, Irritation of the medulla oblongata, or of the nerves supplying particular muscles, occasions stronger contractions than irritation of the muscles themselves; and Dr Whytt furnishes an experiment on a frog, directly proving, that the action of separated muscles depends upon the nervous energy. Fourthly, Dr Haller himself is obliged to make on this subject a concession sufficient to destroy his favorite hypothesis of the vis insita. Fifthly, When a paralytic limb is convulsed by the electric shock, the motion never takes place without the patient's consciousness. In this case there is no diffusion between the vital principle, and that exertion which in voluntary motion is always attributed to the mind. See Chap. iii.\n\nIn answer to the second argument, in favour of a vital principle, drawn from the performances of the vital and other involuntary motions, Dr Ferrier contents himself with only observing, that, allowing the organs of those motions to be supplied with nervous energy, their motions may be very well accounted for by the stimulus of their contained fluids.\n\nThe force of the third argument, drawn from the want of a brain in full-grown fetuses, is taken off by Dr Whytt, who remarks, that as the heart is sometimes wanting in full-grown fetuses, the argument would equally prove, that the heart is not necessary for the continuance of circulation, as that the brain is not necessary to the support of the system. Accordingly, fetuses born without a brain do not, in general, survive birth.\n\nBesides the general supposition of an independent living principle, an inference has been drawn from facts, of a nervous energy independent of the brain. By this term is meant, that condition derived from the brain to different parts of the body, by means of which they become capable of motion. To show, by direct proof, that there is no independent vital principle; Dr Ferrier observes, 1. That it is justly urged by Dr Monro against the doctrine of the vis insita, that there is too much design in the actions of different muscles, affected by different stimuli, to be the effect of mere mechanism. Thus, when the hand or foot is burnt, or otherwise suddenly injured, the muscles on the part immediately stimulated are not thrown into action, nor the muscles on the side irritated, but their antagonists contract immediately, and strongly. Now, if the instantaneous action be in this case chiefly produced by an effort of the mind, the supposition of a distinct vital principle is superfluous; if it be said to be produced by a living power independent of the mind, then there must be a rational power in the body independent of the mind, which is absurd. 2. The state of the vital and involuntary motions is considerably affected by the state of the mind, which equally disproves the existence of a separate vital principle, and proves the dependence of the nervous energy upon the brain. 3. Madness, it is well known, is frequently produced by causes purely mental, and in persons apparently in good health; and, as the patient's sensibility to very powerful stimuli is much diminished in maniacal cases, they afford another proof of the subordination of the nervous energy. 4. It has been observed, that in paralytic cases, motion is frequently destroyed, while sensation remains. As the cause of palsy almost always resides in the brain, this fact appears equally inexplicable on the opinion of a distinct living principle, or of a nervous energy, independent of the brain. 5. When nerves are regenerated, after being cut through, sensation and voluntary motion are not always restored to the parts beneath the division: the restoration was never made in Dr Monro's experiments. But, on the supposition of a distinct nervous power, the nerve, after its reunion, ought to resume all its offices. 6. Dr Whytt affirms, that when the spinal marrow of a frog is destroyed, after decapitation, no contraction can be excited in the limbs, by cutting or tearing the muscles. Such are the facts and arguments which Dr Ferrier brings against the opinion of a distinct living principle; and he thinks, that their investigation appears to lead us back to the brain as the source of sensibility and irritability.\n\nIn the life of Dr John Brown, we have given an account of the doctrine, of life being a forced state. This doctrine appears to have been first delivered by Dr Cullen, though he afterwards retracted it. Of late Dr Rush of Philadelphia, in his Lectures on animal life, has advanced many arguments in favour of this doctrine. He includes, in animal life, three properties as applied to the human body, viz. motion, sensation, and thought; and these, when united, compose perfect life. It may exist without thought or sensation; but neither sensation nor thought can exist without motion. He affirms, that the lowest degree of life exists even in the absence of motion. He first considers animal life as it appears in the waking and sleeping state, in a healthy adult; and afterwards inquires into the modification of its causes in the fetal, infant, youthful and middle states of life, in certain diseases, in different states of society, and in different animals, and lays down the following propositions:\n\n1. Every part of the human body, the nails and hair excepted, is endowed with sensibility or excitability, or with both.\n\n2. The whole body is so formed and connected, that impressions made in the healthy state upon one part excite\nexcite motion or sensation, or both, in every other part of the body.\n\n3. Life is the effect of certain stimuli acting upon the sensibility and excitability, which are extended in different degrees to every external and internal part of the body; and these stimuli are as necessary to its existence as air is to flame.\n\nHe continues to observe, that the action of the brain, the diastole and systole of the heart, the pulsation of the arteries, the contraction of the muscles, the peristaltic motion of the bowels, the absorbing power of the lymphatics, secretion, excretion, hearing, feeling, smelling, taste, and the sense of touch, even thought itself, are all the effects of stimuli acting upon the organs of sense and motion.\n\nThese have been divided into external and internal.\n\n1. The external are light, sound, colours, air, heat, exercise, and the pleasures of the senses.\n\n2. The internal stimuli are food, drinks, chyle, blood, tension of the glands which contain secreted liquids, and the exercise of the faculties of the mind.\n\nLife, therefore, (according to the hypothesis of Ruth,) even thought itself, is merely a quality residing in the component parts of a material system, dependent upon a peculiar organization, by which it is enabled to act, or in some ways to move, on being stimulated or excited.\n\nHence life can never be inherent in a simple uncompounded substance, nor in a particle of animal matter; and if the stimulus be withheld from a living system beyond a given time, all motion, sensation, and thought, must necessarily be extinguished.\n\nInstead of one vital principle, some physiologists have supposed the existence of several in the same body; and from the phenomena that take place in some organized beings, as the reunion of parts that had been separated, the reproduction of others that have been lost, and the separate existence of the divided parts of some worms and zoophytes, it was formerly the opinion of a celebrated lecturer on anatomy, that the vital principle was really divided. From more considerate and extensive inquiry, however, he is now of opinion, that the irritability on which these phenomena depend, is never the direct or immediate operation of the vital principle, but only the consequence of its operation; and in no case exclusively the consequence, but the consequence likewise of other operations proceeding from a number of different causes; and hence it is that a vital principle may often exist where it cannot operate in a sensible manner, from the want of auxiliaries; and hence it is, likewise, that its effects may often be continued, at least for a while after its departure.\n\nWith regard to the portions of plants and polypi that continue to live in a separate state, assume the form of their respective species, and propagate their kind, they will be found, on a close examination, to have been originally complete systems; many of the plants and many of the polypi that were usually considered as simple individuals, not constituting one animated system, but rather a congeries of animated systems,\u2014a congeries, too, which after all is nothing more than a species of society, where animated beings are associated together for mutual protection; such as we see among men in a city; among bees in their cells, which, in point of form, are similar to plants.\n\n\u2020 Barclay on Muscular Motions, p. 265.\n\nAs all living beings are so related to each other, and Neceffity of to the inanimate objects of nature, as to be capable of deriving benefit, or receiving injuries, from the one or to organizing from the other; it seems necessary that they should possess the faculty of perceiving the proximity of the beneficial or injurious object, that they may avail themselves of the benefit which it holds out, or avoid the danger which it threatens. Accordingly, we find that all organized beings enjoy in some degree the capacity of receiving impressions, which we think is proved by the motions which take place in them when affected by external agents. When a plant expands its flowers to the sun, or turns as it were, its back to the blast; when it stretches out the fibres of its roots to imbibe the distant moisture, or directs its branches to the only clink by which it can receive the light of day; we think these motions are the consequence of that capacity of receiving impressions, or of being roused to action by stimuli; we think that this may be conceded, without having recourse to the influence of mind, or even the medium of a nervous system; we do not believe that the grass we crush beneath our feet is sensible of pain, nor do we suppose with the poet, that\n\n\"E'en the poor beetle that we tread on,\nIn mortal sufferance feels a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\"\n\nbut we are of opinion, that even in the lowest tribes Sensitivity, there is a degree of that faculty, which in the higher orders of animals we call Sensibility, and which we shall here, after a lecturer on the animal economy in London, denominate Sensitivity. This inferior degree of the sensitive faculty we shall suppose to be possessed by plants, zoophytes, and animalcul\u00e6, or those organized beings in which we can perceive no marks of a nervous system; while we shall confine the term Sensibility to all other classes of animals.\n\nThese faculties we consider as qualities of living Bodies, while we regard sensation, like perception, as a quality of mind. We leave it to the metaphysician to mark the line of distinction between sensibility and sensation, and to show how the one arises from the other. See Metaphysics, Part I. chap. 1.\n\nThe organs of sensation consist of the brain properly called, the cerebrum, the medulla oblongata, the system of spinal marrow, the nerves, and ganglia; together forming what is called the nervous system. These parts in the human body have been described under Anatomy. For an account of these organs in the inferior animals, we must refer to the lectures of Cuvier, vol. ii. or the Comparative Anatomy of Blumenbach.\n\nIn respect of Sensibility the animal is only passive; but when sensation is produced, he becomes active, in as much as the organs of the external senses are then brought into action. It is by means of these senses, that the animal receives intelligence from without. We shall therefore examine these before we mention the phenomena of sensation in general.\n\n1. Of Feeling.\n\nThe most general of all the senses, and the most wide-Feeling.\nly diffused over the body of an animal is that of touch or feeling. Animals that possess scarcely any other sense seem always to have that of touch. It is doubtedless by this that polyps, actinia, and other water animals, perceive the approach of their prey, or are warned of impending danger, from the agitation of the water that is communicated to their bodies. Indeed so general is this sense, that some physiologists think we may reduce all others to it as a genus; and suppose that smelling, tasting, hearing, and seeing, are only species of feeling. This reference is not uncommon in ordinary speech, as it is not unusual to talk of feeling a smell.\n\nBy touch, taken in its ordinary limited sense, we perceive the more striking external qualities of bodies, as figure, hardness, softness, roughness, smoothness, moistness, dryness, heat, cold; of all which, except figure, we could scarcely form any idea by the other senses. There is probably no sense that can so well supply the place of others as that of touch; and it is particularly acute in those who have lost their sight or hearing. See the article Blind, especially the Appendix.\n\nThe organs of touch are the skin and its productions, or rather the nervous papillae (see Anatomy, No. 76.) that form so large a part of the true skin. As many animals, however, have the body enveloped in a scaly, flabby, or hairy covering, as to prevent the actual contact of the body by external objects, there are other organs that seem destined to fulfil this office. In man, the points of the fingers and the lips are the most delicate feeling organs; in many quadrupeds too, the lips seem to possess an exquisite sensibility, and in some, as the rhinoceros, the upper lip is lengthened out as if to serve the purpose of a hand. The prolonged snouts of the tapir, the boar, the mole, and the hog, seem to answer the same purpose; and the exquisite sensibility and flexibility of the trunk of the elephant is well known to fit that organ for almost all the purposes to which the human hand can be applied. The tail, in some species of monkey, opossum and anteater, and in some reptiles, seems to possess a high degree of sensibility. In some animals, as the cat, the whiskers are employed as organs of feeling, as we know that these are erected when the animal is passing through a narrow hole. Several species of fishes have cirri and tentacula, which they seem to use as fingers in ascertaining the approach of their prey; and in insects, the antennae and the palpi are evidently organs of feeling, as are the arms, the tufts, and tentacula of sea-stars, sea-urchins, actinia, medusa, and many zoophytes.\n\nMost of the actions of external bodies on the surface of the animal body, are merely mechanical, though the sensations which they communicate may often be the effects of a chemical change in some of the feeling organs, and this change can be produced only in consequence of the power of simple pressure, to form or destroy some of the combinations that take place in the animal system. The sensations which appear most evidently to arise from a chemical change in the organs, are those that give notice of a change of temperature. When a body that has a temperature below that of the animal, comes in contact with the surface of this latter, we know that it abstracts from that surface a part of its caloric, as by the contact it gradually acquires the temperature of the animal; unless, indeed, it be so large and so cold as altogether to destroy life. As, however, the resistance which the animal body gives to a too great change of temperature, generally confines this change to the surface of the body; there must be something more than a mechanical or a chemical action, or the sense of feeling must depend chiefly on the vital principle.\n\nAs the sense of feeling, from its general diffusion, universally may be considered as the most essential of all the senses; its degrees of perfection have considerable influence on the nature of different animals.\n\nOf all vertebral animals, man seems to possess this sense in the most perfect degree; but among the invertebrate animals, the touch seems to improve as the other senses degenerate; and those animals which appear to have no other sense, possess this in so exquisite a degree that they seem to feel even the light.\n\nDr Darwin thinks it probable, that the animal body is furnished with a distinct set of nerves for the sensation of heat and cold. We do not see the necessity of this, as we think that this sensation is very naturally reducible to that of feeling.\n\nTo this head naturally belongs the consideration of what parts of the human body possess sensibility, and of the animals that are insensible. This discussion is curious, and was some time ago exercised the ingenuity of two very able physiologists, Haller and Whytt; between whom it gave rise to a long and warm dispute. We cannot pretend to enter into the merits of this controversy, for an account of which we refer our readers to Dr Whytt's Physiological Essays, and to the Principes de Physiologie of Dumas, tom. ii. part. iii. sect. i. chap. i.\n\nThe general result seems to be, that many parts will appear sensible or insensible, according to the nature of the stimuli applied to them, and that many of those parts which in their natural and healthy state appear insensible, are when inflamed or otherwise altered by diseases, highly sensible; and that the brain, which is considered as the centre of all sensation, and the puncture or laceration of which is attended with most distressing symptoms in other parts, is to ordinary stimuli as insensible as the cuticle or the nails. See also on this subject, Bichat \"Anatomie Generale,\" tom. i. p. 161.\n\nThe principal morbid affections of this sense, are pain, itching, and want of feeling; for an account of which see Medicine, No. 77. The functions of the skin, independently of its use as an organ of touch, will be considered in two of our succeeding chapters.\n\n2. Of Tasting.\n\nThis sense is the most nearly allied to feeling of any of the other senses, and therefore very properly comes under our consideration after that sense.\n\nThe principal organ of taste is the tongue, especially at its upper surface, point, and edges; but it also extends to the lips, the palate, and the velum pendulum palati. The tongue is not absolutely necessary to taste, as appears from a case mentioned by Jussieu, of a person who had only a fleshy tubercle in place of a tongue, and yet possessed the sense sufficiently perfect.\n\nThe several parts of the organs of taste are not equally sensitive to every fluid body; the tongue seems to be more particularly affected by saline and saccharine substances, only affected chiefly, however, at its upper surface; the lips are said to be...\nbe most susceptible of the taste of hellebore, the palate of belladonna, and the gullet of wormwood. The moronidia elaterium is said chiefly to affect the back of the tongue, and colocynth its middle.\n\nThe greater or less perfection of this sense depends much on the softness, flexibility, and moistness of these parts. As man seems to possess these qualifications in a more eminent degree than most other animals, so, in the natural unsophisticated state of the tongue, he probably enjoys the benefit of taste much more highly than they. Such is the case with all young children, and with the peasant, whose simple fare appears to be eaten with a much greater relish than all the delicacies of the voluptuary, who must have recourse to various stimuli to enable him to derive gratification from even the daintiest viands (A).\n\nTaste seems to be more exquisite when the rapid body is strongly pressed between the tongue and the palate. Taste is also rendered more acute when the tongue is stimulated by various condiments, as pepper, mustard, which even, when not taken in such quantity as to be very perceptible themselves, evidently increase the relish of the dishes which they season. Much also depends on the nature and state of the bodies that are applied to the organs of taste. These must, in the first place, be either fluid, or capable of solution in the saliva. They must also possess some saline or acid quality, to render them capable of acting on the nervous papillae. It was formerly supposed, that saline bodies alone possessed the power of affecting the organs of taste; and it was conceived by Bellini, that the different flavours of saline bodies depended on the figure of their crystalline particles. M. Dumas has taken considerable pains, and has advanced several arguments, to show the absurdity of this hypothesis; and we think has treated it with more seriousness than it deserves. That the different sensations which rapid bodies excite in our organs of taste, depend chiefly on a difference in their chemical nature, must, we think, be allowed, and some have gone so far as to suppose, that the sensation depends on some chemical affinity between the rapid body and the nervous fluid.\n\nThe impression which rapid bodies make on the organs of taste is modified by age, sex, temperament, and habit. We know that children are particularly pleased with sweet things, while high seasoned dishes and vinous liquors are more palatable to people of a more advanced age. Women, from various causes, especially during pregnancy, and when labouring under hysterical affections, have often very singular tastes. People of a warm and mobile constitution are often affected by flavours that are almost insensible to others; and custom will render palatable many substances, which, when first tasted, are rejected with disgust.\n\nBesides the gratification afforded to animals by the sense of taste, this is supposed to afford one of the principal means of distinguishing between wholesome and deleterious substances. Indeed, with respect to the inferior animals, this discriminating sense is seldom known to fail, and in this instance, they are superior to man, who is often deceived. There are many poisonous herbs, the fruits or roots of which have a taste not unpleasant, but which cannot be eaten with impunity.\n\nOn the morbid affections of taste, see Medicine, No. 78.\n\n3. Of Smelling.\n\nThe sense of smelling, like that of taste, is nearly allied to feeling, and is one of those by which we become acquainted with the mechanical and chemical properties of external bodies. It is caused by volatile particles flying off from odorous bodies, and diffused or dissolved in the atmosphere, in union with which they enter the nostrils and affect the nerves of the smelling organs.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain what are the essential organs of smelling. We know that in most animals which breathe through lungs or gills, there is either a nose, or there are certain holes that serve the purpose of nostrils; but in many animals there is nothing similar to these, and yet there is every reason to believe that they possess the sense of smelling in an exquisite degree.\n\nInsects discover their food at a distance. Butterflies seek their females, even when inclosed in boxes; and as they are liable to be deceived by resemblance of colour, it is evident that these insects are guided in many circumstances by the sense of smell. Thus the flesh-fly (muco vomitoria) lays its eggs on plants that have a fetid smell, imagining that it places them on corrupted flesh, and the larvae which are thus produced perish for want of their necessary food.\n\nAs the organ of smell, in all animals which respire air, is situated at the entrance of the organs of respiration, the most probable conjecture that has been proposed respecting its seat in insects, is that of Balthus, since revived by several naturalists, who placed it in the mouths of the tracheae or air tubes. Besides many other reasons that might be stated in support of this opinion, we may observe, that the internal membrane of the tracheae appears very well calculated to perform this office, being soft and moistened, and that the insects in which the tracheae enlarge, and form numerous or considerable vesicles, are those which seem to possess the most perfect sense of smelling. Such are all the scarabaei, the bees, flies, &c.\n\nThe antennae, which other anatomists have supposed to be the seat of smelling in insects, do not appear to Cuvier to possess any of the requisites for that organ.\n\nThe mollusca, which respire air, may also possess this sensation at the entrance of their pulmonary vessels; but it is not necessary to search for a particular organ of this sense in them, as their whole skin appears to resemble a pituitary membrane. It is everywhere soft, fungous, and is always moistened by a great quantity of mucous matter. Finally, it is supplied with numerous nerves, which animate every point of its surface.\n\n(A) It is generally supposed, that the sense of tasting is more acute in some of the inferior animals than in man; an opinion which is founded chiefly on the greater size and number of the papillae of the tongue in those animals. It is scarcely possible to decide this point; but we should conceive, from the infinite variety of substances that are occasionally subjected to the human palate, and from the extreme delicacy of taste displayed by some individuals, that man has the advantage of his brute neighbours in this sense.\nThe worms and soft zoophytes, and all the polytes, are probably in the same situation. It cannot be doubted but that these animals enjoy the sense of smell. It is chiefly by it that they discover their food, particularly the species that have no eyes. Aristotle remarked, that certain herbs, which have a strong odour, were avoided by cuttle-fishes and the octopus.\n\nOf all the substances which affect our organs of sensation, odours are the least understood, though the impressions which they make on the animal body appear to be most powerful and extensive. Some bodies are always odorous, because the whole or a part of their substance, being volatile, it is constantly lying off; others become odorous, only under certain circumstances; as when a body containing a volatile principle in its composition is decomposed by another that has a less affinity for that principle, e.g., when muriate of ammonia is decomposed by quicklime.\n\nOdours seem to be propagated in the air, much in the same manner as one fluid is diffused through another. Their motion is not direct, like that of light, nor is it rapid or susceptible of reflection and refraction like light and caloric. The odorous particles of volatile bodies may enter into combination with different substances, by chemical affinity, and thus lose their original properties. In this way the effluvia of putrid meat are destroyed by fresh burnt charcoal, and the noxious exhalations from pestilential apartments are removed by the vapours of nitric or muriatic acid.\n\nThese circumstances seem to prove that each smell is occasioned by a particular substance floating in the atmosphere. There are others, however, which appear to indicate that odour is not always produced in this manner.\n\nSeveral bodies yield a strong smell for a great length of time, without sustaining any sensible loss of substance; such, for example, is milk. Some odours are perceived when no evaporation can be observed, as the smell which arises from the friction of copper, that produced by the fusion of a great number of bodies, and even by the melting of common ice. In other cases, real evaporations produce no sensible odour; this may be remarked on the disengagement of several gases, and even on the ordinary evaporation of water. Perhaps these phenomena prove only that the force of sensation is not proportional to the quantity of the substance by which it is excited, but that it depends on the nature and degree of the affinity of that substance with the nervous fluid.* The action of the greater part of odorous substances on the nervous system, is rendered manifest by a number of other effects besides the sensation of smell; some produce faintings, others giddiness, or even convulsions. Some, on the contrary, serve to remove these disorders: indeed the greater part of medicines act in general rather by their volatile and odorous parts, than by their other principles; and afford new proofs of the influence exercised in the animal economy by the gaseous and impalpable substances, the greater part of which are doubtless still unknown to us.\n\nWe know not whether odours have a peculiar vehicle, besides the matter of heat, which is common to them all in their quality of vapours or elastic fluids. We cannot explain why odours are agreeable or disagreeable to us, nor why those that are disagreeing to us appear pleasing to other animals, and vice versa. Though man and other animals are generally pleased with the odour of those substances which serve them as food; yet when their appetite is satisfied, this odour often becomes displeasing to them. On the contrary, some animals appear to have a passionate fondness for strong smelling substances which seem altogether useless to them. Thus cats are extremely fond of cat-mint, and the fresh roots of valerian. In general, those odours which are most disagreeable indicate that the substances from which they proceed are injurious. Thus venomous plants, putrid flesh, and poisonous minerals, have commonly an unpleasant odour. This rule, however, is not universal; and the sense of smell, like that of taste, is not an unerring guide to man, whatever it may be to other animals.\n\nIt appears that the effluvia of odorous bodies are capable of diffusing themselves through water as well as air; for when these substances are thrown into water as bait for fish, we find that these animals are attracted by the smell from a considerable distance.\n\nThe comparative physiology of this sense is very curious. Comparisons, though we cannot explain the reason of the differences that we find to take place in the various tribes of animals. Man in a state of civilized society, where he may have recourse to a great variety of means by which to distinguish the properties of bodies, has less occasion for acuteness of smell; but we know that savages are in that respect greatly his superiors. Their smell is so acute, that like a blood-hound, they can scent their enemy to a great distance, and pursue his track with almost certain success. Among birds and beasts of prey we also find that acuteness of smell is a very general property. Hyenas, wolves, vultures, and ravens, can distinguish the putrid carcases on which they feed many miles off; and it is asserted by naturalists, that jackalls hunt in packs, and follow their game like hounds by the scent. There is a curious diversity in this respect among birds, some having this sense very acute, others very blunt. We are told by Gattoni*, that the cock is scarcely affected with the smell of ammonia or hartshorn, while the duck is said to avoid all powerful odours whether agreeable or otherwise. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the nature of the olfactory membrane, nor with that of the nerves distributed to it, to enable us to form an opinion respecting the degree and the kind of sensations they procure to different animals. It may, however, be at first sight presumed, that all things in other respects being equal, the animals in which the olfactory membrane is most extensive, enjoy the sensation of smell most exquisitely; and experience confirms this conjecture. It would be curious to learn why the animals which possess the sense of smell in the highest degree, are precisely those which feed on the most fetid substances, as we observe in dogs which eat carrion.\n\n4. Of Hearing.\n\nThe sense of hearing is more important than any sense which we have yet noticed, but it appears to be less generally diffused.\n\nBy means of it we become acquainted with those properties of bodies which fit them for making sensible impressions on the air, as hardness, elasticity, &c.; and these impressions on the air, when communicated to the organs of hearing, convey to our mind the ideas of sound.\nBy this sense we derive two of the highest gratifications that we are capable of enjoying, viz. the pleasures of conversation and of music; and in this way most animals hold intercourse with each other.\n\nThe organs of hearing differ exceedingly in the various classes of animals. The human ear and its appendages have been described in Anatomy, Part I., chap. vi., sect. 4.; and for an account of these organs in other animals, we must refer to Cuvier's Lectures, vol. ii., or the Comparative Anatomy of Blumenbach, chap. xx. Red-blooded animals without exception have evident auditory organs; and analogous parts are found in many of the white-blooded. In a great number of the inferior classes, however, no such parts have been ascertained, though it is certain that many of them do really hear. In all those in which these organs have been detected, there is always found a gelatinous pulp, covered with a fine, elastic membrane, and in this pulp the ramifications of the auditory nerve are lost. It is therefore highly probable that the seat of hearing resides in the minute nervous fibres that are distributed through the pulp, and that this latter is the medium by which sounds are communicated from the percussed air. We may form a tolerably just idea of the manner in which this pulpy substance is connected with the external movements that are the cause of sound; for this quivering jelly will readily receive the concussions of the air or water that are transmitted to it from the vibrations of sonorous bodies, and communicate them to the nervous filaments. Thus far only can we trace the motion of sound; but the steps by which this motion is carried on till the perception of sound is produced in the mind, are equally unknown to the anatomist and the metaphysician.\n\nThe philosophy of sound has already been treated of under Acoustics. It is necessary here to remark only, that the qualities of sound may be distinguished into force, depending on the extent of the vibrations of the body from which the sound proceeds; tone, depending on the velocity of the vibrations; resonance, arising from the intimate composition of the sonorous body; simple modulation of voice, and articulations.\n\nThe human ear can distinguish all these different qualities with relation to one sound; this distinction is made with wonderful accuracy, by persons who frequently exercise that faculty, and particularly by professional musicians. The other mammalia exhibit proofs that they are capable of distinguishing the qualities of sound which relate to speech, that is to say, simple vocal modulations and articulations; for we may observe daily, that they remember the sound and signification of several words. Some are strongly affected by certain sounds. Acute tones produce a painful sensation in dogs, and we also observe that these animals are terrified by violent noises; they therefore distinguish these two properties. Birds have a feeling, no less exquisite, of voice, tone, articulation, and even resonance, since they learn to sing with great correctness; and when their vocal organs permit them, can completely counterfeit the human speech, with all the modifications practised by the individuals they imitate.\n\nAs to cold-blooded animals, it is well known that several of them call each other by certain sounds, and that others, which are incapable of producing sounds, can at least understand them, as carp, which appear when the noise of a bell indicates to them that they are to be fed, &c.; but we know not what qualities of sound they distinguish, and how far, in this respect, the delicacy of their sense of hearing extends.\n\nFor the morbid affections of hearing, see Medicine, No. 82.\n\n5. Of Seeing.\n\nAs we ascend from the simpler to the more complex seeing-faculties, we find a greater scope for description and observation; but we also find our physiological difficulties increased. The sense of touch being the most simple of all the senses, requires but a simple organization, and is the most widely diffused; that of vision, on the other hand, is the most complex, and requires for its mechanism, a more elaborate set of organs. There is not, in the whole animal structure, a more curious and admirable organ than the eye, whether we contemplate it in its most perfect state in the human body, or in its most simple conformation, as it appears in the horn of a snail.\n\nThe anatomy of the human eye has been sufficiently described in the article Anatomy, Part I., chap. vi., sect. 5.; and if our readers desire a fuller account of this organ, we may refer them to the elegant work of Professor Soemmerring. The structure of the eye in the inferior animals is well described in Cuvier's twelfth lecture, and in Blumenbach's Comparative Anatomy, chap. xvi. We shall extract from the former a description of the eyes of insects and crustaceous animals, as being among the most curious and least known subjects of comparative anatomy.\n\n\"The structure of the eye of insects is so very different from that of other animals, even the mollusca, that it would be difficult to believe it an organ of sight, had not experiments, purposely made, demonstrated its use. If we cut out, or cover with opaque matter, the eye of the dragon-fly, it will strike against walls in its flight. If we cover the compound eyes of the wasp, it ascends perpendicularly in the air, until it completely disappears; if we cover its simple eyes only, it will not attempt to fly, but will remain perfectly immovable.\n\n\"The surface of a compound eye, when viewed by the microscope, exhibits an innumerable multitude of hexagonal facets, slightly convex, and separated from one another by small furrows, which frequently contain fine hairs, more or less long.\n\n\"These facets form altogether a hard and elastic membrane, which, when freed of the substances that adhere to it posteriorly, is very transparent.\n\n\"Each of these small surfaces may be considered either as a cornea, or a crystalline; for it is convex externally, and concave internally, but thicker in the middle than at the edges, it is also the only transparent part in this singular eye.\n\n\"Immediately behind this transparent membrane there is an opaque substance, which varies greatly as to colour in different species, and which sometimes forms, even in the same eye, spots or bands of different colours. Its consistence is the same as that of the pigment of the choroides; it entirely covers the posterior part of the transparent facets, without leaving any aperture for the passage of the light.\n\n\"Behind this pigment we find some very short white filaments, in the form of hexagonal prisms, situated close to each other, like the stones of a pavement, and precisely...\nprecisely equal in number to the facets of the cornea; each penetrates into the hollow part of one of these facets, and is separated from it only by the pigment mentioned above. If these filaments are nervous, as in my opinion they appear to be, we may consider each as the retina of the surface behind which it is placed; but it will always remain to be explained, how the light can act on this retina, through a coat of opaque pigment.\n\n\"This multitude of filaments, perpendicular to the cornea, have behind them a membrane which serves them all as a base, and which is consequently nearly parallel to the cornea; this membrane is very fine, and of a blackish colour, which is not caused by a pigment, but extends to its most intimate texture; we observe in it very fine whitish lines, which are tracheae, and will produce still finer branches, that penetrate between the hexagonal filaments, as far as the cornea. By analogy, we may name this membrane the choroides.\n\n\"A thin expansion of the optic nerve is applied to the posterior part of the choroides. This is a real nervous membrane, perfectly similar to the retina of red-blooded animals; it appears that the white filaments, which form the particular retinae of the different ocular surfaces, are productions of this general retina, which perforates the membrane I have named choroides, by a multitude of small and almost imperceptible holes.\n\n\"To obtain a distinct view of all these parts, it is necessary to cut off the head of an insect that has the eyes large, and dissect it posteriorly; each part will then be removed in an order the reverse of that in which I have described them.\n\n\"In the cray fishes, in general, the eye is situated on a moveable tubercle. The extremity, which is rounded on every side, and sometimes elongated into a cone, when viewed by a glass, presents the same surfaces as the eyes of insects. When we cut this tubercle longitudinally, we observe that the optic nerve passes through it in a cylindrical canal, which occupies the place of its axis. Arrived at the centre of the concavity of the eye, it forms a small button, which detaches very fine filaments in every direction; at a certain distance these filaments meet the choroides, which is nearly concentrical with the cornea, and covers the spherical brush of the extremity of the nerve, like a hood. All the distance between the choroides and the cornea is occupied, as in insects, by white filaments, closely arranged in a perpendicular direction to each other, and which have the extremity next the cornea also coated with a black pigment.\n\n\"These filaments perforate the choroides, and are continuations of those produced by the button, which terminates the optic nerve.\"\n\nThe immediate seat of vision is still in dispute; but it appears to be the expansion of the optic nerve upon the inner coat of the eye. The other parts of that organ serve to collect, refract, absorb, and sometimes even reflect, the rays of light, according as these operations are required for the distinct vision of any particular animal. Those animals that seek for their prey during night, have a pupil that is very dilatable, and have very little of that dark substance called pigmentum nigrum, that lies between the retina and the choroid coat in diurnal animals. Thus, the former have their eyes better adapted to receive and to retain the feeble rays of light, and thus possess a great advantage over the animals which they pursue, whose eyes are calculated for seeing best in a strong light.\n\nThe subject of vision has been so fully considered under Optics, Part I., sect. 5, that it is unnecessary for us to give any detailed account of it here. We shall therefore merely enumerate the principal phenomena.\n\n1. The rays of light proceeding from luminous bodies, are collected by the cornea; variously refracted by the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous humours, till they meet in a point (in perfect vision) in the retina, from which the sensation conveyed to the brain, excites there the ideas of light, colour, and other qualities of extreme objects, of which the eye is capable of judging.\n\n2. The image of the object thus pictured on the retina, is inverted, though the mind is habituated to perceive it as if it were erect.\n\n3. There is a certain point within the eye where the retina is deficient, and here the luminous rays make no impression.\n\n4. The eye is calculated to see objects most distinctly at certain distances or foci, though these distances vary considerably in different species, and different individuals. A person of ordinary sight can read a middle-sized print most distinctly at the distance of about eight inches. Those who require less distance are near-sighted, or myopes, and in them the point of divergence of rays is before the retina. Those who require a greater distance are long-sighted, or presbyopes; and in these the point of divergence is behind the retina.\n\n5. In those animals that have two eyes, an image of a luminous object is formed in each, though the mind is accustomed to unite both images into one. In strabismus or squinting, the two eyes not being similarly directed, do not concur in producing a single object.\n\n6. Though the images of many objects are impressed on the retina at the same time, the mind can attend distinctly to only one of them.\n\n7. In perfect vision, the pupil contracts or dilates according to the greater or lesser quantity of light that is present.\n\n8. When the eye has looked steadily for some time on a circumscribed space, of a particular colour, as a piece of red paper placed on a white ground, it perceives a border of a different colour surrounding the original spot. This surrounding colour is called the accidental colour of the former, and differs according to the colour of the original spot. In the present instance it is green, or bluish-green. The other natural colours are attended by the following accidental colours, viz. orange, by blue, with nearly an equal proportion of indigo; yellow by indigo, with a mixture of violet; green by violet, with a mixture of red; blue by red, with a mixture of orange; indigo by yellow, with a considerable mixture of orange; and violet by green, with a considerable mixture of blue (B).\n\n(B) Dr Darwin, in his Zoonomia, vol. i., sect. 2, employs the phenomena of accidental colours to prove that the fibres...\nThe exercise of distinct vision depends chiefly on the following circumstances: 1. The perfect transparency of the cornea, and the several humours of the eye; 2. on the just proportional distance between the cornea and the crystalline lens, and on their degree of convexity; 3. on the sensibility of the retina; 4. on the degree of illumination of the visible object; 5. on the colour of the pigmentum between the choroid and the retina; and 6. on the contraction and dilatation of the pupil.\n\nThe action of light on living beings is not confined to its effects in producing vision. It seems to act on the system in general as a moderate but constant stimulus. When the light of day is vivid, as in bright sunshine, the body is more active, and the mind more vigorous, than under a cloudy sky. Those climates which are frequently obscured by clouds and vapours, are notoriously the birthplaces of seriousness and gloom; and Boeotian dulness and English melancholy have long become proverbial; while on the contrary, the serene brightness of an eastern sky has been considered as peculiarly favourable to the exertions of imagination, and the flights of fancy. Mr Stuart, a famous pedellian traveller, told Dr Rush, that during a summer which he passed in a high northern latitude, where the sun is visible for several months together, he enjoyed an uncommon share of health and spirits, which he attributed to the long continuance of the light of the sun. In a state of nature most animals retire to rest when the light fails, and few people can sleep soundly, unless light be excluded.\n\nThe stimulating effects of light are peculiarly evident on persons whose nervous system is unusually sensible; they cannot bear strong light, which not only hurts their eyes, but produces considerable agitation on their whole frame. The same effects are produced on those who have been confined in a dark prison. The countenance of these unfortunate pale and fallow. This latter effect of the absence of light is similar to what takes place in vegetables, as we know that the colour, taste, and smell of plants depend on their being exposed to a due degree of light.\n\nIt has been remarked, that those animals which have been long confined in a dark situation, are universally disposed to grow fat; and this has been found to take place even in condemned criminals, in whom we would least expect it. This obesity has been attributed chiefly to the absence of light. We are disposed to think that the absence of this stimulus can have no immediate effect, but that the disposition to obesity depends rather on the indolence of the confined animals, which is favoured by the absence of light.\n\nFor an account of the principal morbid affections of vision, see Medicine, No 81.\n\n6. Is there in some animals a sixth sense?\n\nFrom the experiments of Jurin and Spallanzani on the flight of bats that have been deprived of sight, (see Mammalia, No 38.) it has been supposed by some that the accuracy with which these animals in their flight avoided the obstacles that were placed in their way, is owing to some additional senses which they possess. Others have conceived that the sense of hearing which appears to be very acute in the species on which these experiments were made, is sufficient to supply their want of sight. It is scarcely possible to ascertain which of these two opinions is the more probable; but the writer of this article is rather inclined to adopt the latter, from having observed that when he was walking in an unfrequented street, when it was very dark, he was enabled to avoid running against the common flares that projected into the street, from a certain sensation that he perceived, when he approached the wall of the stair, which he cannot better describe than by saying that the air at these points appeared to be unusually still.\n\nWith respect to sensation in general, we may lay down the following laws, which are considered by Dumas as fundamental principles of this function.\n\n1. As activity is an essential character of sensation, this cannot exist without a certain action of the organs, sensation, and must be proportioned to the degree of attention bestowed on the external objects, or ideas by which it is produced.\n\n2. A repetition of the same sensations tends to render the sensibility less acute, and less capable of receiving new impressions. By repose its energy is restored.\n\n3. As sensibility cannot be employed on two impressions at the same time, it must hold a certain balance throughout all the organs, and it cannot be acutely excited in one part, without being proportionably diminished in another.\n\n4. Sensibility is a relative faculty, which is not equally obedient to all kinds of excitations, but only to those which have some relation to it in the different parts of the living body.\n\n5. It is increased and accumulated in the direct proportion to the defect or weakness of stimulus.\n\n6. It is not proportioned to the number, arrangement, or distribution of the nerves, and its changes of increase or diminution are not susceptible of calculation.\n\n7. It is inconstant, variable in its progress, and unconfinable *.\n\nTo these we may add the following facts respecting this function and its organs.\n\n1. The nerves which are principally distributed to the organs of the external senses, arise from that part of the senforium that is within the head.\n\n2. The sensations produced in any part by the contact of external bodies, are more perfect, according as the nerves which terminate in that part arise more immediately from the common senforium.\n\n3. When a ligature is tightened on a nerve, the parts on which the nerve is distributed are deprived of sensation as far as depends on that nerve.\n\n4. Compression of the brain diminishes general sensation in proportion to its intensity. Slight compression produces numbness.\n\n5. Though sensation probably takes place only in the central parts of the senforium, it is commonly referred to the extremities of the nerves. Thus, a gouty person who has lost his leg, will suppose that he sometimes feels\n\nfibres of the retina are thrown into contraction, like those of muscles, and that some of them act as antagonists to others; as he considers the accidental as the reverse of the natural colours.","sp":64,"ep":79},{"h":"THE BODIES OF WHICH IT CONSISTS ARE EVIDENTLY CONNECTED BY","t":"e bodies of which it consists are evidently connected by means of those properties by which we observe that they produce changes in each other's situation. This assemblage of objects may therefore be justly called a system. We may call it the material system. It is frequently termed nature; and of the terms natural appearances, natural causes, natural laws, have been generally restricted to those which take place in the material system. This definition of friction, however, is improper, because there is no difference in the manner in which we form our notions of those laws, and reason from them, both with respect to mind and body. Or if there is to be any restriction, and if any part of the study of the universe is to be excluded in the application of these terms, it is that part only which considers moral obligation, and rather treats of what ought to be than of what is. As has been already observed, there is a considerable difference in the language which must be employed; but still there is none in the principles of investigation. We have no proof for the extent of any moral law but an appeal to the feelings of the hearts of men, indicated by the general laws or facts which are observed in their actions.\n\nBut this is only a question of the propriety of language. And no great inconvenience would arise from the restriction now mentioned if it were scrupulously adhered to; but unfortunately this is not always the case. Some authors use the term natural law to express every coincidence of fact; and this is certainly used, and the proper use of the term. The French writers generally use the term loi physique in this enlarged sense. But many authors, misled by, or taking advantage of, the ambiguity of language, after having established a law founded on a copious and perhaps unexpected induction of the phenomena of the material system (in which case it must be considered in its restricted sense), have, in their explanation of phenomena, extended their principle much farther than the induction on which they had founded the existence of the physical law. They have extended it to the phenomena of mind, and have led their followers into great and dangerous mistakes. Languages, like every other production of human skill, are imperfect. They are deficient in terms, and are therefore figurative. The most obvious, the most frequent, and the most interesting uses of language, have always produced the appropriated terms, and the progress of cultivation has never completely supplied new ones. There are certain analogies or resemblances, or certain associations of ideas, so plain, that a term appropriated to one very familiar object will serve to suggest another analogous to it, when aided by the concomitant circumstances of the discourse; and this with sufficient precision for the ordinary purposes of social communication, and without leading us into any considerable mistakes; and it is only the rare and refined disquisitions of the curious speculatist that bring the poverty and imperfection of language into view, and make us wish for words as numerous as our thoughts. There is hardly a sentence, even of common discourse, in which there are not several figures either of single words or of phrases; and when very accurate discrimination is required, it is almost impossible to find words or phrases to express distinctions which we clearly feel. We believe it impossible to express, by the scanty vocabulary\nWe have examples of the second class in the phenomena of heat and mixture, and those exhibited in the growth of animals and vegetables, and many phenomena of fluid, fluid, magnetic, electrical, and luminous bodies, in which no change of place can be observed.\n\nThus it appears that there is a distinction in the phenomena sufficiently great to warrant a division of the study, and to make us expect a more rapid improvement by this division. Nay, the division has been made by nature itself, in the acquaintance which men have attained with her operations without study, before science appeared, and while art constituted all our knowledge.","sp":28,"ep":29},{"h":"THE CETACEA EMPLOY MUCH THE SAME","t":"e cetacea employ much the same means as fishes; but in them the principal efforts of the tail are made in a vertical direction, and the use of the air-bag is supplied by lungs, which they can compress and dilate at pleasure, by the action of the diaphragm, or the intercostal muscles. See CETOLOGY.\n\nThe swimming of mammalia, and of water birds, is performed by means of the legs and feet, which are used like oars, to propel the body forward by the resistance which they make to the water in the contrary direction. Hence those quadrupeds and birds that have flat or webbed feet, swim most easily, as the resisting surface is the greatest. Of all the mammalia, man has the most occasion to use his hands in swimming, on account of the greater proportional weight of his head.\n\nSerpents, and the larvae of such insects as sometimes inhabit the waters, perform the action of swimming by rapid inflections of the body like an eel or a leech. The larvae that are most commonly found in the waters are those of the water beetle, the hydropilus, the day fly, the aquatic tipule, and gnat.\n\nNo animal walks without legs, or flies without wings (if we except the flying fish, whose fins enable it rather to swim than to fly); but there are many that swim without fins, and that leap and creep without any legs. The rapidity of movement is not proportioned to the number of instruments that are employed: if the spout-fish be observed to move slowly with one leg, the sea-urchin moves still more slowly with many thousands; the oyster moves by squirting out water; the scallop by the jerk of its shell, and when in the water it rises to the surface and sails before the wind.\n\nMany animals are formed by nature to fly, walk, leap, and swing; the fate of those is rather uncommon whose muscles or feet are by nature attached to their integuments; the lobster is obliged to throw off its shell, and the caterpillar all its feet, with the skins, and in that situation to remain stationary till it receive new instruments of motion.\n\nWhoever has read the celebrated work De Motu Animalium, needs not to be told that, besides the organs which are here mentioned, the form, the structure, and even the specific gravity of the body, as depending on the nature of the bones and muscles, or as varied by air-vehicles and bubbles, with a great variety of other circumstances, are necessary to explain the different phenomena of locomotion.\n\nAs to vegetable motions, they evidently depend on external agents: the wings of seeds only fit them to be carried by the wind, their specific gravity to float in the water, and their legs or tentacula to adhere to bodies that are in motion; the singular motions which have been ascribed to sleeping, to waking, to sensation, and of Animal Motion, in the vegetable kingdom, seem only the consequence of light, heat, moisture, and such stimulants, acting invisibly or with secret influence: the opening and closing of the meteoric flowers are always correspondent to the states of the atmosphere; and the opening and closing of the equinoctial and tropic flowers, to the length or shortness of the day.\n\nThe principal intentions of locomotion are to get food, to shun danger, to promote intercourse and propagate the species.\n\nThere is perhaps no part of physiology which is more important than the relations which subsist between the different functions of the living body; but it is a part of the subject which is as yet but little understood. We regret that our limits will not permit us to pay all the attention to it which we could wish. We shall, however, briefly notice under each function, the principal relations that are found to take place between it and those which have been previously considered.\n\nBesides the dependence which animal motion has, in most instances, on the nervous system, (see No. i.) we find an evident sympathy between these two functions in a variety of phenomena. A violent emotion or impression on the nerves often throws the limbs into convulsive agitations; spasmodic affections are relieved, or sometimes removed, by the coming on of delirium; and these symptoms will alternate with each other: a compression of the brain, or of some large nervous trunk, produces general or partial want of motion, and when this compression is removed, the muscles for the most part recover their usual action; an attack of epilepsy is often preceded by the sensation of a stream of vapour commencing in some external part, and rising to the brain. These, and many other phenomena that might be mentioned, fully prove the sympathy between the nervous and muscular systems; and with this enumeration we must dismiss the subject.\n\nCHAP. V. Of Digestion.\n\nThe necessity of repairing the waste of the body is announced in all animals by the feelings of hunger and thirst; the former of which intimates the occasion for solid, the latter for liquid food. This imperious necessity overrules all the other affections of the vital principle, and every other appetite often remains suspended till that necessity be satisfied. It is difficult to align the final cause of these singular sensations, but probably our researches on that subject are rather curious than useful. Whatever be the ultimate end of these appetites, we readily perceive how much they are influenced by habit. We find that when we are accustomed to take food at particular times, the appetite, under ordinary circumstances, always reminds us at these times, of the occasion, whether real or apparent, for receiving a new supply. By this influence of habit some animals, especially man, are accustomed to take several meals in a day, while others can fast for days, or even weeks, together. The appetite for food also varies considerably at different ages. It is more lively and more imperious in infancy and early childhood, and in general in those animals who have not yet acquired their full growth; it is on the contrary weaker in advanced age, and when the body ceases to increase.\nincrease in size. It is more frequently renewed in the strong and healthy, and those who are accustomed to laborious occupations or active exercises.\n\nWe know that in the natural state of the animal body, the appetite for food is influenced by the nature of the aliment on which the animal is accustomed to subsist. Many animals live entirely on vegetable food, and these have no appetite for animal substances, and even reject them when offered to them. On the other hand, many tribes live entirely on animal food, and either refuse vegetable, or, if obliged by necessity to employ it as food, do not appear to derive nourishment from it. We find, however, that it is in the power of habit to remove these appetites; that a horse or a sheep may be taught to live on animal food, while a dog or a cat may be supported entirely on vegetable substances. A few animals are capable of subsisting on almost every kind of animal or vegetable substances, or are omnivorous.\n\nMany animals are capable of being supported by water and air alone. We know that several fishes, as the minnow, the gold and silver fish, &c., will live for a long time in a vessel containing pure water, and freely exposed to the air. Rondelot (a celebrated writer on fishes in the 16th century) relates a remarkable instance of this. He kept a fish during three years in a vessel that was constantly full of very pure water. It grew to such a size, that at the end of that time the vessel could no longer contain it. Leeches are often kept for several years with no other nutriment but water, and that not very often changed. There is good reason to believe that the sole food of plants consists of water and air, and that the soil in which they grow answers scarcely any other purpose than that of preserving and conducting those necessary aliments.\n\nIt has been supposed that some animals are capable of subsisting on matters that appear to contain no nutritious principles, such as sand, hair, and wool. Borelli long ago conceived this opinion, from observing that in many terrestrial animals which he dissected, the alimentary tube contained nothing but sand. It has often been remarked, that horses, cows, and sheep, when deprived of their usual nourishment, will lick their bodies, and swallow down the hair, or, in the case of sheep, will tear off and swallow each other's wool. If we consider the nature of these substances, we think there is no reason to suppose that they answer any other purpose than defending the alimentary canal or stomach, and thus in some measure counteracting the effect of hunger.\n\nThe subject of food in general has been already treated of, under Aliment, and in Materia Medica, Part I. No. 173; and the function of digestion, as far as it relates to man, has been considered under Anatomy, No. 106, 107, and under Chemistry, No. 2548. It remains for us here only to make a few observations on the comparative physiology of this function.\n\nDigestion differs considerably in the various classes of animals, both as to the organs by which it is performed, and as to the simplicity or complex nature of the operation itself. The general variations that take place in the organs of digestion, have been mentioned under the comparative part of Anatomy, No. 152, and are fully treated of by Cuvier, in his Le\u00e7ons d'Anatomie Compar\u00e9e, tome iii, and Blumenbach, in his Comparative Anatomy, chap. 6. and 7.\n\nIn the more perfect animals, digestion supposes a series of operations, from the time that the food enters the mouth, till the nutritious parts of it are taken into the circulating system. These operations are, mastication, infalivation, deglutition, chymification, and chylification.","sp":91,"ep":92},{"h":"THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BARREL AND RECEIVER IS MADE BY","t":"e communication between the barrel and receiver is made by means of the pipe ABPQ; and there goes from the hole K in the top of the barrel a pipe KRST, which either communicates with the open air or with the receiver, by means of the cock at its extremity T. The conduit pipe ABPQ has also a cock at Q, by which it is made to communicate either with the receiver or with the open air. These channels of communication are variously conducted and terminated, according to the views of the maker: the sketch in this figure is sufficient for explaining the principle, and is suited to the general form of the pump, as it has been frequently made by Nairne and other artists in London.\n\nLet us now suppose the piston at the top of the barrel, and that it applies to it all over, and that the air in the barrel is very much rarefied: in the common pump the piston valve is pressed hard down by the atmosphere, and continues thus till the piston gets far down, condenses the air below it beyond its natural state, and enables it to force up the valves. But here, as soon as the piston quits the top of the barrel, it leaves a void behind it; for no air gets in round the piston rod, and the valve at K is shut by the pressure of the atmosphere. There is nothing now to oppose the elasticity of the air below but the stiffness of the valve \\( b c \\); and thus the expelling (or more accurately the liberating) force is prodigiously increased.\n\nThe superiority of this construction will be best seen shown by an example. Suppose the stiffness of the valve equal to the weight of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch of mercury, when the barometer stands at 30 inches, and that the pump gage stands at 29.95; then, in an ordinary pump, the valve in the piston will not rise till the piston has got within the 30th part of the bottom of the barrel, and it will leave the valve-hole filled with air of the ordinary density. But in this pump the valve will rise as soon as the piston quits the top of the barrel; and when it is quite down, the valve-hole \\( a \\) will contain only the 30th part of the air which it would have contained in a pump of the ordinary form. Suppose farther, that the barrel is of equal capacity with the receiver, and that both pumps are so badly constructed, that the space left below the piston is the 30th part of the barrel. In the common pump the piston valve will rise no more, and the rarefaction can be carried no farther, however delicate the barrel valve may be; but in this pump the next stroke will raise the gage to 29.95, and the piston valve will again rise as soon as the piston gets half way down the barrel.\n\nThe limit to the rarefaction by this pump depends chiefly on the space contained in the hole LK, and in the space \\( b c d \\) of the piston. When the piston is brought up to the top, and applied close to it, those spaces remain filled with air of the ordinary density, which will expand as the piston descends, and thus will retard the opening of the piston valve. The rarefaction will stop when the elasticity of this small quantity of air, expanded so as to fill the whole barrel (by the descent of the piston to the bottom), is just equal to the force requisite for opening the piston valve.\n\nAnother advantage attending this construction is, that in drawing up the piston, we are not assisted by worked the whole pressure of the air; because the air is rarefied above this piston as well as below it, and the piston is in precisely the same state of pressure as if connected with another piston in a double pump. The resistance to the ascent of the piston is the excess of the elasticity of the air above it over the elasticity of the air below; this,\nAir-pump: this, toward the end of the rarefaction, is very small, while the piston is near the bottom of the barrel, but gradually increases as the piston rises, and reduces the air above it into smaller dimensions, and becomes equal to the pressure of the atmosphere, when the air above the piston is of the common density. If we should raise the piston still farther, we must condense the air above it; but Mr Smeaton has here made an inlet for the air by a small hole in the top of the barrel, covered with a delicate valve. This allows the air to escape, and thus again as soon as the piston begins to descend, leaving almost a perfect void behind it as before.\n\nThis pump has another advantage. It may be changed in a moment from a rarefying to a condensing engine, by simply turning the cocks at Q and T. While T communicates with the open air and Q with the receiver, it is a rarefying engine or air-pump; but when T communicates with the receiver, and Q with the open air, it is a condensing engine.\n\nPlate CCCCXXXVI. Fig. 26. represents Mr Smeaton's air-pump as it is usually made by Naime. Upon a solid base or table are set up three pillars F, H, H: the pillar F supports the pump-plate A; and the pillars H, H, support the front or head, containing a brass cog-wheel, which is turned by the handle B, and works in the rack C fastened to the upper end of the piston rod. The whole is still farther secured by two pieces of brass c b and o k, which connect the pump-plate with the front, and have perforations communicating between the hole a in the middle of the plate and the barrel, as will be described immediately. D E is the barrel of the pump, firmly fixed to the table by screws thro' its upper flanch: e f d c is a slender brass tube screwed to the bottom of the barrel, and to the under hole of the horizontal canal c b. In this canal there is a cock which opens a communication between the barrel and the receiver, when the key is in the position represented here: but when the key is at right angles with this position, this communication is cut off. If that side of the key which is here drawn next to the pump-plate be turned outward, the external air is admitted into the receiver; but if turned inwards, the air is admitted into the barrel.\n\ng h Is another slender brass pipe, leading from the discharging valve at g to the horizontal canal h k, the under side of which it is screwed fast. In this horizontal canal there is a cock n which opens a passage from the barrel to the receiver when the key is in the position here drawn; but opens a passage from the barrel to the external air when the key is turned outwards, and from the receiver to the external air when the key is turned inwards. This communication with the external air is not immediate but through a sort of box i; the use of this box is to receive the oil which is discharged through the top valve g. In order to keep the pump tight, and in working order, it is proper sometimes to pour a tablespoonful of olive oil into the hole a of the pump-plate, and then to work the pump. The oil goes along the conduit b c d f e, gets into the barrel and through the piston-valve, when the piston is pressed to the bottom of the barrel, and is then drawn up, and forced through the discharging valve g along the pipe g h, the horizontal passage h n, and finally into the box i. This box has a small hole in its side near the top, through which the air escapes.\n\nFrom the upper side of the canals b there arises a slender pipe which bends outward and then turns downward, and is joined to a small box, which cannot be seen in this view. From the bottom of this box proceeds downwards the gage-pipe of glass, which enters the cistern of mercury G fixed below.\n\nOn the upper side of the other canal at o is seen a small stud, having a short pipe of glass projecting horizontally from it, close by and parallel to the front piece of the pump, and reaching to the other canal. This pipe is close to the farther end, and has a small drop of mercury or oil in it at the end o. This serves as a gage in condensing, indicating the degree of condensation by the place of the drop: For this drop is forced along the pipe, condensing the air before it in the same degree that it is condensed in the barrel and receiver.\n\nIn constructing this pump, Mr Smeaton introduced Method of a method of joining together the different pipes and other joining pieces, which has great advantages over the usual manner of screwing them together with leather between, and different which is now much used in hydraulic and pneumatic engines. We shall explain this to our readers by a description of the manner in which the exhausting gage is joined to the horizontal duct c b.\n\nThe piece h i p, in fig. 23, is the same with the little Fig. 25, cylinder observable on the upper side of the horizontal canal c d, in fig. 26. The upper part h i is formed in Fig. 26, to an outside screw, to fit the hollow screw of the piece d e e d. The top of this last piece has a hole in its middle, giving an easy passage to the bent tube c b a, so as to slip along it with freedom. To the end c of this bent tube is soldered a piece of brass f g, perforated in continuation of the tube, and having its end ground flat on the top of the piece h i p, and also covered with a slip of thin leather strained across it and pierced with a hole in the middle.\n\nIt is plain from this form, that if the surface f g be applied to the top of h i, and the cover d e e d be screwed down on it, it will draw or press them together, so that no air can escape by the joint, and this without turning the whole tube c b a round, as is necessary in the usual way. This method is now adopted for joining together the conducting pipes of the machines for extinguishing fires, an operation which was extremely troublesome before this improvement.\n\nThe conduit pipe E f c (fig. 26.) is fastened to the bottom of the barrel, and the discharging pipe g h to its top, in the same manner. But to return to the gage; the bent pipe c b a enters the box s t near one side, and obliquely, and the gage pipe q r is inserted through its bottom towards the opposite side. The use of this box is to catch any drops of mercury which may sometimes be dashed up through the gage pipe by an accidental oscillation. This, by going through the passages of the pump, would corrode them, and would act particularly on the joints, which are generally soldered with tin. When this happens to an air-pump, it must be cleaned with the most scrupulous attention, otherwise it will be quickly destroyed.\n\nThis account of Smeaton's pump is sufficient for enabling the reader to understand its operation and to see its superiority. It is reckoned a very fine pump of this kind, ordinary construction which will rarefy 200 times, or raise the gage to 29.85, the barometer standing at 30. But Mr Smeaton found, that his pump, even after long using, raised it to 29.95, which we consider as equivalent.\nAir-pump lent to rarefying 630 times. When in fine order, he found no bounds to its rarefaction, frequently raising the gage as high as the barometer; and he thought its performance so perfect, that the barometer-gage was not sufficiently delicate for measuring the rarefaction. He therefore substituted the syphon gage already described, which he gives some reasons for preferring; but even this he found not sufficiently sensible.\n\nHe contrived another, which could be carried to any degree of sensibility. It consisted of a glass body A (fig. 27.), of a pear shape, and was therefore called the pear-gage. This had a small projecting orifice at B, and at the other end a tube CD, whose capacity was the hundredth part of the capacity of the whole vessel. This was suspended at the flip-wire of the receiver, and there was set below it a small cup with mercury. When the pump was worked, the air in the pear-gage was raised along with the rest. When the rarefaction was brought to the degree intended, the gage was let down till B reached the bottom of the mercury. The external air being now let in, the mercury was raised into the pear, and stood at some height E in the tube CD. The length of this tube being divided into 100 parts, and those numbered from D, it is evident that DE will express the degree of rarefaction which had been produced when the gage was immersed into the mercury: or if DC be \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\) of the whole capacity, and be divided into 100 parts by a scale annexed to it, each unit of the scale will be \\( \\frac{1}{10000} \\) of the whole.\n\nThis was a very ingenious contrivance, and has been the means of making some very curious and important discoveries which at present engage the attention of philosophers. By this gage Mr Smeaton found, that his pump frequently raised a thousand, ten thousand, nay an hundred thousand times. But though he in every instance saw the great superiority of his pump above all others, he frequently found irregularities which he could not explain, and a want of correspondence between the pear and the barometer gages which puzzled him. The pear-gage frequently indicated a prodigious rarefaction, when the barometer-gage would not show more than 600.\n\nThese unaccountable phenomena excited the curiosity of philosophers, who by this time were making continual use of the air-pump in their meteorological researches, and much interested in everything connected with the state or constitution of elastic fluids. Mr Nairne, a most ingenious and accurate maker of philosophical instruments, made many curious experiments in the examination and comparison of Mr Smeaton's pump with those of the usual construction, attending to every circumstance which could contribute to the inferiority of the common pumps or to their improvement, so as to bring them nearer to this rival machine. This rigorous comparison brought into view several circumstances in the constitution of the atmospheric air, and its relation to other bodies, which are of the most extensive and important influence in the operations of nature. We shall notice at present such only as have a relation to the operation of the air-pump in extracting air from the receiver.\n\nMr Nairne found, that when a little water, or even bit of paper damped with water, was exposed under the receiver of Mr Smeaton's air-pump, when in the most perfect condition, raising the mercury in the barometer-gage to 29.95, he could not make it rise above 29.8 if Fahrenheit's thermometer indicated the temperature 47\u00b0, nor above 29.7 if the thermometer stood at 52\u00b0; and that to bring the gage to this height and keep it there, the operation of the pump must be continued for a long time after the water had disappeared or the paper become perfectly dry. He found that a drop of spirits, or paper moistened with spirits, could not in those circumstances allow the mercury in the gage to rise to near that height; and that similar effects followed from admitting any volatile body whatever into the receiver or any part of the apparatus.\n\nThis showed him at once how improper the directions were which had been given by Guericke, Boyle, Gravendael, and others, for fitting up the air-pump for the experiment, by soaking the leather in water, covering them with the joints with water, or in short, admitting water or water, any other volatile body near it.\n\nHe therefore took his pumps to pieces, cleared them of all the moisture which he could drive from them by utility of heat, and then leathered them anew with leather soaked oil and tallow, in a mixture of olive oil and tallow, from which he had expelled all the water it usually contains, by boiling it till the first frothing was over. When the pumps were fitted up in this manner, he uniformly found that Mr Smeaton's pump raised the gage to 29.95, and the best common pump to 29.87, the first of which he computed to indicate a rarefaction to 600, and the other to 230. But in this state he again found that a piece of damp paper, leather, wood, &c. in the receiver, reduced the performance in the same manner as before.\n\nBut the most remarkable phenomenon was, that when A remarkable he made use of the pear-gage with the pump cleared from all possible moisture, it indicated the same degree of rarefaction menon with the barometer-gage: but when he exposed a bit of paper moistened with spirits, and thus reduced the rarefaction of the pump to what he called 50, the barometer gage standing at 29.4, the pear-gage indicated a rarefaction exceeding 100,000; in short, it was not measurable; and this phenomenon was almost constant. Whenever he exposed any substance susceptible of evaporation, he found the rarefaction indicated by the barometer-gage greatly reduced, while that indicated by the pear-gage was prodigiously increased; and both these effects were more remarkable as the subject was of easier evaporation, or the temperature of the air of the chamber was warmer.\n\nThis uniform result suggested the true cause. Water accounted boils at the temperature 212, that is, it is then converted for into a vapour which is permanently elastic while of that temperature, and its elasticity balances the pressure of the atmosphere. If this pressure be diminished by rarefying the air above it, a low temperature will not allow it to be converted into elastic vapour, and keep it in that state. Water will boil in the receiver of an air-pump at the temperature 96, or even under it. Philosophers did not think of examining the state of the vapour in temperatures lower than what produced ebullition. But it now appears, that in much lower heats than this superficial water is converted into elastic vapour, which continues to exhale from it as long as the water lasts, and, supplying the place of air in the receiver.","sp":306,"ep":308},{"h":"THE SILVER PLATE IS GENERALLY MADE TO ADHERE TO THE BASER METAL BY","t":"e silver plate is generally made to adhere to the baser metal by means of folder, which is of two kinds, the soft and the hard, or the tin and silver folders. The former of these consists of tin alone, the latter generally of three parts of silver and one of brass. When a buckle, for instance, is to be plated by means of the soft folder, the ring, before it is bent, is first tinned, and then the silver-plate is gently hammered upon it, the hammer employed being always covered with a piece of cloth. The silver now forms, as it were, a mould to the ring, and whatever of it is not intended to be used is cut off. This mould is fastened to the ring of the buckle by two or three cramps of small iron wire; after which the buckle, with the plated side undermost, is laid upon a plate of iron sufficiently hot to melt the tin, but not the silver. The buckle is then covered with powdered resin or anointed with turpentine; and lest there should be a deficiency of tin, a small portion of rolled tin is likewise melted on it. The buckle is now taken off with a tongs, and commonly laid on a bed of sand, where the plate and the ring, while the folder is yet in a state of fusion, are more closely compressed by a smart stroke with a block of wood. The buckle is afterwards bent and finished.\n\nSometimes the melted tin is poured into the silver mould, which has been previously rubbed over with some flux. The buckle ring is then put among the melted tin, and the plating finished. This is called by the workmen filling up.\n\nWhen the hard folder is employed, the process is in many respects different. Before the plate is fitted to the iron or other metal, it is rubbed over with a solution of borax. Strips of silver are placed along the joinings of the plate; and instead of two or three cramps, as in the former case, the whole is wrapped round with small wire; the folder and joinings are again rubbed with the borax, and the whole put into a charcoal fire till the folder be in fusion. When taken out, the wire is instantly removed, the plate is cleaned by the application of some acid, and afterwards made smooth by the strokes of a hammer.\nMetal plating is when a bar of silver and copper are taken of at least one equal side. The equal sides are made smooth, and the two bars fastened together by wire wrapped round them. These bars are then sweated in a charcoal fire, and after sweating, they adhere as closely together as if they were soldered. After this they are flattened into a plate between two rollers, when the copper appears on one side and the silver on the other. This sort of plate is named plated metal.\n\nFrench plating is when silver-leaf is burnished on a piece of metal in a certain degree of heat.\n\nWhen silver is dissolved in aquafortis, and precipitated upon another metal, the process is called silvering.

The natural historian attempts in vain to describe objects, by only informing us of their shape, colour, and other sensible qualities. He finds himself obliged, in describing a piece of marble, for instance, to tell us that it takes a fine polish; that it strikes fire with steel; that it burns to quicklime; that it dissolves in aquafortis, and is precipitated by alkalies; that with vitriolic acid it makes gypsum, &c., &c., &c.; and thus it appears that even the description of any thing, with the view of ascertaining its specific nature, and with the sole purpose of discrimination, cannot be accomplished without taking notice of its various relations to other things. But what do we mean by the nature of any thing? We are ignorant of its essence, or what makes it that thing and no other thing. We must content ourselves with the discovery of its qualities or properties; and it is the assemblage of these which we call its nature. But this is very inaccurate. These do not constitute its essence, but are the consequences of it. Yet this is all we shall ever know of its nature.\n\nNow the term property is nothing but a name expressing some relation which the substance under consideration has to other things. This is true of all such terms. Gravity, elasticity, flexibility, gratitude, and the like, express nothing but certain matters of fact, which may be observed reflecting the object of our contemplation in different circumstances of situation with regard to other things. Our distinct notions of individuals, therefore, imply their relations to other things.\n\nThe slightest observation of the universe shows an evident connection between all its parts in their various properties. All things on this earth are connected with each other by the laws of motion and of mind. We are connected with the whole of the solar system by gravitation. If we extend our observations to the fixed stars, the connection seems to fail; but even here their value may be observed. Their inconceivable distance, it is true, renders it impossible for us to obtain any extensive information as to their nature. But these bodies are connected with the solar system by the fames of the light which they emit with that emitted by our sun or any shining body. It moves with the same velocity, it confits (in most of them at least) of the same colours, and it is reflected, refracted, and inflected, according to the same laws.\n\nIn this unbounded scene of contemplation, our attention will be directed to the different classes of objects nearly in proportion to the interest we take in them. There is nothing in which we are so much interested as our fellow men; and one of the first steps towards that we make in our knowledge of nature, is an acquaintance with them. We learn their distinctive nature by attending to their characteristic appearances; that is, by observing their actions. We observe them continually producing, like ourselves, certain changes in the situation or condition of surrounding objects; and these changes are evidently directed to certain ends which respect themselves. Observing this subordination of the effects which they produce to their own accommodation, we consider this adjustment of means to ends as the effect of an INTENTION, as we experience it to be in our own case, where we are conscious of this intention, and of these its effects. We therefore interpret those actions of other men, where we observe this Nature of adjustment of means to ends, as marks or signs of intention in them similar to our own. And thus a quality, or power, or faculty, is supposed in them by means of its sign, although the quality itself is not immediately cognizable by our senses. And as this intention in ourselves is accompanied by perception of external objects, knowledge of their properties, desire of good, aversion from evil, volition, and exertion, without all of which we could not or would not perform the actions which we daily perform, we suppose the same perception, knowledge, desire, aversion, volition, and exertion in them.\n\nThus, by the constitution of our mind, we consider the employment of means, by which ends terminating in the agent are gained, as the natural signs of design or intention. ART, therefore, or the employment of means, is the natural sign of intention; and wherever we observe this adjustment of means to ends, we infer the agency of design.\n\nA small acquaintance with the objects around us, obliges us to extend this inference to a great number of beings besides our fellow men, namely, to the whole animal\nanimal creation: for in all we observe the same sub-\nserviency to the ends of the agent, in the changes\nwhich we find them continually producing in the ob-\njects around them. These changes are all adjusted to\ntheir own well-being. In such cases, therefore, we\nare forced, by the constitution of our own minds, to infer\nthe existence of design or intention in these beings also.\n\nBut in numberless changes produced by external ob-\njects on each other, we observe no such fitness in the\neffects, no such subserviency to the well-being of the\nagent. In such cases, therefore, we make no such in-\nference of thought or design.\n\nThus, then, there is presented to our observation an\nimportant distinction, by which we arrange all exter-\nnal objects into two classes. The first resembles our-\nselves, in giving external marks of that thought or in-\ntention of which we are conscious; and we suppose in\nthem the other properties which we discover in our-\nselves, but cannot immediately observe in them, viz.\nthought, perception, memory, forethought, and all that\ncollection of faculties which we feel in ourselves, and\nwhich constitute the animal. The other class of objects\nexhibits no such appearances, and we make no such in-\nference. And thus we divide the whole of external nature\ninto the classes of THINKING and UNTHINKING beings.\n\nOur first judgements about these classes will be very\ninaccurate; and we will naturally ascribe the differ-\nences, which we do not very well understand, to the\ndifferences in organic structure, which we clearly ob-\nserve. But when we have knocked down or perhaps\nsmothered an animal, we find that it no longer gives\nthe former marks of thought and intention, and that it\nnow resembles the class of unthinking beings: And yet\nit still retains all that fitness of organic structure which\nit had before; it seems only to want the intention and\nthe will. This obliges us to conclude that the distinc-\ntion does not arise from a difference in organic struc-\nture, but from a distinct substance common to all think-\ning beings, but separable from their organic frame.\nTo this substance we ascribe thought, intention, contriv-\nance, and all that collection of faculties which we feel\nin ourselves. To this substance in ourselves we refer all\nsensations, pleasures, pains, remembrances, desires, pur-\nposes; and to this aggregate, however imperfectly un-\nderstood, we give the name MIND. Our organic frame,\nwhich seems to be only the instrument of informa-\ntion and operation to the mind, we call our body.\n\nAs the animating principle is not, like our body, the\nimmediate object of the senses, we naturally conceive\nit to be a substance essentially different from those which\nare the objects of our senses. The rudest people have\nshown a disposition to form this conclusion. Observing\nthat animal life was connected with breathing, it was\nnatural to imagine that breathing was living, and that\nbreath was life. It is a remarkable fact, that in most\nlanguages the term for expressing breath is at least one\nof the terms for expressing the soul; \u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1, \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae,\nin the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, expresses both;\n\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7, or \u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, in the Teutonic, comes from g\u0113leifan, to\n\"breathe or sigh;\" duchia or duha, \"the soul,\" in Sla-\nvonic, comes from duchet, \"to breathe;\" fo in the\nGaelic does anal come from annam; and the same rela-\ntion is found between the two words in the Malay and\nother eastern languages. We believe that most persons\ncan recollect some traces of this notion in their early\nconceptions of things; and many who do not consider\nthemselves as uncultivated, believe that the soul quits\nthe body along with the last breath. Among the Tar-\ntar nations hanging is considered with particular horror,\non account of the ungraceful and filthy exit which the\nsoul is obliged to make from the body.\n\nBut the observation of the same appearances of Their opi-\nnion and intention in fishes and other animals, which do not\nbreathe, would soon show that this was unjust, but a rude conception. Very little refinement indeed\nis necessary to convince us that air or breath cannot\nbe the substance which thinks, wishes, and designs;\nand that the properties of this substance, whatever it\nis, must be totally different from, and incompatible\nwith, any thing that we know of the immediate objects\nof our senses.\n\nHence we are led to conclude that there are two Of the two\nkinds of substances in nature: One, which is the prin-\ncipal of sensation; and therefore cannot be the object of\none of our senses, any more than light can be the object of\none of the microscope. This substance alone can feel, think, object of\ndefine, and propose, and is the object of reflection alone. reflection\nThe objects of our senses compose the other clas, and alone, the\ntherefore can have none of the other properties which other of the\nare not cognoscible by the senses. These have all the\nproperties which our senses can discover; and we can\nhave no evidence of their having any other, nor indeed\nany conception of their having them. This clas is not\nconfined to the unorganized masses of matter; for\nwe see that the bodies of animals lose after death that\norganic form, and are assimilated to all the rest of\nunthinking beings. It has arisen from such views as\nthis, that while all nations have agreed to call this\nclass of objects by the name BODY, which originally\nexpresses our organic frame, some nations, farther ad-\nvanced in cultivation or refinement, have contrived an\nabstract term to express this general substance of which\nall inanimate beings are composed. Such a term we\nhave in the words materies, idem.\n\nMatter, then, is that substance which is immediate-The distinc-\ntion is not thus immediately cognoscible by our senses between ma-\nterial and called immaterial: hence it is that mind is said to be substances\nimmaterial. It is of importance to keep in mind this very im-\nportance, merely grammatical. Little more is ne-\ncessary for detecting the sophisms of Helvetius, Mira-\nbeau, and other sages of the Gallic school, who have\nbeen anxious to remove the ties of moral and religious\nobligation by lowering our conceptions of our intel-\nlectual nature. It will also serve to show how hastily\nthey have formed their opinions who have ascribed to\nthe immediate agency of mind all those relations which\nare observed in the actions of bodies on each other at\na distance. The connecting principles of such rela-\ntions \u00e9 distante (if there be any such), are not the im-\nmediate objects of our senses: they are therefore im-\nmaterial. But it does not follow that they are minds.\nThere may be many immaterial substances which are\nnot minds. We know nothing of any object what-\never but by the observation of certain appearances,\nwhich suggest to our minds the existence and agency\nof its qualities or powers. Such phenomena are the\nnatural signs of these qualities, and it is to these signs\nthat we must always have recourse when we wish to\nconceive without ambiguity concerning them. What is the characteristic phenomenon of mind, or what is the distinguishing quality which brings it into view? It is intention: and it may be asserted with the utmost confidence, that we have no other mark by which mind is immediately suggested to us, or that would ever have made us suppose that there existed another mind besides our own. The phenomenon by which this quality is suggested to us is art, or the employment of means to gain ends; and the mark of art is the supposed conduciveness of these ends to the well-being of the agent. Where this train is not observed, design or intention is never thought of; and therefore where intention is not perceived in any immaterial substance, if any such has ever been observed, it is an abuse of language to call it mind. We do not think that even perception and intelligence entitle us to give the name mind to the substance in which they are inherent, because it is from marks of intention alone that we infer the existence of mind; and although these must be accompanied with perception and intelligence, it does not follow that the substance which can perceive and understand must also desire and propose. However difficult we may find it to separate them, they are evidently separable in imagination. And let not this assertion be too hastily objected to; for the separation has been made by persons most eminent for their knowledge and discernment. When Leibnitz ascribed to his monads, or what we call the ultimate atoms of matter, a perception of their situation in the universe, and a motion precisely suited to this perception, he was the fartherest in the world from supposing them animated or endowed with minds. It is true indeed, that others, who think and call themselves philosophers, are much more liberal in their application of this term. A modern author of great metaphysical eminence says, \"I call that mind which moves, and that body which is moved.\" This class of philosophers assert that no motion whatever is begun except by the agency of an animating principle, which (after Aristotle) they call Nature, and which has in these days been exalted to the rank of a god. All this jargon (for it is nothing else) has arisen from the puzzle in which naturalists think themselves involved in attempting to explain the production of motion in a body at a distance from that body which is conceived as the cause of this motion. After having been reluctantly obliged, by the reasonings of Newton, to abandon their methods of explaining such phenomena by the impulse of an intervening fluid, nothing seemed left but the assertion that these motions were produced by minds, as in the case of our own exertions. These explanations (if they deserve the name) cannot be objected to in any other way than as an abuse of language, and as the introduction of an unmeaning jargon. We have, and can have, no notion of mind different from those of our own minds; and we discover the existence of other minds as we discover the existence of bodies, by means of phenomena which are characteristic of minds, that is, which resemble those phenomena that follow the exertion of our own mental faculties, that is, by the employment of means to attain selfish ends; and where such appearances are not observed, no existence of a mind is inferred. When we see a man fall from the top of a house, and dash out his brains on the pavement, we never ascribe this motion to his mind. Although the fitness of many of the celestial motions for most important purposes makes us suppose design and contrivance somewhere, and therefore a Supreme Mind, we no more think of inferring a mind in the earth from the fitness of its motions for purposes most beneficial to its inhabitants, than of inferring a mind in a bit of bread from its fitness for nourishing our bodies. It is not from the mere motions of animals that their minds are inferred, but from the conduciveness of these motions to the well-being of the animal.\n\nThe mind therefore, in the ordinary language of all men, is applied to what desires and wills at the same time that it perceives and understands. If we desire to call that mind which produces motion, we must derive it from our notions of its qualities or attributes from observing that which their effects. We must therefore discover the general laws by which they act, that is, the general laws observed in those motions which we consider as their effects. Now these are the general laws of motion; and in none of these can we find the least coincidence with what we are accustomed to call the laws of mind. Nay, it has been the total want of similarity which has given rise to the distinction which all men, in all ages and countries, have made between mind and matter. This distinction is found in all languages; and it is an unpardonable liberty which men take with language when they use a term of distinction, a specific term, to express things of a different species. What these authors have been pleased to call mind, the whole world besides have called by another name, force; which, though borrowed from our own exertions, is yet sufficiently distinctive, and never leads us to confound things that are different, except in the language of some modern philosophers, who apply it to the laws of the agency of mind; and, when speaking of the force of motives, &c., commit the same mistakes which the followers of Aristotle commit in the use of the term mind. Force, in the language of these philosophers, means what connects the operations of mind; as mind, in the language of Lord Monboddo, is that which connects the operations of body.\n\nThose are not less to blame who consider this Nature, the principle of Aristotle, this principle of motion, as an existence of or substance different both from matter and from the distinct minds of intelligent creatures. Aristotle calls it in form from matter places \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2. He might with equal propriety, and mind, \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f22 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. Besides, we have no evidence for the separability of this \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 from body as we have for the separability of such minds as our own, the genuine \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2. Nay, his whole doctrines, when maturely considered, assume their absolute inseparability.\n\nThis doctrine of elemental minds, therefore, as the immediate causes of the phenomena of the material world, is an abuse of language. It is a jargon; and it language, is a frivolous abuse, for it offers no explanation whatever. The phenomena are totally unlike the phenomena of ordinary minds, and therefore receive no explanation from them; and since our knowledge of these quasi-minds must be derived entirely from the phenomena, it will be precisely the same, although we express it in common language. We shall not indeed raise the wonder of our hearers, as those do who fill the world with minds which they never suspected to exist; but we shall\nnot bewilder their imaginations, confound their ideas, and mislead their judgements.\n\nWe flatter ourselves that our readers will not think these observations unseasonable or misplaced. Of all mistakes that the naturalist can fall into, there is none more fatal to his progress in knowledge than the confounding things which are essentially different; and of all the distinctions which can be made among the objects of our contemplation, there is none of equal philosophical importance with this between mind and matter: And when we consider the consequences which naturally follow from this confusion of ideas, and particularly those which follow from linking the mental faculties of man to a level with the operations of mechanics or chemistry, consequences which the experience of the present eventful day shows to be destructive of all that is noble or desirable in human nature, and of all that is comfortable in this life, and which blasts every hope of future excellence\u2014we cannot be too anxious to have this capital distinction put in the plainest point of view, and expressed in the most familiar characters, \"so that he who runneth may read.\" When we see the frenzy which the reasoning pride of man has raised in our neighbourhood, and hear the dictates of philosophy incessantly appealed to in defence of whatever our hearts shudder at as shocking and abominable; and when we see a man (A), of great reputation as a naturalist, and of professed humanity and political moderation, congratulating his countrymen on the rapid improvement and almost perfection of philosophy; and after giving a short sketch of the constitution of the visible universe, summing up all with a table of elective attractions, and that particular combination and mode of crystallization which constitutes God (horrefac referens!);\u2014is it not full time for us to stop short, and to ask our own hearts \"whither are you wandering?\"\u2014But found philosophy, reasoning from effects to their causes, will here listen to the words of our sacred oracles: \"By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\" The absurd consequences of the sceptical philosophy of Berkeley and Hume have been thought, by men of undoubted discernment, sufficient reasons for rejecting it without examination. The useless absurd and the shocking consequences of the mechanical philosophy now in vogue should give us the same abhorrence; and should make us abandon its blood-stained road, and return to the delightful paths of nature, to survey the works of God, and feast our eyes with the displays of mind, which offer themselves on every hand in designs of the most extensive influence and the most beautiful contrivance. Following the guidance of heavenly wisdom, we shall indeed find, that \"all her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\"\n\nSuch is the scene of our observation, the subject of philosophical study. Its extent is almost unbounded, reaching from an atom to God himself. It is absolutely necessary for the successful cultivation of this immense field of knowledge, that it be committed to the care of different cultivators, and that its various portions be treated in different ways: and, accordingly, the various talts of men have given this curiosity different directions; and the study, like all other tasks, has been promoted by this division of labour.\n\nSome philosophers have attended only to the appearances of fitness which are exhibited in every quarter of the universe; and by arranging these into different classes, and interpreting them as indications of thought and intention, have acquired the knowledge of many classes of sentient and intelligent beings, actuated by propensities, and directed by reason.","sp":23,"ep":26},{"h":"THIS COMBINATION OF AIR WITH WATER IS VERY DISTINCTLY SEEN BY","t":"s combination of air with water is very distinctly seen by means of the air-pump. If a small glass containing cold water, fresh drawn from the spring, be exposed, as in fig. 60, under the receiver, and the air rarefied, small bubbles will be observed to form on the inner surface of the glass, or on the surface of any body immersed in it, which will increase in size, and then detach themselves from the glass and reach the top; as the rarefaction advances, the whole water begins to show very minute air-bubbles rising to the top; and this appearance will continue for a very long time, till it be completely disengaged. Warming the water will occasion a still farther separation of air, and a boiling heat will separate all that can be disengaged. The reason assigned for these air-bubbles first appearing on the surface of the glass, &c., is, that air is attracted by bodies, and adheres to their surface. This may be so. But it is more probably owing to the attraction of the water for the glass, which causes it to quit the air which it held in solution, in the same manner as we see it happen when it is mixed with spirits-of-wine, with nitric acid, &c., or when salts or sugar are dissolved in it. For if we pour out the water which has been purged of air by boiling in vacuo, and fill the glass with fresh water, we shall observe the same thing, although a film of the purified water was left adhering to the glass. In this case there can be no air adhering to the glass.\n\nWater thus purged of air by boiling (or even without boiling) in vacuo, will again absorb air when exposed to the atmosphere. The best demonstration of this is to fill with this water a phial, leaving about the size of a pea not filled. Immerse this in a vessel of water, with the mouth undermost, by which means the air-bubble will mount up to the bottom of the phial. After some days standing in this condition, the air-bubble will be completely absorbed, and the vessel quite filled with water.\n\nThe air in this state of chemical solution has lost its elasticity, for the water is not more compressible than common water. It is also found that water brought up from a great depth underground contains much more air than water at the surface. Indeed fountain waters differ exceedingly in this respect. The water which now comes into the city of Edinburgh by pipes contains so much as to throw it into a considerable ebullition in vacuo. Other liquors contain much greater quantities of elastic fluids in this loofly combined state. A glass of beer treated in the same way will be almost wholly converted into froth by the escape of its fixed air, and will have lost entirely the prickling smartness which is so agreeable, and become quite void.\n\nThe air-pump gives us, in the next place, a great variety of experiments illustrative of the air's elasticity and irritates the expansibility. The very operation of exhaustion, as it is called, is an instance of its great, and hitherto unexpansible, limited, expansibility. But this is not palpably exhibited, to view. The following experiments show it most distinctly.\n\n1st. Put a flaccid bladder, of which the neck is Experimentally tied with a thread, under a receiver, and workments the pump. The bladder will gradually swell, and will showing even be fully distended. Upon readmitting the air, the properties into its former dimensions: while the bladder is flaccid, the air within it is of the same density and elasticity with the surrounding air, and its elasticity balances the pressure of the atmosphere. When part of the air of\nof the receiver is abstracted, the remainder expands so as still to fill the receiver; but by expanding, its elasticity is plainly diminished; for we see by the fact, that the elasticity of the air of the receiver no longer balances the elasticity of that in the bladder, as it no longer keeps it in its dimensions. The air in the bladder expands also; it expands till its diminished elasticity is again in equilibrium with the diminished elasticity of the air in the receiver; that is, till its density is the same. When all the wrinkles of the bladder have disappeared, its air can expand no more, although we continue to diminish the elasticity of the air of the receiver by further rarefaction. The bladder now tends to burst; and if it be pierced by a point or knife fastened to the flip-wire, the air will rush out, and the mercury descend rapidly in the gage.\n\nIf a phial or tube be partly filled with water, and immersed in a vessel of water with the mouth downwards, the air will occupy the upper part of the phial. If this apparatus be put under a receiver, and the air be abstracted, the air in the phial will gradually expand, allowing the water to run out by its weight till the surface of the water be on a level within and without. When this is the case, we must grant that the density and elasticity of the air in the phial is the same with that in the receiver. When we work the pump again, we shall observe the air in the phial expand still more, and come out of the water in bubbles. Continuing the operation, we shall see the air continually escaping from the phial: when this is over, it flows that the pump can rafry no more. If we now admit the air into the receiver, we shall see the water rise into the phial, and at last almost completely fill it, leaving only a very small bubble of air at top. This bubble had expanded so as to fill the whole phial. See this represented in fig. 61.\n\nEvery one must have observed a cavity at the big end of an egg between the shell and the white. The white and yolk are contained in a thin membrane or bladder which adheres loosely to the shell, but is detached from it at that part; and this cavity increases by keeping the egg in a dry place. One may form a judgment of its size, and therefore of the freshness of the egg, by touching it with the tongue; for the shell, where it is not in contact with the contents, will presently feel warm, being quickly heated by the tongue, while the rest of the egg will feel cold.\n\nIf a hole be made in the opposite end of the egg, and it be set on a little tripod, and put under a receiver, the expansion of the air in the cavity of the egg will force the contents through the hole till the egg be quite emptied: or, if nearly one half of the egg be taken away at the other end, and the white and yolk taken out, and the shell be put under a receiver, and the air abstracted, the air in the cavity of the egg will expand, gradually detaching the membrane from the shell, till it causes it to swell out, and gives the whole the appearance of an entire egg. In like manner shrivelled apples and other fruits will swell in vacuo by the expansion of the air confined in their cavities.\n\nIf a piece of wood, a twig with green leaves, charcoal, plaster of Paris, &c., be kept under water in vacuo, a prodigious quantity of air will be extracted; and if we readmit the air into the receiver, it will force the water into the pores of the body. In this case the body will not twin in water as it did before, showing that the vegetable fibres are specifically heavier than water. It is found, however, that the air contained in the pith and bark, such as cork, is not all extricated in this way; and that much of it is contained in vessels which have no outlet: being secreted into them in the process of vegetation, as it is secreted into the air-bladder of fishes, where it is generally found in a pretty compressed state, considerably denser than the surrounding air. The air-bladder of a fish is surrounded by circular and longitudinal muscles, by which the fish can compress the air still further; and, by ceasing to act with them, allow it to swell out again. It is in this manner that the fish can suit its specific gravity to its situation in the water, so as to have no tendency either to rise or sink: but if the fish be put into the receiver of an air-pump, the rarefaction of the air obliges the fish to act more strongly with these contracting muscles, in order to adjust its specific gravity; and if too much air has been abstracted from the receiver, the fish is no longer able to keep its air-bladder in the proper degree of compression. It becomes therefore too buoyant, and comes to the top of the water, and is obliged to struggle with its tail and fins in order to get down; frequently in vain. The air-bladder sometimes bursts, and the fish goes to the bottom, and can no longer keep above without the continual action of its tail and fins. When fishes die, they commonly float at top, their contractive action being now at an end.\n\nAll this may be illustrated (but very imperfectly) by a small half blown bladder, to which is appended a bit of lead, just so heavy as to make it sink in water: when this is put under a receiver, and the air abstracted, the bubble will rise to the top; and, by nicely adjusting the rarefaction, it may be kept at any height. See fig. 62.\n\nThe playthings called Carteian devils are similar to this: they are hollow glass figures, having a small aperture in the lower part of the figures, as at the point of the foot; their weight is adjusted so that they swim upright in water. When put into a tall jar filled to the top, and having a piece of leather tied over it, they will sink in the water, by pressing on the leather with the ball of the hand: this, by compressing the water, forces some of it to enter into the figure and makes it heavier than the water; for which reason it sinks, but rises again on removing the pressure of the hand. See figs. 63 and 64.\n\nIf a half blown ox-bladder be put into a box, and great weights laid on it, and the whole be put under a receiver, and the air abstracted; the air will, by expanding, lift up the weights, though above an hundred pounds. See fig. 65.\n\nBy such experiments the great expansibility of the air is abundantly illustrated, as its compressibility was formerly by means of the condensing syringe. We now see that the two sets of experiments form an uninterrupted chain; and that there is no particular state of the air's density where the compressibility and expansibility are remarkably dissimilar. Air in its ordinary state expands; because its ordinary state is a state of compression by the weight of the atmosphere: and if there were a pit about 33 miles deep, the air at the bottom would probably be as dense as water; and if it were 50 miles deep, it would be as dense as gold, if it did not become a liquid before this depth: nay, if a bottle with its mouth undermost were immersed five miles under water, it would probably be as dense as water; we say probably,\nprobably, for this depends on the nature of its compressibility; that is, on the relation which subsists between the compression and the force which produces it.\n\nThis is the circumstance of its constitution, which we now proceed to examine; and it is evidently a very important circumstance. We have long ago observed, that the great compressibility and permanent fluidity of air, observed in a vast variety of phenomena, is totally inexplicable, on the supposition that the particles of air are like so many balls of sponge or so many foot-balls. Give to those what compressibility you please, common air could no more be fluid than a mass of clay; it could no more be fluid than a mass of such balls pressed into a box. It can be demonstrated (and indeed hardly needs a demonstration), that before a parcel of such balls, just touching each other, can be squeezed into half their present dimensions, their globular shape will be entirely gone, and each will have become a perfect cube, touching six other cubes with its whole surface; and these cubes will be strongly compressed together, so that motion could never be performed through among them by any solid body without a very great force. Whereas we know that in this state air is just as permeable to every body as the common air that we breathe. There is no way in which we can represent this fluidity to our imagination, but by conceiving air to consist of particles, not only discrete, but distant from each other, and actuated by repulsive forces, or something analogous to them. It is an idle subterfuge, to which some naturalists have recourse, saying, that they are kept asunder by an intervening ether, or elastic fluid of any other name. This is only removing the difficulty a step farther off; for the elasticity of this fluid requires the same explanation; and therefore it is necessary, in obedience to the rules of just reasoning, to begin the inquiry here; that is, to determine from the phenomena what is the analogy between the distances of the particles and the repulsive forces exerted at these distances, proceeding in the same way as in the examination of planetary gravitation. We shall learn the analogy by attending to the analogy between the compressing force and the density.\n\nFor the density depends on the distance between the particles; the nearer they are to each other, the denser is the air. Suppose a square pipe one inch wide and eight inches long, shut at one end, and filled with common air; then suppose a plug so nicely fitted to this pipe that no air can pass by its sides; suppose this piston thrust down to within an inch of the bottom: it is evident that the air which formerly filled the whole pipe now occupies the space of one cubic inch, which contains the same number of particles as were formerly diffused over eight cubic inches.\n\nThe condensation would have been the same if the air which fills a cube whose side is two inches had been squeezed into a cube of one inch, for the cube of two inches also contains eight inches. Now, in this case it is evident that the distance between the particles would be reduced to its half in every direction. In like manner, if a cube whose side is three inches, and which therefore contains 27 inches, be squeezed into one inch, the distance of the particles will be one-third of what it was: in general the distance of the particles will be as the cube-root of the space into which they are compressed. If the space be $\\frac{1}{8}$, $\\frac{1}{27}$, $\\frac{1}{64}$, $\\frac{1}{125}$, &c., of its former dimensions, the distance of the particles will be $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{5}$, &c. Now the term density, in its strict sense, expresses the vicinity of the particles; dense arbors are trees growing near each other. The measure of this vicinity therefore is the true measure of the density; and when 27 inches of air are compressed into one, we should say that it is three times as dense; but we say, that it is 27 times denser.\n\nDensity is therefore used in a sense different from its farthest acceptation: it expresses the comparative number of equidistant particles contained in the same bulk. This is also abundantly precise, when we compare bodies of the same kind, differing in density only; but we also say, that gold is 19 times denser than water, because the same bulk of it is 19 times heavier. This affront proceeds on the assumption, or the fact, that every ultimate atom of terrestrial matter is equally heavy: a particle of gold may contain more or fewer atoms of matter than a particle of water. In such a case, therefore, the term density has little or no reference to the vicinity of the particles; and is only a term of comparison of other qualities or accidents.\n\nBut when we speak of the respective densities of the same substance in its different states of compression, the word density is strictly connected with vicinity of particles, and we may safely take either of the measures. We shall abide by the common acceptation, and call that air, eight times as dense which has eight times as many particles in the same bulk, although the particles are only twice as near to each other.\n\nThus then we see, that by observing the analogy between the compressing force and the density, we shall discover the analogy between the compressing force and the distance of the particles. Now the force which is necessary for compressing two particles of air to a certain distance is a proper measure of the elasticity of the distance of particles corresponding to that vicinity or distance; for it balances it, and forces which balance must be esteemed equal. Elasticity is a distinctive name for that corporeal force which keeps the particles at that distance: therefore observations made on the analogy between the compressing force and the density of air will give us the law of its corporeal force, in the same way that observations on the simultaneous deflections of the planets towards the sun give us the law of celestial gravitation.\n\nBut the sensible compressing forces which we are able to apply is at once exerted on unknown thousands of particles, while it is the law of action of a single particle that we want to discover. We must therefore know the proportion of the numbers of particles on which the compressing force is exerted. It is easy to see, that since the distance of the particles is as the cube root of the density inversely, the number of particles in physical contact with the compressing surface must be as the square of this root. Thus when a cube of 8 inches is compressed into one inch, and the particles are twice as near each other as they were before, there must be four times the number of particles in contact with each of the sides of this cubical inch; or, when we have pushed down the square piston of the pipe spoken of above to within an inch of the bottom, there will be four times the number of particles immediately contiguous to the piston, and resisting the compression; and in order to obtain the force really exerted on one particle, and the elasticity of that particle, we must divide the whole compressing\npressing force by 4. In like manner, if we have compressed air into \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of its former bulk, and brought the particles to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of their former distance, we must divide the compressing force by 9. In general if \\( d \\) expresses the density, \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{d}} \\) will express the distance \\( x \\) of the particles; \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{d}} \\), or \\( d^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), will express the vicinity or real density; and \\( d^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\) will express the number of particles acting on the compressing surface: and if \\( f \\) expresses the accumulated external compressing force, \\( \\frac{f}{d^{\\frac{2}{3}}} \\) will express the force acting on one particle; and therefore the elasticity of that particle corresponding to the distance \\( x \\).\n\nWe may now proceed to consider the experiments by which the law of compression is to be established.\n\nThe first experiments to this purpose were those made by Mr Boyle, published in 1661 in his \"Defensio Doctrinae de A\u00ebris Elatere contra Linum,\" and exhibited before the Royal Society the year before. Mariotte made experiments of the same kind, which were published in 1676 in his \"Essai sur la Nature de l'Air et Trait\u00e9 des Mouvements des Eaux.\" The most copious experiments are those by Sulzer (Mem. Berlin. ix.), those by Fontana (Opuscula Physico-Math.), and those by Sir George Shuckburgh and Gen. Roy.\n\nIn order to examine the compressibility of air that is not rarer than the atmosphere at the surface of the earth, we employ a bent tube or syphon ABCD (fig. 66.), hermetically sealed at A and open at D. The short leg AB must be very accurately divided in the proportion of its solid contents, and fitted with a scale whose units denote equal increments, not of length, but of capacity. There are various ways of doing this; but it requires the most scrupulous attention, and without this the experiments are of no value. In particular, the arched form at A must be noticed. A small quantity of mercury must then be poured into the tube, and passed backwards and forwards till it stands (the tube being held in a vertical position) on a level at B and C. Then we are certain that the included air is of the same density with that of the contiguous atmosphere. Mercury is now poured into the leg DC, which will fill it, suppose to G, and will compress the air into a smaller space AE. Draw the horizontal line EF: the new bulk of the compressed air is evidently AE, measured by the adjacent scale, and the addition made to the compressing force of the atmosphere is the weight of the column GF. Produce GF downwards to H, till FH is equal to the height shown by a Torricellian tube filled with the same mercury; then the whole compressing force is HG. This is evidently the measure of the elasticity of the compressed air in AE, for it balances it. Now pour in more mercury, and let it rise to g, compressing the air into Ae. Draw the horizontal line ef, and make fh equal to FH; then Ae will be the new bulk of the compressed air, \\( \\frac{AB}{Ae} \\) will be its new density, and \\( \\frac{hg}{AE} \\) will be the measure of the new elasticity. This operation may be extended as far as we please, by lengthening the tube CD, and taking care that it be strong enough to resist the great pressure. Great care must be taken to keep the whole in a constant temperature, because the elasticity of air is greatly affected by heat, and the change by any increase of temperature is different according to its density or compression.\n\nThe experiments of Boyle, Mariotte, Amontons, and others, were not extended to very great compressions, the density of the air not having been quadrupled in any of them; nor do they seem to have been made with very nice apparatus. It may be collected from them generally, that the elasticity of the air is very nearly proportional to its density; and accordingly this law was almost immediately acquiesced in, and was called the Boylean law: it is accordingly assumed by almost all writers on the subject as exact. Of late years, however, there occurred questions in which it was of importance that this point should be more scrupulously settled, and the former experiments were repeated and extended. Sulzer and Fontana have carried them farther than any other. Sulzer compressed air into one-eighth of its former dimensions.\n\nConsiderable varieties and irregularities are to be observed in their experiments. It is extremely difficult to preserve the temperature of the apparatus, particularly of the leg AB, which is most handled. A great quantity of mercury must be employed; and it does not appear that philosophers have been careful to have it precisely similar to that in the barometer, which gives us the unit of compressing force and of elasticity. The mercury in the barometer should be pure and boiled. If the mercury in the syphon is adulterated with bismuth and tin, which it commonly is to a considerable degree, the compressing force, and consequently the elasticity, will appear greater than the truth. If the barometer has not been nicely fitted, it will be lower than it should be, and the compressing force will appear too great, because the unit is too small; and this error will be most remarkable in the smaller compressions.\n\nThe greatest source of error and irregularity in the heterogeneous nature of the air itself. Air is a solvent of all fluids, all vapours, and air the perhaps of many solid bodies. It is highly improbable that the different compounds shall have the same elasticity, or even the same law of elasticity: and it is well known, that air, loaded with water or other volatile bodies, is much more expansible by heat than pure air; nay, it would appear from many experiments, that certain determinate changes both of density and of temperature, cause air to let go the vapours which it holds in solution. Cold causes it to precipitate water, as appears in dew; so does rarefaction, as is seen in the receiver of an air-pump.\n\nIn general, it appears that the elasticity of air does not increase quite so fast as its density. This will be best seen by the following tables, calculated from the increase of experiments of Mr Sulzer. The column E in each fast as its feet of experiments expresses the length of the column density, GH, the unit being FH, while the column D expresses \\( \\frac{AB}{AE} \\).\nThere appears in these experiments sufficient grounds for calling in question the Boylean law; and the writer of this article thought it incumbent on him to repeat them with some precautions, which probably had not been attended to by Mr Sulzer. He was particularly anxious to have the air as free as possible from moisture. For this purpose, having detached the short leg of the syphon, which was 3.4 inches long, he boiled mercury in it, and filled it with mercury boiling hot. He took a tinsel vessel of sufficient capacity, and put into it a quantity of powdered quicklime just taken from the kiln; and having closed the mouth, he agitated the lime through the air in the vessel, and allowed it to remain there all night. He then emptied the mercury out of the syphon into this vessel, keeping the open end far within it. By this means the short leg of the syphon was filled with very dry air. The other part was now joined, and boiled mercury put into the bend of the syphon; and the experiment was then prosecuted with mercury which had been recently boiled, and was the same with which the barometer had been carefully filled.\n\nThe results of the experiments are expressed in the following table:\n\n|        | Dry Air | Moist Air | Damp Air |\n|--------|---------|-----------|----------|\n| D      | E       | D         | E        | D       | E        |\n| 1,000  | 1,000   | 1,000     | 1,000    | 1,000   | 1,000    |\n| 2,000  | 1,957   | 2,000     | 1,920    | 2,000   | 1,909    |\n| 3,000  | 2,848   | 3,000     | 2,839    | 3,000   | 2,845    |\n| 4,000  | 3,737   | 4,000     | 3,726    | 4,000   | 3,718    |\n| 5,000  | 4,930   | 5,500     | 5,000    | 5,500   | 5,104    |\n| 6,000  | 5,342   | 6,000     | 5,452    | 6,000   | 5,403    |\n| 7,620  | 6,490   | 7,620     | 6,775    | 7,620   | 6,812    |\n\nHere it appears again in the clearest manner that the elasticities do not increase as fast as the densities, and the differences are even greater than in Mr Sulzer's experiments.\n\nThe second table contains the results of experiments made on very damp air in a warm summer's morning. In these it appears that the elasticities are almost precisely proportional to the densities + a small constant quantity, nearly 0.11, deviating from this rule chiefly between the densities 1 and 1.5, within which limits we have very nearly $D = \\frac{E}{1.097}$. As this air is nearer to the constitution of atmospheric air than the former, this rule may be safely followed in cases where atmospheric air is concerned, as in measuring the depths of pits by the barometer.\n\nThe third table shows the compression and elasticity of air strongly impregnated with the vapours of camphire. Here the Boylean law appears pretty exact, or rather the elasticity seems to increase a little faster than the density.\n\nDr Hooke examined the compression of air by immersing a bottle to great depths in the sea, and weighing the water which got into it without any escape of air. But this method was liable to great uncertainty, on account of the unknown temperature of the sea at great depths.\n\nHitherto we have considered only such air as is not Mode of rarer than what we breathe; we must take a very different method for examining the elasticity of rarefied air.\n\nLet $gh$ (fig. 67.) be a long tube, formed at top into Fig. 67. a cup, and of sufficient diameter to receive another smaller tube $af$, open at first at both ends. Let the outer tube and cup be filled with mercury, which will rise in the inner tube to the same level. Let $af$ now be stopped at $a$. It contains air of the same density and elasticity with the adjoining atmosphere. Note exactly the space $ab$ which it occupies. Draw it up into the position of fig. 68, and let the mercury stand in it at the height $de$, while $ce$ is the height of the mercury in the barometer. It is evident that the column $de$ is in equilibrium between the pressure of the atmosphere and the elasticity of the air included in the space $ad$. And since the weight of $ce$ would be in equilibrium with the whole pressure of the atmosphere, the weight of $cd$ is equivalent to the elasticity of the included air. While therefore $ce$ is the measure of the elasticity of the surrounding atmosphere, $cd$ will be the measure of the elasticity of the included air; and since the air originally occupied the space $ab$, and has now expanded into $ad$, we have $\\frac{ab}{ad}$ for the measure of its density. N.B.\n\n$ce$ and $cd$ are measured by the perpendicular heights of the columns, but $ab$ and $ad$ must be measured by their solid capacities.\n\nBy raising the inner tube still higher, the mercury will also rise higher, and the included air will expand still farther, and we obtain another $cd$, and another $\\frac{ab}{ad}$; and in this manner the relation between the density and elasticity of rarefied air may be discovered.","sp":318,"ep":322},{"h":"THIS EXAMINATION MAY BE MANAGED MORE EASILY BY","t":"s examination may be managed more easily by means of the air-pump. Suppose a tube $ae$ (fig. 69.) means of containing a small quantity of air $ab$, let up in a cistern the air of mercury, which is supported in the tube at the height pump.","sp":322,"ep":322},{"h":"THIS IS BY NO","t":"s is by no means an easy question, and considerable objections may be raised against any definition that has been given of it. Sir Isaac Newton says, that a fluid is a body whose particles yield to the smallest impression, and by so yielding are easily moved among themselves. It may be doubted whether this be sufficiently precise; what is meant by the smallest impression? and what is easily moving? Is there any precise degree of impression to which they do not yield; and do they oppose any resistance to motion? And a stronger objection may be made: It is not clear that a body so constituted will exhibit all the appearances which a body acknowledged to be fluid does really exhibit. Euler offers some very plausible reasons for doubting whether it will account for the horizontal surface, and the complete propagation of pressure through the fluid in every direction; and therefore prefers selecting this last phenomenon, the propagation of pressure, aqua-vertum, as the characteristic of fluidity, because a body having this constitution (on whatever circumstances it may depend) will have every other observed property of a fluid. But this definition is hardly simple or perspicuous enough; and we think that the objections against Newton's more simple and intelligible definition are not unanswerable. Boscovich defines a fluid to be, a body whose particles exert the same mutual forces in all directions; and shows, that such particles must be indifferent, as to any position, with respect to each other. If no external force act on them, they will remain in every position, and will have no tendency to arrange themselves in one position rather than another; differing in this respect from the particles of solid, or soft, or viscous bodies; which require some force to change their respective positions, and which recover their positions again when but gently disturbed. He illustrates this distinction very beautifully, by comparing a parcel of balls thrown on quicksilver, and attracting each other, with a parcel of magnets in the same situation. The balls will stick together, but in any position; whereas the magnets will always affect a particular arrangement.\n\nWhen the characteristic phenomenon of fluidity has been selected, the philosopher proceeds to combine this force and property with gravity, and establishes the doctrines of equilibrium, hydrostatics, or of the pressure and equilibrium of heavy fluids, the propagation of this pressure in every direction; and demonstrates the horizontality of surface assumed by all perfect fluids.\n\nThese doctrines and principles enable us to determine several very interesting circumstances respecting the mutual pressure of solids and fluids on each other; the pressures exerted on the bottoms and sides of vessels; the support and whole mechanism of floating bodies, &c.\n\nHe then considers how fluids will move when their equilibrium of pressure is destroyed; and establishes the doctrine of hydraulics, containing all the modifications of this motion, arising from the form of the vessels, or from the intensity or direction of the pressure which occasions it. And this subject is completed by the consideration of the resistance which fluids oppose to the motion of solid bodies through them, and their impulse on bodies opposed to their action.\n\nThese are very important matters, being the foundations of many mechanical arts, and furnishing us with some of our most convenient and efficacious powers for impelling.\nMechanical Philosophy.\n\nThe importance and difficulty of these branches of science.\n\nIt is evident, that on these doctrines depend the knowledge of the motions of rivers and of waves; the buoyancy, equilibrium, and stability of ships; the motion of ships through the waters; the action of the winds on the sails; and the whole arts of marine construction and seamanship.\n\nThere is another general form of tangible matter which exhibits very different phenomena, which are also extremely interesting; we mean that of vapour. A vapour is a fluid; and all the vapours that we know are heavy fluids: they are therefore subject to all the laws of pressure and impulse, which have been considered under the articles HYDRODYNAMICS. But they are susceptible of great compression by the action of external forces, and expand again when these forces are removed. In consequence of this compression and expansion, the general phenomena of fluidity receive great and important modifications; and this class of fluids requires a particular consideration. As air is a familiar instance, this branch of mechanical philosophy has been called PNEUMATICS.\n\nUnder this head we consider the pressure of the atmosphere, and its effects, both on solid and fluid bodies. It produces the rise of waters or other fluids in pumps and syphons, and gives us the theory of their construction: it explains many curious phenomena of nature, such as the motions in the atmosphere, and their connection with the pressure of the air, and its effect on the barometer or weather-glass. Air, when in motion, is called wind; and it may be employed to impel bodies. The theory of its action, and of its resistance to moving bodies, are therefore to be considered in this place.\n\nBut besides their motions of progression, &c., such as we observe in winds, compressible or elastic fluids are susceptible of what may be termed internal motion; a kind of undulation, where the contiguous parts are thrown into tremulous vibrations, in which they are alternately condensed and rarefied; and these undulations are propagated along the mass of elastic fluid, much in the same way in which we observe waves to spread on the surface of water. What makes this an interesting subject of consideration is, that these undulations are the more ordinary causes of sound. A trembling chord, or string, or bell, agitates the air adjoining to it: these agitations are propagated along the air, and by its intervention agitate the organ of hearing. The mechanism of these undulations has been much studied, and furnishes a very beautiful theory of musical harmony.\n\nThe philosopher examines the law of compressibility of air and other elastic fluids; and thus gets the knowledge of the constitution of the atmosphere, and of the action of those fluids when employed to impel solid bodies. Gunpowder contains an immense quantity of permanently elastic air, which may be set at liberty by inflammation. When this is done at the bottom of a piece of ordnance, it will impel a ball along the barrel, and discharge it from the muzzle, in the same way that an arrow is impelled by a bow. And thus having discovered in what degree this air presses in proportion to its expansion, we discover its action on the ball through the whole length of the piece, and the velocity which it will finally communicate to it. Here then is contained a theory of artillery and of mines.\n\nChemistry teaches us, that most bodies can be converted by fire into elastic fluids, which can be employed to act on other bodies in the way of pressure or impulse. Thus they come under the review of the mechanical philosopher; and they have become interesting by being employed as moving forces in some very powerful machines. These discussions will nearly exhaust all the general mechanical phenomena. There remain some which are much more limited, but furnish very curious and important subjects of investigation.\n\nThe phenomena exhibited between lodestones or magnets and iron have long attracted attention; and the phenomena of which the polarity of the lodestone has been applied, namely, the directing the course of a ship through the ocean, have rendered these phenomena extremely interesting. They are specified by the term MAGNETISM. Considerable progress has been made in the arrangement and generalization of them; but we have by no means been able hitherto to bring them all under one simple fact. The attention has been too much turned to the discovery of the ultimate cause of magnetism; whereas we should have rather employed our ingenuity in discovering all the general laws, in the same manner as Kepler and Newton did with respect to the celestial phenomena, without troubling themselves with the cause of gravitation. Dr Gilbert of Colchester was the first who considered the magnetic phenomena in the truly philosophical manner; and his treatise De Magnete may be considered as the first and one of the most perfect specimens of the Baconian or inductive logic. It is indeed an excellent performance; and when we consider its date, 1580, it is a wonder. AEpinus's Tentamen Theoricum Magnetismi is a most valuable work, and contains all the knowledge which we have as yet of the subject.\n\nThere is another class of mechanical phenomena which have a considerable affinity with the magnetic; we mean the phenomena called ELECTRICAL. Certain bodies, when rubbed or otherwise treated, attract and repel other bodies, and occasion a great variety of sensible motions in the neighbouring bodies. Philosophers have paid much attention to these appearances of late years, and established many general laws concerning them. But we have not been more successful in bringing them all under one fact, and thus establishing a complete theory of them, than in the case of magnetism. Franklin and AEpinus are the authors who have been most successful in this respect. Dr Franklin in particular has acquired great celebrity by his most sagacious comparison of the phenomena; which has enabled him to establish a few general laws, almost as precise as those of Kepler, and of equally extensive influence. His discovery too of the identity of thunder and electricity has given an importance and dignity to the whole subject.\n\nThere are many phenomena of electricity which cannot be called mechanical, and are of the most curious and interesting kind. As these have little connection with any of the other great branches of physical science, they have generally been considered in treatises of natural philosophy; and along with inquiries into the original cause of electricity in general, continue to engage much of our attention.\n\nThe appearances which are presented to us by our senses\nMechanical sense of seeing form another clas, which have always been considered as making a branch of natural philosophy in all seminaries of learning. It does not, however, ever, obviously appear, that they are mechanical phenomena of vision. The intimate nature of light is still a secret.\n\nFortunately it is not necessary to be known to give us a very perfect theory of the chief phenomena. The general laws of optics are so few, so simple, and so precise, that our theories are perhaps more perfect here than in any other branch of physics; but these theories are as yet far removed from the rank of primary facts. Many unknown events happen before the phenomenon comes under the hands of the ordinary optician, so as to become the subjects of the simple laws of reflection and refraction. It may even be doubted, and has been doubted, whether the phenomena of optics are cases of body in motion; whether all the lines which the optician draws are any thing but the directions along which certain quantities are exerted. The side of a ball which is next the candle may be bright and the other side dark, just as the side of a ball which is next the electrical globe is minus and the other side plus; and all this without any intervening medium. Apparition or visibility may be a quality of a body, depending on the proximity and position of another body, without anything between them, just as weight is; and this quality may be cognizable by our faculty of seeing alone, just as the pressure of a heavy body is by our feeling alone.\n\nThe first thing which made it probable that mechanical philosophy had anything to do with the phenomena of optics, was the discovery of Mr Roemer, \"that appearance was not instantaneous,\" that some time elapsed between the illumination of a body and its being seen at a distance. He discovered, that it was not till 40 minutes after the sun illuminated one of Jupiter's satellites that it was seen by an inhabitant of this globe. If therefore a sun were just created, it would be 45 minutes before Jupiter would be illuminated by him, and 200 before the Georgian planet would be illuminated. Here then is motion. It is therefore highly probable that there is something moved; but it is still doubted whether this something, which we call light, is a matter emitted from the shining body, and moving with great velocity, and acting on and affected by other bodies, in the various phenomena of optics, or whether it is a certain state of a medium which is thus propagated, as we see that waves are propagated along the surface of water, or porous undulations through the mass of air, while the water or air itself is hardly moved out of its place. Either of these suppositions makes optics a legitimate branch of mechanical philosophy; and it is the philosopher's business to examine both by the received laws of motion, and see which of them gives consequences which tally with the phenomena. This has been done; and we imagine that a complete incompatibility has been demonstrated between the consequences of the undulations of an elastic medium, and the phenomena of optics; while the consequences of the other or vulgar notion on this subject are perfectly consistent with mechanical laws. There are some things in this hypothesis very far beyond our power to conceive distinctly; but they are all similar in this respect to many facts acknowledged by all; and there is no phenomenon that is inconsistent with the legitimate consequences of the hypothesis. This gives it great probability; and this probability is confirmed by many chemical facts, and by facts in the vegetable economy, which give strong and almost undeniable indications of light being a body capable of a chemical union with the other ingredients of sublunary bodies, and of being afterwards set at liberty under its own form, as the cause or medium of vision.\n\nBut these are questions similar to those about the cause of gravity, and totally unnecessary for establishing a complete theory of the optical phenomena, for explaining the nature of vision, the effects of optical instruments, the cause of colours, the phenomena of the rainbow, halos and parhelia, &c., &c., &c. Only all this theory is connected with the principles called mechanical.\n\nSuch is the field of observation to the mechanical philosopher of the present day. We may hope to extend it, and by degrees apply its doctrines even to the unfeeling motions which take place in chemistry and physiology. But we must, in the first place, perfect our knowledge of the field of observation, and description of the feasible motions and actions of bodies. Those of fluids still demand much investigation; and till these are thoroughly understood, it is not time to attempt penetrating further into the recesses of nature.\n\nIn the prosecution of this study, it is found that every change which can be observed in the state of a body, with respect to motion by the action of another body, is accompanied by an equal and opposite change in the state of that other body. Thus, in the phenomena of equal gravitation, it is observed that the deflections of the sun opposite to and planets are mutual. The same thing is observed in reaction, the actions of magnets on each other and on iron; it is also observed in the attractions and repulsions of electrical bodies; and it also obtains in all the phenomena of impulse and of corporeal prelude. It is therefore an universal law of motion, that action is always equal and opposite to reaction; but this must be considered merely as a matter of fact, a contingent law of nature, like that of gravitation. The contrary is perfectly conceivable, and involves no contradiction. That this is so, is evident from the proceedings of philosophers, who in every new case make it their business to discover by experiment whether this law was observed or not. It was among the last discoveries made by Sir Isaac Newton in his examination of celestial motions. This being the case, it should never be assumed as a principle of reasoning till its operation has been ascertained by observation.\n\nIt has been owing to this improper procedure that much the false reasoning has been introduced into mechanical philosophy, and particularly into the theory of impulsion or much the communication of motion by impulse. In considering this subject, a term has been introduced which has occasioned much wrangling and misconception; we mean the term inertia. It serves indeed to abbreviate language, but it has often misled the judgement. When used with cautious attention to every circumstance, it expresses nothing but the necessity of a cause to the production of any effect; but it is generally used as expressing a quality inherent in matter, by which it resists any change of state, or by which it maintains its present state. Matter is said to be inert; and as every thing which changes the motion of a body is called a force, and as this inertia of A is supposed to change the motion of B, it is called vis inertiae; and yet matter is said to be indifferent as to motion or rest, and to be inactive. These are...\nMechanical are surely very incongruous expressions. This obscure philosophy, discourse has arisen from the poverty of all languages, which are deficient in original terms, and therefore employ figurative ones. Force, action, resistance, are all appropriated terms related to our own exertions; and some resemblance between the external effects of these exertions and the effects of the connecting qualities of natural bodies, has made us use them in our disquisitions on these subjects. And as we are conscious that, in order to prevent our being pushed by another from our place, we must resist, exerting force; and that our resistance is the reason why this other man has not accomplished his purpose, we say, that the quiescent body resists being put in motion, and that its inertia is discovered by the diminution made in the motion of the impelling body: and upon the authority of this vis inertiae as a first principle, the phenomena of impulsion are explained, and the law of equal action and reaction is established.\n\nBut all this procedure is in contradiction to the rules of inductive logic; and the obscurity and confusion which has arisen from this original misconception, the consequent incongruity of language, and the awkward attempts that have been made to botch and accommodate it to the real state of things, have occasioned a dispute, and the only dispute, in natural philosophy which has not yet been settled, and never can be settled, while such misconceptions are allowed to remain.\n\nIf the word inertia be taken as expressing not a quality of matter, but a law of human judgment respecting matter, as expressing our necessity of inferring the agency of a moving force whenever we observe a change of motion, all difficulties will vanish, and the equality of action and reaction will be inferred, as it should be, from the phenomena of collision. There will be inferred a vis inusta corpori impellenti, not quid movendi, but quid corpori; and this inference will carry us through all the mysteries of corporeal action, as it conducted Sir Isaac Newton in his grand researches.\n\nLet us just consider how we reason in a new case. Let A and B be two magnets fastened on the ends of two long wooden laths AE, BF, which turn horizontally on pivots C, D, like compass needles, with their north poles facing each other, 12 inches apart; and let A be pushed towards B, so that it would move uniformly with the velocity of two inches in a second. The phenomena which have been observed are as follow: A will gradually diminish its velocity; and when it has advanced about nine inches, will stop completely. B, in the mean time will gradually acquire motion; and when it has advanced about nine inches, will have a velocity of about two inches per second, with which it will continue to move uniformly. Now what is inferred from these phenomena? Because the motion of A is gradually retarded, we infer that a retarding force, that is, a force in the direction BA, has acted on it. And since this would not have happened if B had not been there, and always happens when B is there, we infer that B is either its cause or the occasion of its action.\n\nThe vulgar say that B repels A; so say the dynamists. The abettors of invisible fluids say, that a stream of fluid issuing from B impels A in the opposite direction. All naturalists agree in saying, that an active force connected with B has destroyed the motion of A, and consider this curious phenomenon as the indication and characteristic of a discovery. The same inference is made from the motion produced in B: it is considered by all as effected by a force exerted or occasioned by the presence of A; and the dynamists and the vulgar say that A repels B. And both parties conclude, from the equal changes made on both bodies, that the changing forces are equal; here acknowledging, that they observe an equality of action and reaction; and they add this to the other instances of the extent of this law of motion.\n\nAll this while no one thinks of the inertia or inactivity of B, but, on the contrary, conclude this to be a curious instance of its activity; and most people conclude that both bodies carry about with them a vis inertiae both when at rest and when in motion.\n\nIf other phenomena give unquestionable evidence it is doubted that, in ordinary collisions, there is the same changeful whether of motion, produced without mathematical contact, the fact has same inferences must be drawn; and a scrupulous nature ever been ralif will doubt whether contact should make any change observed, in our reasonings on the subject, and whether actual contact ever has been or can be observed. He will also be convinced, that while this is the general, or perhaps universal, process of nature in producing motion by impulse, all explanations of the action of bodies &c. &c., &c., by the intervention of ethers and other invisible fluids, or supposing nothing but multiplying the difficulties; for in place of one fact, the approach of one magnet (for instance) ethers, &c., to another, they substitute millions of unseen impulses, each of which equally needs an explanation. And if this fluid be supposed to produce its effects by any peculiarity in its constitution, as in the case of Newton's elastic ether propounded by him to explain gravitation, the hypothesis substitutes, in the most unqualified manner, millions of similar phenomena for the one to be explained; for there is the same want of a second fluid in order to produce that mutual recollection of the particles of the ether which constitutes its elasticity.\n\nAnd this seems to be the limit to our inquiries into the quality all the classes of natural phenomena. We find the mass of bodies or the particles of matter endowed in fact with qualities which affect the state of other particles or masses, at other bodies smaller or at greater distances from each other according to certain general rules or laws. This ultimate step is taken by us, the constitution of things is inferutable by us. It is arrogance in the highest degree for us to say, that because we do not comprehend how there is inherent in a body any quality by which another body may be affected at any distance from it, therefore no such quality is possible. It is no less for us to say, that matter has no active property but that of moving other matter by impulse; and that because it may be so moved, and also by the agency of our own minds, therefore, when it is not moved by impulse, it is moved by minds. The same almighty fiat which brought a particle of matter into existence could bring those qualities equally into existence; and the law in both is equally beyond our comprehension.\n\nBut, on the other hand, we must guard against the not, however curious relying on this consideration as a stop to further, deeper inquiry. There may be species of matter possible further inquiries.\nMechanical fed of the mechanical powers, and which notwithstanding-\ning is not cognizable by our senses. All the properties of matter are not known to a person who is both deaf and blind; and beings possessed of more senses may perceive matter where we do not; and many phenomena may really be produced by the action of intervening matter, which we, from indolence or from haste, ascribe to the agency of inherent forces. The industry of philosophers has already discovered intermediate in some cases. It is now certain that air is the conveyer of sound, and it is almost certain that there is such a thing as light. Let us therefore indulge conjectures of this kind, and examine the conjectures by the received laws of motion, and reject them when we find the smallest inconsistency; and always keep in mind that even the most coincident with the phenomena is still but a possibility.\n\nWe may conclude the whole of these observations with the remark, that these questions about the activity or inactivity of matter are not physical, but metaphysical. Natural philosophy, it is true, commonly takes it for granted that matter is wholly inactive; but it is not at any moment in physics whether this opinion be true or false; whether matter be acted on according to certain laws, or whether it act of itself according to the same laws, makes no difference to the natural philosopher. It is his business to discover the laws which really obtain, and to apply these to the solution of subordinate phenomena; but whether these laws arise from the nature of some agent external to matter, or whether matter itself is the agent, are questions which may be above his comprehension, and do not immediately concern his proper business.\n\nThe account we have now given of natural philosophy points out to us in the plainest manner the way in which the study must be prosecuted, and the helps which must be taken from other branches of human knowledge.\n\nThe causes, powers, forces, or by whatever name we choose to express them, which produce the mechanical phenomena of the universe, are not observed, and are known to us only in the phenomena themselves. Our knowledge of the mechanical powers of nature must therefore keep pace with our knowledge of the motions, and indeed is nothing different from it. In order to discover and determine the forces by which the moon is retained in her orbit round the earth, we must know her motions. To a terrestrial spectator she appears to describe an ellipse, having the earth in one focus; but, in the mean time, the earth is carried round the sun, and the moon's real path, in absolute space, is a much more complicated figure. Till we know this figure, and the variations in the velocity with which it is described, we know nothing of the forces which actuate the moon in her orbit.\n\nWhen Newton says that the forces by which she is retained in this elliptical orbit are directed to the earth, what does he mean? Only this, that the deflections from that uniform rectilinear motion which she would otherwise have performed are always in this direction. In like manner, when he says that these forces are inversely proportional to the squares of their distances from the earth, he only means that the deflections made in equal times in different parts of her motion are in this proportion.\n\nThese deflections are considered as the characteristics and measures of the forces. We imagine that we have made all plain when we call this indicated cause a tendency to the earth; but we have no notion of this tendency to the earth different from the approach itself. This word tendency, so fashionable among the followers of Sir Isaac Newton, is perverted from its pure and original sense. Tendere versus sollem, is, in the language of Rome, and also of Newton, to go towards the sun; but we now use the words tend, tendency, to signify, not the approach, but the cause of this approach. And when called upon to speak still plainer, we desert the safe paths of plain language, and we express ourselves by metaphor; speaking of nufus, conatus sepe mutua accedende, vis centripeta, &c. When these expressions have become familiar, the original sense of the word is forgotten, and we take it for granted that the words never had another meaning; and this metaphor, sprung from the poverty of language, becomes a fruitful source of misconception and mistake. The only way to secure ourselves against such mythical notions as are introduced by these means into philosophy, is to have recourse to the way in which we acquire the knowledge of these fancied powers; and then we see that their names are only names for phenomena, and that universal gravitation is only a universal mutual approach among the parts of the solar system.\n\nThere is one case in which we fondly imagine that we know the cause independent of the effect, and that if we could have predicted the phenomenon a priori, we should mean the case of impulse: and hence it is that we are prone to reduce every thing to cases of impulsion, and that we have fallen upon all these subterfuges of ethers and other subtle fluids. But we might have saved ourselves all this trouble; for after having by much false reasoning and gratuitous assumptions, shown that the phenomenon in question might have been produced by impulse, we are no nearer our purpose, because that property by which matter in motion puts other matter in motion, is known to us only by and in the effect.\n\nThe fair and logical deduction from all this is, that we must not expect any knowledge of the powers of nature, the immediate causes of the motions of bodies, but by means of a knowledge of the motions themselves; and that every mistake in the motions is accompanied by a similar mistake in the causes. It is impossible to demonstrate or explain the gravitation of the planets to him who is ignorant of the properties of the ellipse, or the theory of gunnery to him who does not know the parabola.\n\nA notion has of late gained ground, that a man may become a natural philosopher without mathematical knowledge; but this is entertained by none who have any acquaintance with mathematics themselves; and surely those who are ignorant of mathematics should not be trusted as judges in this matter. We need only appeal to fact. It is only in mathematical parts of natural philosophy which have been mathematically treated, that the investigations have been carried on with certainty, success, and utility. Without this guide, we must expect nothing but a school-boy's knowledge, resembling that of the man who takes up his religious creed on the authority of his priest, and can neither give a reason for what he imagines that he believes.\nMechanical philosophy, nor apply it with confidence to any valuable purpose in life. We may read and be amused with the trifling or vague writings of a Nollet, a Ferguson, or a Priestley; but we shall not understand, or profit by the truths communicated by a Newton, a D'Alembert, or De la Grange.\n\nThese observations, on the other hand, show us the nature of the knowledge which may be acquired, and the rank which natural philosophy holds among the sciences.\n\nMotions are the real and only objects of our observation, the only subjects of our discussion. In motion are included no ideas but those of space and time, the subjects of pure mathematical disquisition. As soon, therefore, as we have discovered the fact, the motion, all our future reasonings about this motion are purely mathematical, depending only on the affections of figure, number, and proportion, and must carry along with them that demonstration and irresistible evidence which is the boast of that science. To this are we indebted for that accuracy which is attained, and the progress which has been made in some branches of mechanical philosophy; for when the motions are distinctly and minutely understood, and then considered only as mathematical quantities, independent of all physical considerations, and we proceed according to the just rules of mathematical reasoning, we need not fear any intricacy of combination or multiplicity of steps; we are certain that truth will accompany us, even though we do not always attend to it, and will emerge in our final proposition, in the same manner as we see happen in a long and intricate algebraic analysis.\n\nMechanical philosophy, therefore, which is cultivated in this way, is not a system of probable opinions, but a disciplina accurata, a demonstrative science. To profess it, however, in this form, requires considerable preparation. The mere elements of geometry and algebra are by no means sufficient. Newton could not have proceeded sine \"fua mathesi faciem preferente;\" and, in creating a new science of physics, he was obliged to search for and discover a new source of mathematical knowledge. It is to be lamented that the taste for the mathematical sciences has so prodigiously declined in this country of late years; and that Britain, which formerly took the lead in natural philosophy, should now be the country where they are least cultivated. Few among us know more than a few elementary doctrines of equilibrium: while, on the continent, we find many authors who cultivate the Newtonian philosophy with great assiduity and success, and whose writings are consulted as the fountains of knowledge by all our countrymen who have occasion to employ the discoveries in natural philosophy in the arts of life. It is to the foreign writers that we have recourse in our seminaries, even for elementary treatises; and while the continent has supplied us with most elaborate and useful treatises on various articles, in physical astronomy, practical mechanics, hydraulics, and optics, there has not appeared in Britain half a dozen treatises worth consulting for these last forty years; and this notwithstanding the unparalleled munificence of our present sovereign, who has given more liberal patronage to the cultivators of mathematical philosophy, and indeed of science in general, than any prince in Europe. The magnificent establishments of Louis XIV. originated mechanical from his infatuated ambition and desire of universal influence, directed by the sagacious Colbert. And his patronage being exerted according to a regular plan in the establishment of pensioned academics, and in procuring the combined efforts of the most eminent of all countries, his exertions made a conspicuous figure, and filled all Europe with his eulogists. But all this was done without the smallest self-denial, or retrenchment of his own pleasures, the expenses being furnished out of the public revenues of a great and oppressed nation; whereas the voyages of discovery, the expensive observations and geodetical operations in Britain, and the numberless unheard-of pensions and encouragements given to men of science and activity, were all furnished out of the private estate of our excellent sovereign, who seems to delight in repaying, by every service in his power, the attachment of a loyal and happy nation. It is therefore devoutly to be wished that his patriotic efforts were properly seconded by those whom they are intended to serve, and that the taste for the mathematical sciences may again turn the eyes of Europe to this country for instruction and improvement. The present seems a most favourable era, while the amazing advances in manufactures of every kind seem to call aloud for the affluence of the philosopher. What pleasure would it have given to Newton or Halley to have seconded the ingenious efforts of a Watt, a Boulton, a Smeaton, an Arkwright, a Dollond? and how mortifying is it to see them indebted to the services of a Belidor, a Boilat, a Clairaut, a Bofcovitch?\n\nWe hope to be pardoned for this digression, and return to our subject.\n\nIt appears from what has been said, that mechanical philosophy is almost wholly a mathematical study, philosophy and that it is to be successfully prosecuted only under a whole this form: but in our endeavours to initiate the young mathematician, it will be often found to require more steadiness of thought than can generally be expected for keeping the mind engaged in such abstract speculations. The object presented to the mind is not readily apprehended with that vivacity which is necessary for enabling us to reason upon it with clearness and steadiness, and it would be very desirable to have some means of rendering the conception more easy, and the attention more lively. This may be done by exhibiting to the eye an experiment, which, though but a minute's, single fact, gives us a sensible object of perception, however, which we can contemplate and remember with much more steadiness than any mere creature of the imagination. We could, by an accurate description, give young such a conception of a room that the hearer should minds perfectly comprehend our narration of any occurrence in it: but one moment's glance at the room would be infinitely better. It is usual therefore to employ experiments to assist the imagination of the beginner; and most courses of natural philosophy are accompanied by a series of such experiments. Such experiments, connected by a flight train of argumentative discourse, may even serve to give a notion of the general doctrines, sufficient for an elegant amusement, and even tending to excite curiosity and engage in a serious prosecution of the study. Such are the usual courses which go by the name of experimental philosophy; but this is\nEXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY is the investigation of general laws, as yet unknown, by experiment; and it has been observed, under the article PHILOSOPHY, that this is the most infallible (and indeed the sole) way of arriving at the knowledge of them. This is the Novum Organum Scientiarum strongly recommended by Lord Bacon. It was new in his time, though not altogether without example; for it is the procedure of nature, and is followed whenever curiosity is excited.\n\nThere was even extant in his time a very beautiful example of this method, viz. the Treatise of the Loadstone, by Dr Gilbert of Colchester; a work which has hardly been excelled by any, and which, when we consider its date, about the year 1580, is really a wonderful performance.\n\nThe most perfect model of this method is the Optics of Sir Isaac Newton. Dr Black's Essay on Magnesia is another very perfect example. Dr Franklin's Theory of Electricity is another example of great merit. That the investigation is not complete, nor the conclusions certain, is not an objection. The method is without fault; and a proper direction is given to the mind for the experiments which are still necessary for establishing the general laws.\n\nIt were much to be wished that some person of talents and of extensive knowledge would give a treatise on the method of inquiry by experiment. Although many beautiful and successful examples have been given as particular branches of inquiry, we have but too many instances of very inaccurate and inconclusive investigations. Experiments made at random, almost without a view, serve but little to advance our knowledge. They are like shapeless lumps of stone merely detached from the rock, but still wanting the skill of the builder to select them for the different purposes which they may chance to serve; while well-contrived experiments are blocks cut out by a skilful workman, according as the quarry could furnish them, and of forms suited to certain determined uses in the future edifice. Every little series of experiments by Margraff terminates in a general law, while hardly any general conclusion can be drawn from the numberless experiments of Pott. Lord Bacon has written much on this subject, and with great judgment and acuteness of distinction; but he has exceeded in this, and has fatigued his readers by his numerous rules; and there is in all his philosophical works, and particularly in this, a quaintness and affectation that greatly obscure his meaning, so that this most valuable part of his writings is very little read.\n\nA formidable objection has been made to this method of inquiry. Since a physical law is only the expression of a general fact, and is established only in consequence of our having observed a similarity in a great number of particular facts; and since the great rule of inductive logic is to give the law no greater extent than the induction on which it is founded\u2014how comes it that a few experiments must be received as the foundation of a general inference? This has been answered in very general terms in the article PHILOSOPHY. But it will be of use to consider the subject a little more particularly. Our observations on this subject are taken from the dissertation on evidence by Dr Campbell in his Philosophy of Rhetoric.\n\nAn attentive consideration of the objects around us, will inform us that they are generally of a complicated nature, not only as consisting of a complication of those qualities of things called accidents, such as gravity, mobility, colour, figure, solidity, which are common to all bodies; but also as consisting of a mixture of flowing the variety of substances, very different in their nature and properties; and each of these is perhaps compounded of ingredients more simple.\n\nMoreover, the farther we advance in the knowledge of nature, we find the more reason to be convinced of her constancy in all her operations. Like causes have always produced like effects, and like effects have always been preceded by like causes. Inconstancy sometimes appears in Nature's works at first sight; but a more refined experience shows us that this is but an appearance, and that there is no inconstancy: and we explain it to our satisfaction in this way.\n\nMost of the objects being of a complicated nature, we find, on an accurate scrutiny, that the effects attributed to them ought often to be solely ascribed to one or more of these component parts, while the others either do not contribute to them, or hinder their production; and the variety of nature is so great, that hardly any two individuals of the same species are in every respect like any other. On all these accounts we expect difficulties in the phenomena accompanying perfectly similar treatment of different subjects of the same kind; but we find, that whenever we can be assured that the two substances are perfectly alike, the phenomena arising from similar treatment are the same: and long and extensive observation teaches us, that there are certain circumstances which insure us in the perfect similarity of constitution of some things. Whenever we observe the effect of any natural agent on one, and but one, of these, we invariably expect that the same will be produced on any other.\n\nShould a botanist meet with a plant new to him, and observe that it has seven monopetalous flowers, he will conclude with the utmost confidence that every plant of this species will have monopetalous flowers; but he will not suppose that it will have seven, and no more than seven, flowers. Now these two facts seem to have no difference to warrant such a difference in the conclusion; which may therefore seem capricious, since there is but one example of both.\n\nBut it is not from this example only that he draws the conclusion. Had he never before taken notice of any plant, he would not have reasoned at all from these remarks. But his mind runs immediately from this unknown species to all the known species of this genus, and to all the genera of the same order; and having experienced in the figure of the flower an uniformity in every species, genus, and order, which admits of no exception, but, in the number of flowers, a variety as boundless as are the circumstances of soil, climate, age, and culture, he learns to mark the difference, and draws the above-mentioned conclusions. Thus we learn, that perfect uniformity is not to be expected in any instance whatever, because in no instance is the simplicity of constitution sufficiently great to give us assurance of perfect uniformity in the circumstances of the case; and the ut-\nmost that our experience can teach us is a quick differentiation of those circumstances which produce the occasional varieties.\n\nThe nearer that our investigations carry us to the knowledge of elementary natures, the more are we convinced by general experience of the uniformity of the operations of real elements; and although it may perhaps be impossible for us ever to arrive at the knowledge of the simplest elements of any body, yet when anything appears simple, or rather so exactly uniform, as that we have invariably observed it to produce similar effects on discovering any new effect of this substance, we conclude, from a general experience of the efficient, a like constancy in the energy as to the reft. Fire consumes wood, melts lead, and hardens clay. In these instances it acts uniformly, but not in these only. We have always found, that whatever of any species is consumed by it in one instance, has been consumed by it on trial at any time. If therefore a trial be made for the first time of its influence on any particular substance, he who makes it is warranted to conclude that the effect, whatever it may be, is a faithful representative of its effects on this substance in all past and future ages. This conclusion is not founded on this single instance, but upon this instance combined with the general experience of the regularity of this element in its operations.\n\nThis general conclusion, therefore, drawn from one experiment, is by no means in opposition to the great rule of inductive logic, but, on the contrary, it is the most general and refined application of it. General laws are here the real subject of consideration; and a law still more general, viz. that nature is constant in all its operations, is the inference which is here applied as a principle of explanation of a phenomenon which is itself a general law, viz. that nature is constant in this operation.\n\nThe foundation of this general inference from one experiment being so firmly established, it is evident that experiments must be an infallible method of attaining to the knowledge of nature; and we need only be solicitous that we proceed in a way agreeable to the great rule of inductive logic; that is, the subject must be cleared of every accidental and unknown circumstance, and put into a situation that will reduce the interfering circumstance to a state of the greatest possible simplicity. Thus we may be certain that the event will be a faithful representative of every similar case; and unless this be done in the preparation, nothing can result from the most numerous experiments but uncertainty and mistakes.\n\nThe account which has been given of mechanical philosophy would seem to indicate that experiment was not of much use in the farther prosecution of it. The two laws of motion, with the affluence of mathematics, seem fully adequate to the explanation of every phenomenon; and so they are to a certain degree. But this degree is as yet very limited. Our mathematical knowledge, great as it is in comparison with that of former times, is still insufficient for giving accurate solutions even of very simple (comparatively speaking) questions. We can tell, with the utmost precision, what will be the motions of two particles of matter, or two bodies, which act on each other with forces proportioned to the squares of the distances inversely; but if we add a third particle, or a third body, acting by the same law, the unit experimental science of all Europe can only give an approximation to the solution.\n\nWhat is to be done then in the cases which come continually before us, where millions of particles are experiment acting at once on each other in every variety of situation and distance? How shall we determine, for instance, the motion of water through a pipe or sluice when urged by a piston or by its own weight? what will be its velocity and direction? It is impossible, in the present state of mathematical knowledge, to tell with any precision or certainty. And here we must have recourse to experiment. But if this be the case, must the experiment be made in every possible variety of situation, depth, figure, pressure? or is it possible to find out any general rules, founded on the general laws of motion, and rationally deduced from them? Or, if this cannot be accomplished, will experiment itself furnish any general coincidences which show such mutual dependences, that we may consider them as indications of general principles, though subordinate, complicated, and perhaps irrefutable? This can be discovered by experiment alone.\n\nThe attention of philosophers has been directed to accurate each of these three chances, and considerable progress experiment has been made in them all. Numerous experiments not always have been made, almost sufficient to direct the practice be made, in many important cases, without the help of any rule or principle whatever. But there are many cases, and these of by far the greatest importance, such as the motion of a ship impelled by the winds, resisted by the water, and tossed by the waves, where distinct experiments cannot be made.\n\nNewton, Bernoulli, d'Alembert, and others, have laboured hard to deduce from the laws of motion rules necessary for determining what may be called the average motion of water in these circumstances, without attempting to define the path or motion of any individual particle; and they have actually deduced many rules which have a great degree of probability. It may here be asked, why do you say probability? the rules, as far as they go, should be certain. So they are: they are first deductions from their premises. But the premises are only suppositions, of various degrees of probability, assumed in order to simplify the circumstances of the case, and to give room for mathematical reasoning; therefore these deductions, these rules, must be examined by experiment. Some of the suppositions are such as can hardly be refused, and the rules deduced from them are found to tally precisely with the phenomena. Such is this, \"that the velocities of inflowing water in similar circumstances are in the sub-duplicate ratio of the pressures.\" And this rule gives a most important and extensive information to the engineer. Other suppositions are more gratuitous, and the rules deduced from them are less coincident with the phenomena. The patient and sagacious Newton has repeatedly failed in his attempts to determine what is the absolute velocity of water inflowing from a hole in the bottom of a vessel when urged by its weight alone, and the attempts of the others have hardly succeeded better. Experiment is therefore absolutely necessary on this head.\n\nThose who have aimed at the discovery of rules purely experimental on this subject, have also been pretty successful; and the Chevalier Buat has, from a comparison,\nExperiments on an immense variety of experiments made by himself and various authors, deduced an empirical rule, which will not be found to deviate from truth above one part in ten in any case which has yet come to our knowledge.\n\nThis instance may serve to show the use of experiments in mechanical philosophy. It is proper in all cases by way of illustration; and it is absolutely necessary in most, either as the foundation of a characteristic of a particular class of phenomena, or as argument in support of a particular doctrine. Hydrostatics, hydraulics, pneumatics, magnetism, electricity, and optics, can hardly be studied in any other way; and they are at present in an imperfect state, and receiving continual improvement by the labours of experimental philosophers in all quarters of the world.\n\nHaving in the preceding paragraphs given a pretty full enumeration of the different subjects which are to be considered in the study of natural philosophy, it will not be necessary to spend much time in a detail of the advantages which may reasonably be expected from a successful prosecution of this study. It stands in no need of panegyric: its intimate connection with the arts gives it a sufficient recommendation to the attention of every person. It is the foundation of many arts, and it gives liberal assistance to all. Indebted to them for its origin and birth, it has ever retained its filial attachment, and repaid all their favours with the most partial affection.\n\nTo this science the navigator must have recourse for that astronomical knowledge which enables him to find his place in the trackless ocean; and although very small scraps of this knowledge are sufficient for the mere pilot, it is necessary that the study be prosecuted to the utmost by some persons, that the unlearned pilot may get that scanty pittance which must direct his routine. The few pages of tables of the sun's declination, which he uses every day to find his latitude, required the successive and united labours of all the astronomers of Europe to make them tolerably exact: and in order to ascertain his longitude with precision, it required all the genius of a Newton to detect the lunar irregularities, and bring them within the power of the calculator; and, till this was done, the reflexive position of the different parts of the earth could not be ascertained. Vain would have been the attempt to do this by geodetical surveys independent of astronomical observation. It is only from the most refined mechanics that we can hope for sure principles to direct us in the construction and management of a ship, the boast of human art, and the great means of union and communication between the different quarters of the globe.\n\nA knowledge of mechanics not much inferior to this is necessary for enabling the architect to execute some of his greatest works, such as the erection of domes and arches, which depend on the nicest adjustment of equilibrium. Without this he cannot unite economy with strength; and his works must either be clumsy masses or flimsy shells.\n\nThe effects of artillery cannot be understood or secured without the same knowledge.\n\nThe whole employment of the engineer, civil or military, is a continual application of almost every branch of mechanical knowledge; and while the promises of a Smeaton, a Watt, a Belidor, may be confided in as if already performed, the numberless failures and disappointments in the most important and costly projects show us daily the ignorance of the pretended crowd of engineers.\n\nThe microscope, the steam-engine, the thunder-rod, are preludes which the world has received from the natural philosopher; and although the compass and telescope were the productions of chance, they would have been of little service had they not been studied and improved by Gilbert, Halley, and Dollond.\n\nBut it is not in the arts alone that the influence of natural philosophy is perceived: it lends its aid to every science, and in every study.\n\nIt is often necessary to have recourse to the philosopher in disputes concerning property; and many examples might be given where great injustice has been the consequence of the ignorance of the judges. Knowledge of nature might have prevented many disgraceful condemnations for forgery.\n\nThe historian who is ignorant of natural philosophy in history, easily admits the miraculous into his narrations, accompanies these with his reflections, draws consequences from them, and fills his pages with prodigies, fables, and absurdity.\n\nIt is almost needless to speak of the advantages which will accrue to the physician from this study. So close is the connection between it and medicine, that our language has given but one name to the naturalist and to the medical philosopher. Indeed, the whole of his study is a close observation of the laws of material nature, in order to draw from them precepts to direct his practice in the noble art of healing. During the immaturity of general knowledge, while natural philosophy was the only study which had acquired any just pretension to certitude either in its principles or method of investigation, the physicians endeavoured to bring the objects of their study within its province, hoping by this means to get a more distinct view of it; and they endeavoured to explain the arbitrary phenomena of the animal functions by reducing them all to motions, vibrations, collisions, impulses, hydrostatic and hydraulic pressures and actions, with which the mechanical philosophers were so ardently occupied at that time. But unfortunately their acquaintance with nature was then very limited, and they were but little habituated to the rules of just reasoning; and their attempts to explain the economy of animal life by the laws of mechanics did them but little service either for the knowledge of diseases or of the methods of cure. The mechanical theories of medicine, which had considerable reputation about the end of the 17th century, were many of them very ingenious, and had an imposing appearance of symmetry and connection; but are now forgotten, having all been formed on the narrow supposition that matter was subject only to mechanical laws.\n\nBut the discovery of error diminishes the chance of again going wrong, especially when the cause of error has been discovered, and the means pointed out of detecting the mistakes; and the vital principle must combine its influence with, or operate on, the properties of rude matter. It appears therefore evident that a knowledge of the mechanical laws of the material world is not only a convenient, but a necessary, accomplishment to\nWe are fully justified in this opinion, by observing medical authors of the present day introducing into medicine theories borrowed from mechanical philosophy, which they do not understand, and which they continually misapply. Appearance of reasoning frequently conceals the errors in principle, and seldom fails to mislead.\n\nBut there is no class of men to whom this science is of more service than to those who hold the honourable office of the teachers of religion. Their knowledge in their own science, and their public utility, are prodigiously hurt by ignorance of the general frame and constitution of nature; and it is much to be lamented that this science is so generally neglected by them, or considered only as an elegant accomplishment; nay, it is too frequently thought as a dangerous attainment, as likely to unhinge their own faith, and taint the minds of their hearers. We hope, however, that few are either so feebly rooted in the belief of the great doctrines of religion as to fear this, or of minds so base and corrupted as to adopt and inculcate a belief which they have any suspicion of being ill-founded. But many have a sort of horror at all attempts to account for the events of nature by the intervention of general causes, and think this procedure derogatory to the Divine nature, and inconsistent with the doctrine of his particular providence; believing, that \"a sparrow does not fall to the ground without the knowledge of our heavenly Father.\" Their limited conceptions cannot perceive, that, in forming the general law, the Great Artist did at one glance see it in its remotest and most minute consequence, and adjust the vast assemblage so as completely to answer every purpose of His providence. There never was a more eager enquirer into the laws of nature, or more ardent admirer of its glorious Author, than the Hon. Robert Boyle. This gentleman says, that he will always think more highly of the skill and power of that artist who should construct a machine, which, being once set a going, would of itself continue its motion for ages, and from its inherent principles continue to answer all the purposes for which it was first contrived, than of him whose whole machine required the continual aid of the hand which first constructed it. It is owing to great inattention that this aversion to the operation of secondary causes has any influence on our mind. What do we mean by the introduction of secondary causes? How do we infer the agency of any cause whatever? Would we ever have supposed any cause of the operations of nature, had they gone on without any order or regularity? Or would such a chaos of events, any more than a chaos of existences, have given us any notion of a forming and directing hand? No surely. We see the hand of God in the regular and unvaried course of nature, only because it is regular and unvaried. The philosopher expresses this by saying, that the phenomena proceed by unalterable laws. Greatly mistaken therefore are they who think that we superfluous the existence of mind and of providence when we trace things to their causes. A physical law being an unvaried fact, is an indication, and the strongest possible indication, of an unerring mind, who is incapable of change, and must do to day what He always did: for to change is to deviate from what is best*. The operations of unerring mind will therefore be regular and invariable. Physical laws, therefore, or secondary causes, are the best proofs of unerring wisdom. Such regularity of conduct is universally considered as an indication of wisdom among men. The wise man is known by the constancy of his conduct, while no man can depend on the future conduct of a fool.\n\nAnd what astonishing evidences of wisdom do we not observe in the general laws of the material world? They will ever be considered by the intelligent philosopher as the most glorious display of inconceivable wisdom, which has been able, by means so few and so simple, to produce effects which by their grandeur astonish our feeble understandings, and by their inexhaustible variety elude all possibility of enumeration.\n\nWhile the teachers of religion remain ignorant of the beautiful laws of nature, the great characteristics of the wisdom and goodness of the Almighty Creator, their hearers are deprived of much sublime pleasure; God is robbed of that praise which he would have received from an enlightened people; and the only worship he receives is tainted with mean notions of his attributes, and groundless fears of his power.\n\nBut besides these advantages which accrue to different classes of men from this study, there are some effects which are general, and are too important to be passed over unnoticed.\n\nThat spirit of dispassionate experimental enquiry in which has so greatly promoted this study, will carry therewith it, into every subject of enquiry, that precision, and that constant appeal to fact and experience which characterize it. And we may venture to assert, that the superior good order and method which distinguish some of the later productions in other sciences, have been in a great measure owing to this mathematical spirit, the success of which in natural philosophy has gained it credit, and thus given it an unperceived influence even over those who have not made it their study.\n\nThe truths also which the naturalist discovers are more general, such as do not in general affect the passions of men, and have therefore a good chance of meeting with a candid reception. Those whose interest it is to keep men in political or religious ignorance, cannot easily suspect bad consequences from improvements in this science; and if they did, have hardly any pretext for checking its progress. And discoveries accustom the mind to novelty; and it will no longer be startled by any consequences, however contrary to common opinion. Thus the way is paved for a rational and direct scepticism, and a free enquiry on other subjects. Experiment, not authority, will be considered as the test of truth; and under the guidance of fair experience we need fear no ill as long as the laws of nature remain as they are.\n\nLastly, since it is the business of philosophy to describe the phenomena of nature, to discover their causes, to trace the connection and subordination of these causes, and thus obtain a view of the whole constitution of nature; it is plain that it affords the surest path for arriving at the knowledge of the great cause of all, of God himself, and for forming proper conceptions of him and of our relations to him: notions infinitely more just than can ever be entertained by the careless spectator of his works.

All these intelligent beings give indications of knowledge and of power; but their knowledge bears, in general, no proportion to their power of producing changes in nature, and of attaining important ends; and their power is neither always, nor in the most important cases, the consequence of their knowledge. Where the effect of their actions is most eminently conducive to their important interests, the power of attaining these valuable ends is generally independent on any attention to the fitness of the means, and the exertion is frequently made without even thinking of the important end. The well-being of the individual is secured against any danger from its ignorance, indolence, or inattention, by an instinctive propensity, which leads it to the performance of the necessary action, which is thus made immediately and ultimately desirable, without any regard to its ultimate and important end. Thus, in our own nature, the support of animal life, and the improvement of the means of subsistence by a knowledge of the objects which surround us, are not entrusted to our apprehensions of the importance of these ends, but are committed to the surer guides of hunger and curiosity.\n\nThe same observers discover a connection between the individuals of a class, different from that which connection arises from the mere resemblance of their external appearance, or even of their propensities and pursuits; the individuals of a very circumstances which produced the classification of animals. They observe, that these propensities are such, that while each individual seeks only its own enjoyment, the enjoyments are in general such as contribute to the support of the species and the enjoyment of other individuals. Thus, in the classes of animals, and in human nature, the continuance of the race, and the enjoyment of the whole, are not entrusted to the apprehension we entertain of the importance of these ends, but are produced by the operation of sexual love and the love of society.\n\nThe same observers find that even the different classes of sentient beings are connected together; and while to a link of the whole of each class aim only at their own enjoyment, they contribute, in some way or other, to the well-being of the other classes. Even man, the fifth class of different classes.\n\n(A) M. de la Mettrie, editor of the Journal de Physique. See his prefaces to the volumes for 1792 and 1793, January and July.\nlord of this sublunary world, is not the unconnected inhabitant of it. He cannot, in every instance, reap all the fruits of his situation, without contributing to the enjoyment of thousands of the brute creation. Nay, it may be proved to the satisfaction of every intelligent man, that while one race of animals, in consequence of its peculiar propensities, subsists by the destruction of another, the sum total of animal life and enjoyment is prodigiously increased. See a very judicious dissertation on this curious and puzzling subject, entitled *A Philosophical Survey of the Animal Creation*; where it appears that the increase of animal life and enjoyment which is produced by this means, beyond what could possibly obtain without it, is beyond all conception. See likewise the last edition of *King's Origin of Evil*, by Dr Law late bishop of Carlisle.\n\nThus the whole assemblage seems connected, and jointly employed in increasing the sum total of possible happiness. This fitness of the various propensities of sentient and intelligent beings, this subserviency to a general purpose, strikes these observers as a mark of intention, evidently distinct from, and independent of, all the particular intentions, and superior to them all; and thus it irresistibly leads them to infer the existence of a supreme mind, directing the whole of this intellectual system, while the individuals of which it consists appear the unconscious instruments in the hand of a great artist, with which he executes his grand and beneficent purposes.\n\nBut the observation goes yet further. The bodies of the inanimate creation are not only connected with each other by a mutual dependence of properties, and the relation of causation, but they are also connected with the sentient beings by a subserviency to their purposes of enjoyment. The philosopher observes that this connection is admirably kept up by the constancy of natural operations and the expectations of intelligent beings. Had either of these circumstances been wanting, had either the operations of nature been without rule, or had sentient beings no perception or expectation of their uniformity; the subserviency would be totally at an end. This adjustment, this fitness, of which the effect is the enjoyment of the sentient inhabitants of the universe, appear to be the effect of an intention of which this enjoyment is the final cause. This constancy therefore in the operations of nature, both in the intellectual and material world, and the concomitant expectation of sentient beings, appear the effects of laws imposed on the different parts of the universe by the Supreme Mind, who has formed both these classes of beings so admirably suited to each other.\n\nTo such observers the world appears a work of art, a system of means employed for gaining certain proposed ends, and it carries the thoughts forward to an artist; and we infer a degree of skill, power, and good intention in this artist, proportioned to the ingenuity, extent, and happy effect which we are able to discern in his works. Such a contemplation of nature, therefore, terminates in natural theology, or the discovery of the existence and attributes of God.\n\nOur notions of this Supreme Mind are formed from the indications of design which we observe, and which we interpret in the same way as in the actions of men. These notions, therefore, will differ from our notions of other minds only in the degrees which we are able to observe, and which we assign to these faculties; for the phenomenon or the effect is not only the mark, but also the measure of its supposed cause. These degrees must be ascertained by our own capacity of appreciating the extent, the multiplicity, and the variety of the contrivance. Accordingly, the attributes of the Supreme Mind, in the theological creed of a rude Indian, are much more limited than in that of a European philosopher. In proportion as our understandings are enlarged, and as our acquaintance with the operations of nature around us is extended, we shall perceive higher degrees of power, of skill, and of kind intention: and since we find that the scene of observation is unbounded, we cannot affix any boundaries to these attributes in our own imagination, and we are ready to suppose that they are infinite or unbounded in their own nature. When our attentive survey of this universe, and a careful comparison of all its parts, as far as we can understand or appreciate them, have made us conclude that it is one design, the work of one artist; we are under the necessity of inferring, that, with respect to this universe, his power, wisdom, and benevolence, are indeed infinite.\n\nWhen men have been led to draw this conclusion from the appearances of fitness which are observed everywhere of nature where around them, they consider that constancy which is governed by general laws, the intellective system, and that expectation of confidence in this constancy, which renders the universe a source of enjoyment to its sentient inhabitants, as the consequences of laws imposed by the Almighty Artist on his works, in the same manner as they would consider the constancy in the conduct of any people as the consequences of laws promulgated and enforced by the supreme magistrate.\n\nThere can be no doubt of this view of nature being the nature extremely captivating, and likely to engage the curiosity and propensity of speculative men; and it is not surprising that the study of the phenomena of mind have been keenly studied in all ages. This part of the study of nature, like all others, was first cultivated in subserviency to the wants of social life; and the general laws of moral sentiment were the first phenomena which were considered with attention. This gradually ripened into a regular system of moral duty, accompanied by its congenial study, the investigation or determination of the summum bonum, or the constituents of human felicity; and these two branches of intellectual science were always kept in a state of association by the philosophers of antiquity. Jurisprudence, the science of government, legislation, and police, were also first cultivated as arts, or at least in immediate subserviency to the demands of cultivated society; and all these so nearly related parts of the study of human nature, had made a very considerable progress, in the form of maxims or precepts for directing the conduct, before speculative men, out of mere curiosity, treated them as subjects of philosophical study. Our moral sentiments, always involving a feeling of obligation, are expressed in a language considerably different from the usual language of pure philosophy, speaking of things which ought to be, rather than of things which are; and this distinction of language was increased by the very aim of the writers,\nwhich was generally to influence the conduct as well as the opinions of their scholars. It was referred for modern times to bring this study into the pure form of philosophy, by a careful attention to the phenomena of moral sentiment, and clasping these according to their generality, and ascertaining their respective ranks by an appeal to experiment, that is, to the general conduct of mankind; and thus it happens that in the modern treatises on ethics, jurisprudence, &c., there is less frequent reference made to the officia or duties, or to the constituents of the summum bonum, than among the ancients, and a more accurate description of the human mind, and discrimination of its various moral feelings.\n\nIt was hardly possible to proceed far in these disquisitions without attending to the powers of the understanding. Differences of opinion were supported by reasonings, or attempts at reasoning. Both sides could not be in the right, and there must be some court of appeals. Rules of argumentation behoved to be acquiesced in by both parties; and it could hardly escape the notice of some curious minds, that there were rules of truth and falsehood as well as of right and wrong. Thus the human understanding became an object of study, first in subserviency to the demands of the moralists, but afterwards for its own sake; and it gradually grew up into the science of logic. Still further refinement produced the science of metaphysics, or the philosophy of universals. But all these were in fact posterior to the doctrines of morals; and disquisitions on beauty, the principles of taste, the precepts of rhetoric and criticism, were the last additions to the study of the phenomena of mind. And now, since the world seems to have acquiesced in the mode of investigation of general laws by experiment and observation, and to agree that this is all the knowledge that we can acquire of any subject whatever, it is to be expected that this branch of philosophical discussion will attain the same degree of improvement (estimated by the coincidence of the doctrines with fact and experience) that has been attained by some others.\n\nThe occupations, however, of ordinary life have often directed our efforts towards material objects, and engaged our attention on their properties and relations; and as all sciences have arisen from arts, and were originally implied in the maxims and precepts of those arts, till separated from them by the curious speculatist, the knowledge of the material system of nature was polished in detached scraps by the practitioners in the various arts of life long before the natural philosopher thought of collecting them into a body of scientific doctrines. But there have not been wanting in all ages men of curiosity who have been struck by the uniformity of the operations of nature in the material world, and were eager to discover their causes.\n\nAccordingly, while the moralists and metaphysicians turned their whole attention to the phenomena of mind, and have produced the sciences of pneumatology, logic, ethics, jurisprudence, and natural theology, these observers of nature have found sufficient employment in considering the phenomena of the material world.","sp":26,"ep":28}]
